The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance.

We find that mergers with 10-20% mass of the mass of the\nhost lead to the formation of thick disks whose characteristics are similar,\nboth in morphology as in kinematics, to those observed. Despite the relatively\nlarge mass ratios, the host disks are not fully destroyed by the infalling\nsatellites: a remaining kinematically cold and thin component containing\n~15-25% of the mass can be identified, which is embedded in a hotter and\nthicker disk.

The key difference between polytropic quark stars and the\npolytropic model studied previously for normal (i.e., non-quarkian) stars is\nrelated to two issues: (i) a constant term representing the contribution of\nvacuum energy may be added in the energy density and the pressure for a quark\nstar, but not for a normal star; (ii) the quark star models with non-vanishing\ndensity at the stellar surface are not avoidable due to the strong interaction\nbetween quarks. The first one implies that the vacuum inside a quark star is\ndifferent from that outside, while the second one is relevant to the effect of\ncolor confinement. The polytropic equations of state are stiffer than that\nderived in conventional realistic models (e.g., the bag model) for quark\nmatter, and pulsar-like stars calculated with a polytropic equation of state\ncould then have high maximum masses (> 2 M_sun).

The baseline design of the\nPierre Auger Observatory was optimized for the highest energies. The surface\narray is fully efficient above $3 \\times 10^{18}$ eV and, even if the hybrid\nmode can extend this range below $10^{18}$ eV, the second knee and a\nconsiderable portion of the wide ankle structure are left outside its operating\nrange. Therefore, in order to encompass these spectral features and gain\nfurther insight into the cosmic ray composition variation along the transition\nregion, enhancements to the surface and fluorescence components of the baseline\ndesign are being implemented that will lower the full efficiency regime of the\nObservatory down to $\\sim 10^{17}$ eV. The surface enhancements consist of a\ngraded infilled area of standard Auger water Cherenkov detectors deployed in\ntwo triangular grids of 433 m and 750 m of spacing.

The LSST design is\ndriven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking\nan inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and\nmapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited at\nCerro Pach\\'{o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m\neffective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel\ncamera. The standard observing sequence will consist of pairs of 15-second\nexposures in a given field, with two such visits in each pointing in a given\nnight. With these repeats, the LSST system is capable of imaging about 10,000\nsquare degrees of sky in a single filter in three nights. The typical 5$\\sigma$\npoint-source depth in a single visit in $r$ will be $\\sim 24.5$ (AB). The\nproject is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations\nby 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg$^2$ with\n$\\delta<+34.5^\\circ$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, $ugrizy$,\ncovering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm.

The CO emission is detected\nin the galactic disk and the extraplanar gas. The extraplanar CO emission\nfollows the morphology of the atomic gas closely but is less extended. The CO\nmaxima do not appear to correspond to regions where there is peak massive star\nformation as probed by Halpha emission. The presence of molecular gas is a\nnecessary but not sufficient condition for star formation. Compared to the disk\ngas, the molecular fraction of the extraplanar gas is 30% lower and the star\nformation efficiency of the extraplanar gas is about 3 times lower. The\ncomparison with an existing dynamical model extended by a recipe for\ndistinguishing between atomic and molecular gas shows that a significant part\nof the gas is stripped in the form of overdense arm-like structures. It is\nargued that the molecular fraction depends on the square root of the total\nlarge-scale density.

As the\nsimulations depend on assumptions made for hadronic particle production at\nenergies and phase space regions not accessible in accelerator experiments, the\nderived cross sections are subject to significant systematic uncertainties. The\nfocus of this work is the development of an improved analysis technique that\nallows a significant reduction of the model dependence of the derived cross\nsection at very high energy. Performing a detailed Monte Carlo study of the\npotential and the limitations of different measurement methods, we quantify the\ndependence of the measured cross section on the used hadronic interaction\nmodel. Based on these results, a general improvement to the analysis methods is\nproposed by introducing the actually derived cross section already in the\nsimulation of reference showers. The reduction of the model dependence is\ndemonstrated for one of the measurement methods. \n\n"}

An automatic and objective approach\nconsists in fitting the data using a generalised least-squares method, where\nthe function to be minimized is defined to handle asymmetrically the data at\nboth sides of the boundary. In order to minimise the cost function, a numerical\napproach, based on the popular downhill simplex method, is employed. The\nprocedure is valid for any numerically computable function. Simple polynomials\nprovide good boundaries in common situations. For data exhibiting a complex\nbehaviour, the use of adaptive splines gives excellent results. Since the\ndescribed method is sensitive to extreme data points, the simultaneous\nintroduction of error weighting and the flexibility of allowing some points to\nfall outside of the fitted frontier, supplies the parameters that help to tune\nthe boundary fitting depending on the nature of the considered problem. Two\nsimple examples are presented, namely the estimation of spectra\npseudo-continuum and the segregation of scattered data into ranges. The\nnormalisation of the data ranges prior to the fitting computation typically\nreduces both the numerical errors and the number of iterations required during\nthe iterative minimisation procedure. \n\n"}

However, in\ncalculating the afterglows, usually only the emission from the forward jet is\nconsidered. Here we present a detailed numerical study on the afterglow from\nthe receding jet. Our calculation is based on a generic dynamical description,\nand includes some delicate ingredients such as the effect of the equal arrival\ntime surface. It is found that the emission from the receding jet is generally\nrather weak. In radio bands, it usually peaks at a time of $t \\geq 1000$ d,\nwith the peak flux nearly 4 orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux of the\nforward jet. Also, it usually manifests as a short plateau in the total\nafterglow light curve, but not as an obvious rebrightening as once expected. In\noptical bands, the contribution from the receding jet is even weaker, with the\npeak flux being $\\sim 8$ orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux of the\nforward jet. We thus argue that the emission from the receding jet is very\ndifficult to detect. However, in some special cases, i.e., when the\ncircum-burst medium density is very high, or if the parameters of the receding\njet is quite different from those of the forward jet, the emission from the\nreceding jet can be significantly enhanced and may still emerge as a marked\nrebrightening. We suggest that the search for receding jet emission should\nmostly concentrate on nearby gamma-ray bursts, and the observation campaign\nshould last for at least several hundred days for each event. \n\n"}

Abstract: Type II-linear supernovae are thought to arise from progenitors that have\nlost most of their H envelope by the time of the explosion, and they are poorly\nunderstood because they are only occasionally discovered. It is possible that\nthey are intrinsically rare, but selection effects due to their rapid\nluminosity evolution may also play an important role in limiting the number of\ndetections. In this context, the discovery of a subluminous type II-linear\nevent is even more interesting. We investigate the physical properties and\ncharacterise the explosion site of the type II SN 1999ga, which exploded in the\nnearby spiral galaxy NGC 2442. Spectroscopic and photometric observations of SN\n1999ga allow us to constrain the energetics of the explosion and to estimate\nthe mass of the ejected material, shedding light on the nature of the\nprogenitor star in the final stages of its life. The study of the environment\nin the vicinity of the explosion site provides information on a possible\nrelation between these unusual supernovae and the properties of the galaxies\nhosting them.

This is the most important energy range for absorbing $\\g$-rays from\ndistant sources such as blazars and gamma-ray bursts and producing electron\npositron pairs. In previous work we presented EBL models in the optical through\nultraviolet by consistently taking into account the star formation rate (SFR),\ninitial mass function (IMF) and dust extinction, and treating stars on the main\nsequence as blackbodies. This technique is extended to include post-main\nsequence stars and reprocessing of starlight by dust. In our simple model, the\ntotal energy absorbed by dust is assumed to be re-emitted as three blackbodies\nin the infrared, one at 40 K representing warm, large dust grains, one at 70 K\nrepresenting hot, small dust grains, and one at 450 K representing polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons.

Model results point to ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs)\nfrom supermassive black holes at about the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) energy\nthreshold from low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), and to high-energy\nphoton emissions from stellar mass black holes in ultra-relativistic capillary\njets.

Assuming extragalactic\norigin of this component, we argue that it must disappear at higher energies\ndue to a low maximum energy of acceleration, E_p^{\\max} \\sim (4 - 10) EeV.\nUnder an assumption of rigidity acceleration mechanism, the maximum\nacceleration energy for a nucleus with the charge number Z is ZE_p^{\\max}, and\nthe highest energy in the spectrum, reached by Iron, does not exceed (100 -\n200) EeV.

The design target for such\ninstruments calls for improved sensitivity at low frequencies, specifically in\nthe ~ 1-10 Hz range. This will allow the detection of gravitational waves\ngenerated in binary systems containing black holes of intermediate mass, ~\n100-1000 solar masses. We primarily discuss two different source types --\nmergers between two intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) of comparable mass,\nand intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of smaller compact objects with\nmass ~ 1-10 solar masses into IMBHs. IMBHs may form via two channels: (i) in\ndark matter halos at high redshift through direct collapse or the collapse of\nvery massive metal-poor Population III stars, or (ii) via runaway stellar\ncollisions in globular clusters. In this paper, we will discuss both formation\nchannels, and both classes of merger in each case.

In order to set up a\nstraw-man ultra-compact object with no event horizon, but which is otherwise\nalmost identical to a black hole, we consider a nonrotating thin-shell model\ninspired by Mazur and Mottola's gravastar, which has a Schwarzschild exterior,\na de Sitter interior and an infinitely thin shell with finite tension\nseparating the two regions. As viewed from the external space-time, the shell\ncan be located arbitrarily close to the Schwarzschild radius, so a gravastar\nmight seem indistinguishable from a black hole when tests are only performed on\nits external metric.

We investigate\nthe evolution of this outburst with two-dimensional axisymmetric gasdynamical\ncalculations in which the cavities are inflated by relativistic cosmic rays.\nMany key observational features of the cavities and associated shocks are\nsuccessfully reproduced. The radial elongation of the cavities indicates that\ncosmic rays were injected into the cluster gas by a (jet) source moving out\nfrom the central AGN. AGN jets of this magnitude must be almost perfectly\nidentically bipolar. The relativistic momentum of a single jet would cause a\ncentral AGN black hole of mass 10^9 M_{sun} to recoil at ~6000 km s^{-1},\nexceeding kick velocities during black hole mergers, and be ejected from the\ncluster-center galaxy. When the cavity inflation is complete, 4PV\nunderestimates the total energy received by the cluster gas. Deviations of the\ncluster gas from hydrostatic equilibrium are most pronounced during the early\ncavity evolution when the integrated cluster mass found from the observed gas\npressure gradient can have systematic errors near the cavities of ~10-30%.

The\ntechnical reason for this effect to occur is the property of Bogolubov's\ncoefficients which mix the positive and negative frequencies modes. The\ncorresponding mixture can not be avoided because the projections to positive\n-frequency modes with respect to Minkowski time t and positive -frequency modes\nwith respect to the Rindler observer's proper time \\eta are not equivalent. The\nexact cancellation of unphysical degrees of freedom which is maintained in\nMinkowski space can not hold in the Rindler space.

These moonlets should migrate, due to their gravitational interaction\nwith the ring ; in fact, some orbital variation have been detected. The\nstandard theory of type I migration of planets in protoplanetary disks can't be\napplied to the ring system, as it is pressureless. Thus, we compute the\ndifferential torque felt by a moonlet embedded in a two-dimensional disk of\nsolid particles, with flat surface density profile, both analytically and\nnumerically. We find that the corresponding migration rate is too small to\nexplain the observed variations of the propeller's orbit in Saturn's A-ring.\n  However, local density fluctuations (due to gravity wakes in the marginally\ngravitationally stable A-ring) may exert a stochastic torque on a moonlet. Our\nsimulations show that this torque can be large enough to account for the\nobservations, depending on the parameters of the rings. We find that on time\nscales of several years the migration of propellers is likely to be dominated\nby stochastic effects (while the former, non-stochastic migration dominates\nafter ~ 10^{4-5} years). In that case, the migration rates provided by\nobservations so far suggests that the surface density of the A ring should be\nof the order of 700 kg/m^2. The age of the propellers shouldn't exceed 1 to 100\nmillion years, depending on the dominant migration regime. \n\n"}

In particular we discuss how studying the energy spectra\nof each neutrino flavour coming from such distant sources and their distortion\nrelative to each other may serve as pointers to exotic physics such as neutrino\ndecay, Lorentz symmetry violation, pseudo-Dirac effects, CP and CPT violation\nand quantum decoherence. This allows us to probe hitherto unexplored ranges of\nparameters for the above cases, for example lifetimes in the range $\n10^{-3}-10^{4} $ s/eV for the case of neutrino decay. We show that standard\nneutrino oscillations ensure that the different flavours arrive at the earth\nwith similar shapes even if their flavour spectra at source may differ strongly\nin both shape and magnitude. As a result, observed differences between the\nspectra of various flavours at the detector would be signatures of non-standard\nphysics altering neutrino fluxes during propagation rather than those arising\nduring their production at source. Since detection of ultra-high energy (UHE)\nneutrinos is perhaps imminent, it is possible that such differences in spectral\nshapes will be tested in neutrino detectors in the near future.

In the collapsar\nmodel for LGRBs, gamma rays are produced in an ultrarelativistic jet launching\nfrom the magnetosphere of the black hole that forms in the aftermath of the\ncollapse of a rotating progenitor star. The jet is collimated along the star's\nrotation axis, but the concomitant luminous supernova should be\nrelatively--though certainly not entirely--spherical, and should synthesize a\nsubstantial mass of 56Ni. Our goal is to provide a qualitative assessment of\nthe possibility that accretion of the progenitor envelope onto the black hole,\nwhich powers the LGRB, could also deposit sufficient energy and nickel mass in\nthe envelope to produce a luminous supernova. For this, the energy dissipated\nnear the black hole during accretion must be transported outward, where it can\ndrive a supernova-like shockwave. Here we suggest that the energy is\ntransported by convection and develop an analytical toy model, relying on\nglobal mass and energy conservation, for the dynamics of stellar collapse. The\nmodel suggests that a ~10,000 km/s shock can be driven into the envelope and\nthat ~10^51 erg explosions are possible. The efficiency with which the\naccretion energy is being transferred to the envelope is governed by the\ncompetition of advection and convection at distances ~100-1,000 km from the\nblack hole and is sensitive to the values of the convective mixing length, the\nmagnitude of the effective viscous stress, and the specific angular momentum of\nthe infalling envelope. Substantial masses of 56Ni may be synthesized in the\nconvective accretion flow over the course of tens of seconds from the initial\ncircularization of the infalling envelope around the black hole. The\nsynthesized nickel is convectively mixed with a much larger mass of unburned\nejecta. \n\n"}

In the geophysical community, the\nHeld-Suarez test is a standard benchmark for comparing dynamical core\nsimulations of the Earth's atmosphere with different solvers, based on\nstatistically-averaged flow quantities. In the present study, we perform\nanalogues of the Held-Suarez test for tidally-locked exoplanets with the\nGFDL-Princeton Flexible Modeling System (FMS) by subjecting both the spectral\nand finite difference dynamical cores to a suite of tests, including the\nstandard benchmark for Earth, a hypothetical tidally-locked Earth, a \"shallow\"\nhot Jupiter model and a \"deep\" model of HD 209458b. We find qualitative and\nquantitative agreement between the solvers for the Earth, tidally-locked Earth\nand shallow hot Jupiter benchmarks, but the agreement is less than satisfactory\nfor the deep model of HD 209458b.

In anticipation of the first detections, the\nexpected distribution of GW sources in the local universe is of considerable\ninterest. Here we investigate the full phase space distribution of coalescing\ncompact binaries at $z = 0$ using dark matter simulations of structure\nformation. The fact that these binary systems acquire large barycentric\nvelocities at birth (\"kicks\") results in merger site distributions that are\nmore diffusely distributed with respect to their putative hosts, with mergers\noccurring out to distances of a few Mpc from the host halo.

The magnetic-energy fraction can reach $epsilon_B \\sim$ 0.1\nbut depends on the initial magnetic field strength. We find that the magnetic\nenergy grows by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the magnetic\nenergy immediately behind the shock. This minimum degree of the amplification\ndoes not depend on the amplitude of the initial density fluctuations, while the\ngrowth timescale and the maximum magnetic energy depend on the degree of\ninhomogeneity in the density.

In some well-known analytic models, developed in the 1980s,\nthe B_phi profile was taken to be proportional to the relative angular velocity\nbetween the disc plasma and the neutron star, multiplied by a vertical dipolar\nfield.

In this thesis,\nwe argue however that these signals are plagued by irreducible astrophysical\nbackgrounds and show how plausible conventional physics can mimic the alleged\ndark matter signals. In particular, we consider the possibility that the rise\nin the positron fraction observed by the PAMELA satellite is due to the\nproduction through (hadronic) cosmic ray spallation and subsequent acceleration\nof positrons, in the same sources as the primary cosmic rays. We present a new\nanalytical estimate of the range of possible fluctuations in the high energy\nelectron flux due to the discreteness of plausible cosmic ray sources. Fitting\nour result for the total electron-positron flux measured by the Fermi satellite\nallows us to fix the only free parameter of the model and make an independent\nprediction for the positron fraction. This model can be tested by considering\nsimilar effects expected for nuclear secondary-to-primary ratios such as B/C. A\nrise predicted above O(100) GeV/n would be an unique confirmation of our\nexplanation for a rising positron fraction and rule out the dark matter\nexplanation.

We argue\nthat the energy-dependence of their diffusion makes the extraction of the haze\nthrough template fitting unreliable.

In the first, we test PiMC^2 using simulated SEDs to not only confirm\nthe recovery of the known inputs but to assess the limitations of the method\nand identify potential hazards of SED fitting when applied specifically to high\nredshift (z>4) galaxies. Our tests reveal five critical results: 1) the ability\nto confidently constrain metallicity, population ages, and Av all require\nphotometric accuracy better than what is currently achievable (i.e. less than a\nfew percent); 2) the ability to confidently constrain stellar masses (within a\nfactor of two) can be achieved without the need for high-precision photometry;\n3) the addition of IRAC photometry does not guarantee that tighter constraints\nof the stellar masses and ages can be defined; 4) different assumptions about\nthe star formation history can lead to significant biases in mass and age\nestimates; and 5) we are able to constrain stellar age and Av of objects that\nare both young and relatively dust free.

We model the detailed physics of these\nfast accretion shocks, and apply these to a simple 1-D spherical hydrodynamic\naccretion model for baryonic infall in dark matter halos with an Einasto\ndensity distribution. The escape of UV photons from these halos is delayed by\nthe time taken to reach the critical accretion shock velocity for escape of UV\nphotons; 220 km s$^{-1}$, and by the time it takes for these photons to ionize\nthe surrounding baryonic matter in the accretion flow. Assuming that in the\nuniverse at large the baryonic matter tracks the dark matter, we can estimate\nthe epoch of re-ionization in the case that accretion shocks act alone as the\nsource of UV photons. We find that 50% of the volume (and 5-8% of the mass) of\nthe universe can be ionized by $z \\sim 7-8$. The UV production rate has an\nuncertainty of a factor of about 5 due to uncertainties in the cosmological\nparameters controlling the development of large scale structure.

In this\nmodel, the GRB jet interacts with the circum-stellar medium and drives a shock\nthat heats the medium, which radiates via synchrotron emission. In this work,\nwe carried out a detailed analysis of the late time afterglow data of GRB\n090902B using a very careful accounting of the Inverse Compton losses. We find\nthat in the context of the external forward shock model, the only viable option\nto explain the X-ray and optical data of GRB 090920B is to have the electron\nenergy distribution deviate from a power-law shape and exhibit some slight\ncurvature immediately downstream of the shock front (we explored other models\nthat rely on a single power-law assumption, but they all fail to explain the\nobservations). We find the fraction of the energy of shocked plasma in magnetic\nfield to be ~10^{-6} using late time afterglow data, which is consistent with\nthe value obtained using early gamma-ray data. Studies like the present one\nmight be able to provide a link between GRB afterglow modeling and numerical\nsimulations of particle acceleration in collisionless shocks. We also provide\ndetailed calculations for the early (< 10^3 s) high energy (> 100 MeV) emission\nand confirm that it is consistent with origin in the external forward shock.

We detect a ~1 mJy source at 1.43, 4.86, 8.46 and 22.5 GHz,\nmaking it the most luminous radio emission over the widest frequency range\ndetected from an ultracool dwarf to date. A 10 hr VLA observation reveals that\nthe radio emission varies sinusoidally with a period of 3.89+/-0.05 hr, and an\namplitude of ~30% at 4.86 GHz and ~20% at 8.46 GHz. The periodicity is also\nseen in circular polarization, where at 4.86 GHz the polarization reverses\nhelicity from left- to right-handed in phase with the total intensity. An\narchival detection in the FIRST survey indicates that the radio emission has\nbeen stable for at least a decade. We also detect periodic photometric\nvariability in several optical filters with a period of 3.79 hr, and measure a\nrotation velocity of vsini=45+/-5 km/s, in good agreement with the radio and\noptical periods. The period and rotation velocity allow us to place a lower\nlimit on the radius of the source of >0.12 R_sun, about 30% larger than\ntheoretical expectations. The properties of the radio emission can be explained\nwith a simple model of a magnetic dipole mis-aligned relative to the stellar\nrotation axis, with the sinusoidal variations and helicity reversal due to the\nrotation of the magnetic poles relative to our line of sight. The long-term\nstability of the radio emission indicates that the magnetic field (and hence\nthe dynamo) is stable on a much longer timescale than the convective turn-over\ntime of ~0.2 yr. If the radio emission is due to the electron cyclotron maser\nprocess, the inferred magnetic field strength reaches at least 8 kG. \n\n"}

A possible correlation between the\nmass of SMBHs and the evolutionary state of their host galaxies is expected.\nBased on the recent 2D decomposition of mid-infrared Spiter/IRAC images of\nlocal galaxies with M_bh measurements, we investigated various scaling laws,\nstudying what the best predictor of the mass of the central SMBHs is. We\nfocused on the M_bh-M_G sigma^2 law, the relation between the mass of SMBHs and\nthe kinetic energy of random motions of the corresponding host galaxies. In\norder to find the best fit for each of the scaling laws examined, we performed\na least-squares regression of M_bh on x for the considered sample of galaxies,\nx being a whatever known parameter of the galaxy bulge. Our analysis shows that\nM_bh-M_G sigma^2 law fits the examined experimental data successfully as much\nas the other known scaling laws and shows a value of chi^2 better than the\nothers, a result which is consistent with previous determinations. This means\nthat a combination of sigma and M_G could be necessary to drive the\ncorrelations between M_bh and other bulge properties. This issue has been\ninvestigated by a careful analysis of the residuals of the various relations.\nIn order to avoid rushed conclusions on galaxy activity and evolution, the\nindirect inferring of M_bh from the kinetic energy of random motions should be\nconsidered, especially when applied to higher redshift galaxies. This statement\nis suggested by a reanalysis of the SDSS data used to study the SMBH growth in\nthe nearby Universe. Adopting the M_bh-M_G sigma^2 relation instead of the\nM_bh-sigma, a radio-quiet/radio-loud dichotomy appears in the SMBH mass\ndistribution of the corresponding SDSS early-type AGN galaxies. \n\n"}
{"id": "1110.4038", "contents": "Title: Estimating the redshift of PKS 0447-439 through its GeV-TeV emission Abstract: Context. Blazars are radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a jet\npointing at small angles towards the observer. The overall emitted spectrum is\ntypically non-thermal, and in some cases the emission and/or absorption lines\nare so faint as to prevent the determination of the redshift based on optical\nspectroscopy methods. PKS 0447-439 is a bright blazar recently detected at very\nhigh energy. The redshift of the source is still disputed: a recent spectral\nanalysis reports only a lower limit of z > 1.246, which contradicts the\nprevious measure of z = 0.205 reported in the literature. Aims. We aim to give\na redshift estimate of the blazar PKS 0447-439 based on combined GeV\n(Fermi/LAT) and TeV (H.E.S.S.) observations. Methods. Taking into account the\nabsorption of TeV photons by the interaction with the extragalactic background\nlight (EBL), we applied the method we developed in a previous work to derive\nthe redshift of PKS 0447-439. Moreover, we compiled the overall spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) using optical-UV, soft X-ray, and -ray data, nearly\nsimultaneous to the H.E.S.S. observations at TeV energies. Finally we modelled\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED) within the framework of a homogeneous,\nleptonic synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. Results. Using the recent TeV\nspectrum measured by H.E.S.S. we obtain for PKS 0447-439 a redshift of zrec =\n0.20 \\pm 0.05, which is our estimate on the source distance. This value agrees\nvery well with the value reported in the literature and confirms that our\nmethod can be successfully used to constrain blazars distances. Assuming this\ndistance, the SED can be well fitted with the above mentioned model. The\nphysical parameters that we find suggest a strongly matter-dominated jet.\nConclusions. Our analysis confirms that the redshift of PKS 0447-439 is likely\n0.2, and supports the result present in the literature. \n\n"}

Abstract: We analyze several data sets obtained by Hinode/EIS and find various types of\nflows during CMEs and EUV jet eruptions. CME-induced dimming regions are found\nto be characterized by significant blueshift and enhanced line width by using a\nsingle Gaussian fit. While a red-blue (RB) asymmetry analysis and a RB-guided\ndouble Gaussian fit of the coronal line profiles indicate that these are likely\ncaused by the superposition of a strong background emission component and a\nrelatively weak (~10%) high-speed (~100 km s-1) upflow component. This finding\nsuggests that the outflow velocity in the dimming region is probably of the\norder of 100 km s-1, not ~20 km s-1 as reported previously. Density and\ntemperature diagnostics suggest that dimming is primarily an effect of density\ndecrease rather than temperature change. The mass losses in dimming regions as\nestimated from different methods are roughly consistent with each other and\nthey are 20%-60% of the masses of the associated CMEs. With the guide of RB\nasymmetry analysis, we also find several temperature-dependent outflows (speed\nincreases with temperature) immediately outside the (deepest) dimming region.\nIn an erupted CME loop and an EUV jet, profiles of emission lines formed at\ncoronal and transition region temperatures are found to exhibit two\nwell-separated components, an almost stationary component accounting for the\nbackground emission and a highly blueshifted (~200 km s-1) component\nrepresenting emission from the erupting material. The two components can easily\nbe decomposed through a double Gaussian fit and we can diagnose the electron\ndensity, temperature and mass of the ejecta.

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio. This method in principle can also be applied to any accreting\ncompact objects with detectable accretion disk wind absorption line features. \n\n"}

Some typical patterns of U_0 are\nreexamined by constraining their respective perturbations with current\nexperimental data. We illustrate a few possible ways to minimally correct U_0\nin order to fit the observed values of three mixing angles. We point out that\nthe structure of U may exhibit an approximate \\mu-\\tau permutation symmetry in\nmodulus, and reiterate the geometrical description of CP violation in terms of\nthe leptonic unitarity triangles. The salient features of nine distinct\nparametrizations of U are summarized, and its Wolfenstein-like expansion is\npresented by taking U_0 to be the democratic mixing pattern. \n\n"}

High-contrast imaging is currently the only available technique for\nthe study of the thermodynamical and compositional properties of exoplanets in\nlong-period orbits. The SPICES project is a coronagraphic space telescope\ndedicated to the spectro-polarimetric analysis of gaseous and icy giant planets\nas well as super-Earths at visible wavelengths. So far, studies for\nhigh-contrast imaging instruments have mainly focused on technical feasibility\nbecause of the challenging planet/star flux ratio of 10-8-10-10 required at\nshort separations (200 mas or so) to image cold exoplanets.

For benchmark model\nparameters (e.g. the bulk Lorentz factor is \\Gamma=10^{2.5}, the observed\nvariability time for long GRBs is t_v=0.01 s and the ratio between the energy\nin accelerated protons and in radiation is \\eta_p=10 for every burst) in the\nstandard internal shock scenario, the predicted neutrino flux from 215 bursts\nduring the period of the 40-string and 59-string configurations is found to be\na factor of ~3 below the IceCube sensitivity. However, if we accept the\nrecently found inherent relation between the bulk Lorentz factor and burst\nenergy, the expected neutrino flux increases significantly and the spectral\npeak shifts to lower energy. In this case, the non-detection then implies that\nthe baryon loading ratio should be \\eta_p<10 if the variability time of long\nGRBs is fixed to t_v=0.01 s.

The reason is that stellar winds have\nbeen found to be clumped, which results in the reduction of unclumped empirical\nmass-loss rates. Most stellar evolution models employ theoretical mass-loss\nrates which are already reduced by a moderate factor of ~2-3 compared to\nnon-corrected empirical rates. A key question is whether these reduced rates\nare of the correct order of magnitude, or if they should be reduced even\nfurther, which would mean that the alternative of eruptive mass loss becomes\nnecessary. Here we introduce the transition mass-loss rate (dM/dt)_trans\nbetween O and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Its novelty is that it is model\nindependent. All that is required is postulating the spectroscopic transition\npoint in a given data-set, and determining the stellar luminosity, which is far\nless model dependent than the mass-loss rate. The transition mass-loss rate is\nsubsequently used to calibrate stellar wind strength by its application to the\nOf/WNh stars in the Arches cluster. Good agreement is found with two\nalternative modelling/theoretical results, suggesting that the rates provided\nby current theoretical models are of the right order of magnitude in the\n~50Msun mass range. Our results do not confirm the specific need for eruptive\nmass loss as Luminous Blue Variables, and current stellar evolution modelling\nfor Galactic massive stars seems sound.

In this paper, we focus on Bayesian data classification algorithms\nusing the Gaussian mixture model and show two applications in pulsar astronomy.\nAfter reviewing the Gaussian mixture model and the related\nExpectation-Maximization algorithm, we present a data classification method\nusing the Neyman-Pearson test. To demonstrate the method, we apply the\nalgorithm to two classification problems. Firstly, it is applied to the well\nknown period-period derivative diagram, where we find that the pulsar\ndistribution can be modeled with six Gaussian clusters, with two clusters for\nmillisecond pulsars (recycled pulsars) and the rest for normal pulsars. From\nthis distribution, we derive an empirical definition for millisecond pulsars as\n$\\frac{\\dot{P}}{10^{-17}} \\leq3.23(\\frac{P}{100 \\textrm{ms}})^{-2.34}$. The two\nmillisecond pulsar clusters may have different evolutionary origins, since the\ncompanion stars to these pulsars in the two clusters show different chemical\ncomposition. Four clusters are found for normal pulsars. Possible implications\nfor these clusters are also discussed. Our second example is to calculate the\nlikelihood of unidentified \\textit{Fermi} point sources being pulsars and rank\nthem accordingly. In the ranked point source list, the top 5% sources contain\n50% known pulsars, the top 50% contain 99% known pulsars, and no known active\ngalaxy (the other major population) appears in the top 6%.

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM. The galaxies with more turbulent ISM, yet still\ncharacterised by very weak turbulence, can hold larger amounts of the ICM.\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

This physics leads to accretion disc models that exhibit\nbistability and thermal limit cycles, whereby the disc jumps between a family\nof cool and low accreting states and a family of hot and efficiently accreting\nstates.

Data from cosmic ray observatories\nare yet inconclusive about their exact location or distribution, but provide a\nmeasure for the average local density of these emitters. Due to the\ndiscreteness of the emitters the flux and nuclear composition is expected to\nshow ensemble fluctuations on top of the statistical variations, i.e. \"cosmic\nvariance\". This effect is strongest for the most energetic cosmic rays due to\nthe limited propagation distance in the cosmic radiation background and is\nhence a local phenomenon. For the statistical analysis of cosmic ray emission\nmodels it is important to quantify the possible level of this variance.

Only two\ncurrent observational methods of determining the mass profile, gravitational\nlensing and the caustic technique, are independent of the assumption of\ndynamical equilibrium. Both techniques enable determination of the extended\nmass profile at radii beyond the virial radius. For 19 clusters, we compare the\nmass profile based on the caustic technique with weak lensing measurements\ntaken from the literature. This comparison offers a test of systematic issues\nin both techniques. Around the virial radius, the two methods of mass\nestimation agree to within about 30%, consistent with the expected errors in\nthe individual techniques. At small radii, the caustic technique overestimates\nthe mass as expected from numerical simulations. The ratio between the lensing\nprofile and the caustic mass profile at these radii suggests that the weak\nlensing profiles are a good representation of the true mass profile. At radii\nlarger than the virial radius, the lensing mass profile exceeds the caustic\nmass profile possibly as a result of contamination of the lensing profile by\nlarge-scale structures within the lensing kernel.

Broad band spectral analysis Abstract: (Abridged) The simultaneous UV to X-rays/gamma rays data obtained during the\nmulti-wavelength XMM/INTEGRAL campaign on the Seyfert 1 Mrk 509 are used in\nthis paper and tested against physically motivated broad band models. Each\nobservation has been fitted with a realistic thermal comptonisation model for\nthe continuum emission. Prompted by the correlation between the UV and soft\nX-ray flux, we use a thermal comptonisation component for the soft X-ray\nexcess. The UV to X-rays/gamma-rays emission of Mrk 509 can be well fitted by\nthese components. The presence of a relatively hard high-energy spectrum points\nto the existence of a hot (kT~100 keV), optically-thin (tau~0.5) corona\nproducing the primary continuum. On the contrary, the soft X-ray component\nrequires a warm (kT~1 keV), optically-thick (tau~15) plasma. Estimates of the\namplification ratio for this warm plasma support a configuration close to the\n\"theoretical\" configuration of a slab corona above a passive disk. An\ninteresting consequence is the weak luminosity-dependence of its emission, a\npossible explanation of the roughly constant spectral shape of the soft X-ray\nexcess seen in AGNs. The temperature (~ 3 eV) and flux of the soft-photon field\nentering and cooling the warm plasma suggests that it covers the accretion disk\ndown to a transition radius $R_{tr}$ of 10-20 $R_g$. This plasma could be the\nwarm upper layer of the accretion disk. On the contrary the hot corona has a\nmore photon-starved geometry. The high temperature ($\\sim$ 100 eV) of the\nsoft-photon field entering and cooling it favors a localization of the hot\ncorona in the inner flow. This soft-photon field could be part of the\ncomptonised emission produced by the warm plasma.

This in turn implies that the X-ray luminosity should saturate and even\ndecrease for optically thick winds with very high mass-loss rates. In the\nopposite limit of adiabatic shocks in low-density winds (e.g., from B-stars),\nthe X-ray luminosity should drop steeply with Mdot^2.

But if disks are\nturbulent, this neglects a spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations that can\nproduce rare, high-density mass concentrations. Here, we use a\nrecently-developed analytic framework to predict the statistics of these\nfluctuations, i.e. the rate of fragmentation and mass spectrum of fragments\nformed in a turbulent Keplerian disk. Turbulent disks are never completely\nstable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of forming\nself-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations in\nsuch disks. Modest sub-sonic turbulence above Mach number ~0.1 can produce a\nfew stochastic fragmentation or 'direct collapse' events over ~Myr timescales,\neven if Q>>1 and cooling is slow (t_cool>>t_orbit). In trans-sonic turbulence\nthis extends to Q~100. We derive the true Q-criterion needed to suppress such\nevents, which scales exponentially with Mach number. We specify to turbulence\ndriven by MRI, convection, or spiral waves, and derive equivalent criteria in\nterms of Q and the cooling time. Cooling times >~50*t_dyn may be required to\ncompletely suppress fragmentation. These gravoturbulent events produce mass\nspectra peaked near ~M_disk*(Q*M_disk/M_star)^2 (rocky-to-giant planet masses,\nincreasing with distance from the star). We apply this to protoplanetary disk\nmodels and show that even minimum mass solar nebulae could experience\nstochastic collapse events, provided a source of turbulence. \n\n"}

For the centroid of the\ncyclotron line, the photon index and the flux of the 6.4 keV iron line, we have\nstudied the variation as a function of 35 d phase. We analyzed RXTE\nobservations of the Main-On of November 2002. Four different time intervals of\nabout 1 d duration were selected to provide a good coverage of a complete\nMain-On. The intervals are centered at 35 d phase 0.03, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20,\nrespectively. All spectral parameters show a strong modulation with pulse\nphase. While the centroid energy of the cyclotron line follows roughly the\nshape of the pulse profile, both the photon index and the iron line intensity\nexhibit distinct minima around the peak of the X-ray pulse. With respect to\nvariations of the observed profiles with 35 d phase, we find that there is a\nclear evolution of the shape of the pulse profiles (flux versus pulse phase), a\nmoderate increase of the maximum cyclotron line energy (found around pulse\nphase 0.7), but no significant evolution of the shape of the pulse phase\nprofiles of the cyclotron line energy, the spectral power law index or the iron\nline intensity.

The flow structure is\ngeometrically thick, and independent of the gas density and cooling, if the\ncooling time is longer than the viscous timescale (i.e., $t_{\\rm cool} \\gtrsim\nt_{\\rm visc}$). For higher densities, the gas can cool before it can accrete\nand forms the standard geometrically thin, optically thick Shakura-Sunyaev\ndisk. For usual cooling processes (such as bremsstrahlung), we expect an inner\nhot flow and an outer thin disk. For a short cooling time the accretion flow\nseparates into two phases: a radiatively inefficient hot coronal phase and a\ncold thin disk. We argue that there is an upper limit on the density of the hot\ncorona corresponding to a critical value of $t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff} (\\sim\n10-100)$, the ratio of the cooling time and the free-fall time. Based on our\nsimulations, we have developed a model for transients observed in black hole\nX-ray binaries (XRBs). An XRB in a quiescent hot RIAF state can transition to a\ncold black-body dominated state because of an increase in the mass accretion\nrate. The transition from a thin disk to a RIAF happens because of mass\nexhaustion due to accretion; the transition happens when the cooling time\nbecomes longer than the viscous time at inner radii. Since the viscous\ntimescale for a geometrically thin disk is quite long, the high-soft state is\nexpected to be long-lived. The different timescales in black hole transients\ncorrespond to different physical processes such as viscous evolution, cooling,\nand free-fall. Our model captures the overall features of observed state\ntransitions in XRBs. \n\n"}

Interstellar absorption from excited CH+ in the J=1 level and\nfrom excited CH in the J=3/2 level is also seen. To our knowledge, neither\nthose excited molecular lines nor such strongly extended DIBs have previously\nbeen seen in absorption from interstellar gas. These unusual features appear to\narise in a small region near Herschel 36 which contains most of the neutral\ninterstellar material in the sight line. The CH+ and CH in that region are\nradiatively excited by strong far-IR radiation from the adjacent infrared\nsource Her 36 SE. Similarly, the broadening of the DIBs toward Herschel 36 may\nbe due to radiative pumping of closely spaced high-J rotational levels of\nrelatively small, polar carrier molecules. If this picture of excited\nrotational states for the DIB carriers is correct and applicable to most DIBs,\nthe 2.7 degree cosmic microwave background may set the minimum widths (about\n0.35 A) of known DIBs, with molecular processes and/or local radiation fields\nproducing the larger widths found for the broader DIBs.

Whilst the low\neccentricity of the system favors a white dwarf companion, an unusual double\nneutron star system is also a possibility, and optical observations will be\nable to distinguish between these possibilities. In order to allow the absolute\nluminosity (or upper limit) of the companion object to be properly calibrated,\nwe undertook astrometric observations with the Very Long Baseline Array to\nconstrain the system distance via a measurement of annual geometric parallax.\nWith these observations, we measure the parallax of the J2222-0137 system to be\n3.742 +0.013 -0.016 milliarcseconds, yielding a distance of 267.3 +1.2 -0.9 pc,\nand measure the transverse velocity to be 57.1 +0.3 -0.2 km/s. Fixing these\nparameters in the pulsar timing model made it possible to obtain a measurement\nof Shapiro delay and hence the system inclination, which shows that the system\nis nearly edge-on (sin i = 0.9985 +/- 0.0005). Furthermore, we were able to\ndetect the orbital motion of J2222-0137 in our VLBI observations and measure\nthe longitude of ascending node.

Simulations and test observations demonstrate feasibility Abstract: The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a new low frequency interferomeric\nradio telescope. The MWA is the low frequency precursor to the Square Kilometre\nArray (SKA) and is the first of three SKA precursors to be operational,\nsupporting a varied science mission ranging from the attempted detection of the\nEpoch of Reionisation to the monitoring of solar flares and space weather. We\nexplore the possibility that the MWA can be used for the purposes of Space\nSituational Awareness (SSA). In particular we propose that the MWA can be used\nas an element of a passive radar facility operating in the frequency range 87.5\n- 108 MHz (the commercial FM broadcast band). In this scenario the MWA can be\nconsidered the receiving element in a bi-static radar configuration, with FM\nbroadcast stations serving as non-cooperative transmitters. The FM broadcasts\npropagate into space, are reflected off debris in Earth orbit, and are received\nat the MWA. The imaging capabilities of the MWA can be used to simultaneously\ndetect multiple pieces of space debris, image their positions on the sky as a\nfunction of time, and provide tracking data that can be used to determine\norbital parameters. Such a capability would be a valuable addition to\nAustralian and global SSA assets, in terms of southern and eastern hemispheric\ncoverage.

The\ncause of this low radio detection rate has previously been attributed to\nlimited observing sensitivity. We use visibility stacking to test this idea,\nand conclude that the low detection rate is instead due to two intrinsically\ndifferent populations of GRBs, radio bright and radio faint.

Studies of\nstripped-envelope supernovae, in particular, require binary mass transfer.\nDramatic examples of eruptive mass loss are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which\nhave massive shells ejected just a few years before core collapse.

In\norder to investigate the origin of this enhancement, we have analyzed two\noverlapping XMM-Newton observations of this cloud. We find that the X-ray\nenhancement is $\\sim$6' or $\\sim$100 pc across, and is concentrated to the\nnorth and west of the densest part of the cloud. We modeled the X-ray\nenhancement with a variety of spectral models.

However, this\nmodel underpredicts the on-enhancement emission around 1 keV, which may\nindicate the additional presence of hotter plasma ($T \\gtrsim 10^7$ K), or that\nrecombination emission is important. We examined several different physical\nmodels for the origin of the X-ray enhancement.

In\naddition, shock heating in a cool or warm medium leads to emission that is too\nsoft (for reasonable cloud speeds). We find that magnetic reconnection could\nplausibly power the observed X-ray emission, but resistive\nmagnetohydrodynamical simulations are needed to test this hypothesis.

It consists on a set of calibration curves that\nrelate the surface energy estimator, S(r0), and the depth of maximum\ndevelopment of the shower, Xmax, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes.\nThen, the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since\nS(r0) and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed. Considering\na mixed sample of ultra-high energy proton and iron primaries and taking into\naccount the reconstruction uncertainties and shower to shower fluctuations, we\ndemonstrate that the primary energy may be determined with a systematic\nuncertainty below 1% and resolution around 16% in the energy range from\n10^{18.5} to 10^{19.6} eV.

They\nrepresent a unique probe for high-density matter because the oscillations are\ndetectable via gravitational-wave measurements and are strongly dependent on\nthe equation of state. The impact of the equation of state is apparent in the\nfrequency of the dominant oscillation mode of the remnant. For a fixed total\nbinary mass a tight relation between the dominant postmerger frequency and the\nradii of nonrotating neutron stars exists. Inferring observationally the\ndominant postmerger frequency thus determines neutron star radii with high\naccuracy of the order of a few hundred meters. By considering symmetric and\nasymmetric binaries of the same chirp mass, we show that the knowledge of the\nbinary mass ratio is not critical for this kind of radius measurements. We\nsummarize different possibilities to deduce the maximum mass of nonrotating\nneutron stars. We clarify the nature of the three most prominent features of\nthe postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum and argue that the merger remnant\ncan be considered to be a single, isolated, self-gravitating object that can be\ndescribed by concepts of asteroseismology. The understanding of the different\nmechanisms shaping the gravitational-wave signal yields a physically motivated\nanalytic model of the gravitational-wave emission, which may form the basis for\ntemplate-based gravitational-wave data analysis. We explore the observational\nconsequences of a scenario of two families of compact stars including hadronic\nand quark stars. We find that this scenario leaves a distinctive imprint on the\npostmerger gravitational-wave signal. In particular, a strong discontinuity in\nthe dominant postmerger frequency as function of the total mass will be a\nstrong indication for two families of compact stars. (abridged) \n\n"}

This phenomenon has profound implications for the\ninterpretation of the multifrequency spectra of radiation from supernova\nremnants. Neutrals that undergo charge exchange with hot ions downstream of the\nshock may result in fast neutrals moving towards the upstream gas, where they\ncan suffer additional charge exchange or ionisation reactions, thereby\ndepositing energy and momentum upstream. Here we discuss the implications of\nthis neutral return flux, which was already predicted in our previous work on\nneutral mediated supernova shocks, and show how the spectra of accelerated\nparticles turn out to be appreciably steeper than $p^{-4}$, thereby affecting\nthe gamma ray spectra from supernova remnants in general and from Tycho\nspecifically. The theory that describes non-linear diffusive shock acceleration\nin the presence of neutral hydrogen has been developed in recent years. Here we\nuse a semi-analytical theory developed in previous work and specialise our\npredictions to the case of the Tycho supernova shock, where there is evidence\nthat the spectrum of the accelerated cosmic rays is steeper than expected from\nthe traditional theory of diffusive shock acceleration. We show that, if the\nfraction of neutral hydrogen in the vicinity of the Tycho supernova shock is,\nas suggested by observations, ~70-90, then spectra of accelerated protons\nsteeper than $p^{-4}$ may be a natural consequence of charge exchange reactions\nand the associated neutral return flux. The spectral shape is affected by this\nphenomenon for particles with energies below ~100-1000 GeV, for which the\ndiffusion length is less than or at most comparable to the pathlength of charge\nexchange and ionisation upstream of the shock. \n\n"}

We\nterm these signals \"intermediate-duration\" because they are shorter than\ncontinuous wave signals but longer than signals traditionally considered as\ngravitational wave bursts, and are difficult to detect with most burst and\ncontinuous wave methods. The cross-correlation technique proposed by [S.\nDhurandhar et al., Phys. Rev.

The non-spherical shape of the disk as well as blocking of the\nneutron star by the disk and vice versa cause the observed flux to depend on\nthe inclination angle of the disk with respect to the line of sight. This is of\nspecial importance for the interpretation of Type I X-ray bursts, which are\npowered by the thermonuclear burning of matter accreted onto the neutron star.\nBecause part of the X-ray burst is reflected off the disk, the observed burst\nflux depends on the anisotropies for both direct emission from the neutron star\nand reflection off the disk. This influences measurements of source distance,\nmass accretion rate, and constraints on the neutron star equation of state.\nPrevious studies made predictions of the anisotropy factor for the total burst\nflux, assuming a geometrically flat disk. Recently, detailed observations of\ntwo exceptionally long bursts (so-called superbursts) allowed for the first\ntime for the direct and the reflected burst flux to each be measured, as\nopposed to just their sum. The ratio of the reflected and direct flux (the\nreflection fraction) was much higher than what the anisotropies of a flat disk\ncan account for. We create numerical models to calculate the anisotropy factors\nfor different disk shapes, including concave disks. We present the anisotropy\nfactors of the direct and reflected burst flux separately, as well as the\nanisotropy of the persistent flux. Reflection fractions substantially larger\nthan unity are produced in case the inner accretion disk steeply increases in\nheight, such that part of the star is blocked from view. Such a geometry could\npossibly be induced by the X-ray burst, if X-ray heating causes the inner disk\nto puff up. \n\n"}

Stability of new fermion or scalar multiplets is\nensured by an accidental matter parity that survives the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of the gauge group by scalar triplets. The relic abundance of these\nparticles is set by gauge interactions and gives rise to dark matter candidates\nwith masses above the electroweak scale. Dark matter annihilations are thus\nmodified by the Sommerfeld effect, not only in the early Universe, but also\ntoday, for instance, in the Center of the Galaxy. Majorana candidates -\ntriplet, quintuplet, bi-doublet, and bi-triplet - bring only one new parameter\nto the model, their mass, and are hence highly testable at colliders and\nthrough astrophysical observations. Scalar candidates - doublet and 7-plet, the\nlatter being only stable at the renormalizable level - have additional\nscalar-scalar interactions that give rise to rich phenomenology. The particles\nunder discussion share many features with the well-known candidates wino,\nHiggsino, inert doublet scalar, sneutrino, and Minimal Dark Matter. In\nparticular, they all predict a large gamma-ray flux from dark matter\nannihilations, which can be searched for with Cherenkov telescopes.

We find\nthat the accretion rate of BHs embedded in bulges is proportional to\nr_{B,eff}/r_B, where r_{B,eff} is the increased effective Bondi radius that\nincludes the gravitational potential of the bulge, and r_B is the Bondi radius\nof the BH. The radiative feedback from the BH suppresses the cold accretion\nrate to ~1 percent of the Bondi rate when a bulge is not considered. However,\nwe find that the BH fueling rate increases rapidly when the bulge mass M_bulge\nis greater than the critical value of 10^6 M_sun and is proportional to\nM_bulge. Since the critical bulge mass is independent of the central BH mass\nM_{BH}, the growth rate of BHs with masses of 10^2, 10^4, and 10^6 M_sun\nexhibits distinct dependencies on the bulge-to-BH mass ratio. Our results imply\nthat light seed BHs (<= 10^2 M_sun) which might be the remnants of the Pop III\nstars, cannot grow through accretion coevally with the early assembly of the\nbulge of the host galaxies until the bulge reaches the critical mass.

However, measuring the signal is technically challenging: one must\nextract a small, frequency-dependent signal from under much brighter spectrally\nsmooth foregrounds. Traditional approaches to study the global signal have used\nsingle antennas, which require one to calibrate out the frequency-dependent\nstructure in the overall system gain (due to internal reflections, for example)\nas well as remove the noise bias from auto-correlating a single amplifier\noutput. This has motivated proposals to measure the signal using\ncross-correlations in interferometric setups, where additional calibration\ntechniques are available. In this paper we focus on the general principles\ndriving the sensitivity of the interferometric setups to the global signal. We\nprove that this sensitivity is directly related to two characteristics of the\nsetup: the cross-talk between readout channels (i.e. the signal picked up at\none antenna when the other one is driven) and the correlated noise due to\nthermal fluctuations of lossy elements (e.g. absorbers or the ground) radiating\ninto both channels. Thus in an interferometric setup, one cannot suppress\ncross-talk and correlated thermal noise without reducing sensitivity to the\nglobal signal by the same factor -- instead, the challenge is to characterize\nthese effects and their frequency dependence.

The agents responsible for mediating the MONDian force law are\nsuperfluid phonons that couple to ordinary (baryonic) matter. In this paper we\npropose an alternative way for the MOND phenomenon to emerge from DM\nsuperfluidity. The central idea is to use higher-gradient corrections in the\nsuperfluid effective theory. These next-to-leading order terms involve\ngradients of the gravitational potential, and therefore effectively modify the\ngravitational force law. In the process we discover a novel mechanism for\ngenerating the non-relativistic MOND action, starting from a theory that is\nfully analytic in all field variables. The idea, inspired by the symmetron\nmechanism, uses the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. For large\nacceleration, the symmetry is unbroken and the action reduces to Einstein\ngravity. For small acceleration, the symmetry is spontaneously broken and the\naction reduces to MONDian gravity.

Using existing radio\nsource catalogs we have searched all the daily VLITE images for transients,\nwhile for the COSMOS field we compared individual images and the summed image\nto search for new sources in repeated observations of the same field. The wide\nrange of timescales makes VLITE sensitive to both coherent and incoherent\ntransient source classes.

The azimuthal\nasymmetry is due to a combination of the longitudinal evolution of the shower\nand geometrical effects related to the angles of incidence of the particles\ninto the detectors.

The flavor\nratios for neutrinos and antineutrinos can be quite different as we do not know\nhow they are produced in the astrophysical environment. Due to this uncertainty\nthe neutrino and antineutrino flavor ratios at the Earth also could be quite\ndifferent. Nonetheless, it is generally assumed that flavor ratios for\nneutrinos and antineutrinos are the same at the Earth, in fitting the high\nenergy astrophysical neutrino data. This is a reasonable assumption for the\nlimited statistics for the data we currently have.

By carefully analyzing the standard\narguments based on a Gedankenexperiment in which a black hole is\nseemingly-unable to return the baryon number that it swallowed, we identify\ninconsistencies in this reasoning, which does not take into the account neither\nthe existence of skyrmion black holes nor the baryon/skyrmion correspondence.\nWe then perform a refined Gedankenexperiment by incorporating the new knowledge\nand show that no contradiction with conservation of baryon number takes place\nat any stage of black hole evolution. Our analysis also indicates no conflict\nbetween semi-classical black holes and the existence of baryonic gauge\ninteraction arbitrarily-weaker than gravity. Next, we study classical cross\nsections of a minimally-coupled massless probe scalar field scattered by a\nskyrmion black hole.

In this context, even the\nunlikely idea that astrophysical black holes may have significant charge is\nworth exploring, and here we present results from the simulation of weakly\ncharged black holes as they orbit and merge. Our simulations suggest that a\nblack hole binary with mass comparable to that observed in GW150914 could\nproduce the level of electromagnetic luminosity observed by Fermi GBM\n($10^{49}$ ergs/s) with a non-dimensional charge of $q \\equiv Q/M = 10^{-4}$\nassuming good radiative efficiency.

We investigate the ability of a future UHE neutrino\ndetector to identify the brightest neutrino point sources, by exploring the\nparameter space of the total number of observed events and the angular\nresolution of the detector. The favored parameter region can be translated to\nrequirements for the effective area, sky coverage and angular resolution of\nfuture detectors, for a given source number density and evolution history.\nMoreover, by studying the typical distance to sources that are expected to emit\nmore than one event for a given diffuse neutrino flux, we find that a\nsignificant fraction of the identifiable UHE neutrino sources may be located in\nthe nearby Universe if the source number density is above $\\sim10^{-6}\\,\\rm\nMpc^{-3}$.

The tMSPs have raised\nseveral questions related to the nature of accretion flow in their LMXB state\nand the mechanism that causes the state switch. The discovery of coherent X-ray\npulsations from PSR J1023+0038 (while in the LMXB state) provides us with the\nfirst opportunity to perform timing observations and to compare the neutron\nstar's spin variation during this state to the measured spin-down in the RMSP\nstate. Whereas the X-ray pulsations in the LMXB state likely indicate that some\nmaterial is accreting onto the neutron star's magnetic polar caps, radio\ncontinuum observations indicate the presence of an outflow. The fraction of the\ninflowing material being ejected is not clear, but it may be much larger than\nthat reaching the neutron star's surface. Timing observations can measure the\ntotal torque on the neutron star. We have phase-connected nine XMM-Newton\nobservations of PSR J1023+0038 over the last 2.5 years of the LMXB state to\nestablish a precise measurement of spin evolution. We find that the average\nspin-down rate as an LMXB is 26.8+/-0.4% faster than the rate (-2.39x10^-15 Hz\ns-1) determined during the RMSP state. This shows that negative angular\nmomentum contributions (dipolar magnetic braking and outflow) exceed positive\nones (accreted material), and suggests that the pulsar wind continues to\noperate at a largely unmodified level. We discuss implications of this tight\nobservational constraint in the context of possible accretion models. \n\n"}

By\nbuilding dictionaries from numerical relativity templates of both, binary black\nholes mergers and bursts of rotational core collapse, we show how\nmachine-learning algorithms based on dictionaries can be also successfully\napplied for gravitational wave denoising. We use a subset of signals from both\ncatalogs, embedded in non-white Gaussian noise, to assess our techniques with a\nlarge sample of tests and to find the best model parameters. The application of\nour method to the actual signal GW150914 shows promising results.\nDictionary-learning algorithms could be a complementary addition to the\ngravitational wave data analysis toolkit.

A promising driving mechanism for these outflows\nis mass loss driven by the thermal expansion of X-ray heated material in the\nouter disk atmosphere. Higginbottom \\& Proga recently demonstrated that the\nproperties of thermally-driven winds depend critically on the shape of the\nthermal equilibrium curve, since this determines the thermal stability of the\nirradiated material. For a given spectral energy distribution, the thermal\nequilibrium curve depends on exact balance between the various heating and\ncooling mechanisms at work. Most previous work on thermally-driven disk winds\nrelied an analytical approximation to these rates. Here, we use the\nphotoionization code \\textsc{cloudy} to generate realistic heating and cooling\nrates which we then use in a 2.5D hydrodynamic model computed in ZEUS to\nsimulate thermal winds in a typical black-hole X-ray binary. We find that these\nheating and cooling rates produce a significantly more complex thermal\nequilibrium curve, with dramatically different stability properties. The\nresulting flow, calculated in the optically thin limit, is qualitatively\ndifferent from flows calculated using approximate analytical rates.\nSpecifically, our thermal disk wind is much denser and slower, with a mass-loss\nrate that is a factor of two higher and characteristic velocities that are a\nfactor of three lower. The low velocity of the flow -- $v_{max} \\simeq\n200$~km~s$^{-1}$ -- may be difficult to reconcile with observations.

For the young stars, the probably perturbed velocities similar to the\nold population are mostly removed from the velocity maps in the $X$--$Y$ plane.\nThe residual velocity field shows that the young stars consistently move along\n$Y$ with faster $v_\\phi$ at the trailing side of the local arm, while at the\nleading side, they move slower in azimuth direction. At both sides, the young\nstars averagely move inward with $v_R$ of $-5\\sim-3$ km s$^{-1}$. The\ndivergence of the velocity in $Y$ direction implies that the young stars are\nassociated with a density wave nearby the local arm. We therefore suggest that\nthe young stars may reflect the formation of the local spiral arm by\ncorrelating themselves with a density wave. The range of the age for the young\nstars is around 2 Gyr, which is sensible since the transient spiral arm can\nsustain that long.

Here we point out the existence of a new\n\"neutrino floor\" that will similarly limit indirect detection with the Sun, due\nto high-energy neutrinos from cosmic-ray interactions with the solar\natmosphere.

Dark matter in the local galactic halo,\ngravitationally accelerated to over half the speed of light, scatters against\nand deposits kinetic energy into neutron stars, heating them to infrared\nblackbody temperatures. The resulting radiation could potentially be detected\nby the James Webb Space Telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope, or the European\nExtremely Large Telescope. This mechanism also produces optical emission from\nneutron stars in the galactic bulge, and X-ray emission near the galactic\ncenter, because dark matter is denser in these regions. For GeV - PeV mass dark\nmatter, dark kinetic heating would initially unmask any spin-independent or\nspin-dependent dark matter-nucleon cross-sections exceeding $2 \\times 10^{-45}$\ncm$^2$, with improved sensitivity after more telescope exposure. For\nlighter-than-GeV dark matter, cross-section sensitivity scales inversely with\ndark matter mass because of Pauli blocking; for heavier-than-PeV dark matter,\nit scales linearly with mass as a result of needing multiple scatters for\ncapture. Future observations of dark sector-warmed neutron stars could\ndetermine whether dark matter annihilates in or only kinetically heats neutron\nstars. Because inelastic inter-state transitions of up to a few GeV would occur\nin relativistic scattering against nucleons, elusive inelastic dark matter like\npure Higgsinos can also be discovered. \n\n"}

SN2004aw is shown not to be ``broad-lined'', contrary to previous\nclaims, but rather a ``fast-lined'' SN Ic. The spectral resemblance to the\nnarrow-lined Type Ic SN1994I, combined with the strong nebular [O I] emission\nand the broad light curve, point to a moderately energetic explosion of a\nmassive C+O star. The ejected 56Ni mass is ~0.2 Msun. The ejecta mass as\nconstrained by the models is ~3-5 Msun, while the kinetic energy is estimated\nas KE ~3-6 e51 ergs. The ratio KE/Mej, the specific energy which influences the\nshape of the spectrum, is therefore ~1. The corresponding zero-age\nmain-sequence mass of the progenitor star may have been ~23-28 Msun.

Using a training set of simulated waveforms, our GPR approach\nproduces interpolated waveforms along with uncertainties across the parameter\nspace. As a proof of concept, we use a training set of IMRPhenomD waveforms to\nbuild a GPR model in the 2-d parameter space of mass ratio $q$ and\nequal-and-aligned spin $\\chi_1=\\chi_2$.

The challenging requirement is that the resonance has twice the\ndark matter mass to one part in a million.

The resonance is the heaviest state in the dark matter flavor\nmultiplet and the required mass relation is protected by the vacuum structure\nand supersymmetry from radiative corrections. The pseudo-Nambu Goldstone Bosons\n(PNGB's) from the dark flavor symmetry breaking can be slightly lighter than\none GeV and dominantly decay into two muons just from kinematics, with\nsubsequent decay into positrons. The PNGB's are produced in resonant dark\nmatter semi-annihilation, where two dark matter particles annihilate into an\nanti-dark matter particle and a PNGB.

The mass accretion rate fluctuations originate from\nvariability of viscosity, which arises at every radius and causes local\nfluctuations of the density. The fluctuations diffuse through the disc and\nresult in local variability of the mass accretion rate, which modulates the\nX-ray flux from the inner disc in the case of black holes, or from the surface\nin the case of neutron stars. A key role in the theoretical explanation of fast\nvariability belongs to the description of the diffusion process. The\npropagation and evolution of the fluctuations is described by the diffusion\nequation, which can be solved by the method of Green functions. We implement\nGreen functions in order to accurately describe the propagation of fluctuations\nin the disc. For the first time we consider both forward and backward\npropagation. We show that (i) viscous diffusion efficiently suppress\nvariability at time scales shorter than the viscous time, (ii) local\nfluctuations of viscosity affect the mass accretion rate variability both in\nthe inner and the outer parts of accretion disc, (iii) propagating fluctuations\ngive rise not only to hard time lags as previously shown, but also produce soft\nlags at high frequency similar to those routinely attributed to reprocessing,\n(iv) deviation from the linear rms-flux relation is predicted for the case of\nvery large initial perturbations.

The best studied neutron star in\nthis respect is the Crab Pulsar. The first glitch recorded in this pulsar\noccurred in 1969 Sep, at an epoch when timing observations were still in their\ninfancy, the regularity of the observations was relatively poor, and errors on\nthe observations were relatively high. Lyne et al. (1993) analyzed most of the\navailable data using modern techniques, and showed that this was a typical\nglitch of the Crab pulsar, with typical glitch parameters. This work analyses\nall available data, and shows that the 1969 event in the Crab pulsar is\namenable to radically different interpretations. The Crab pulsar was timed by\nfive different groups during this epoch, one at radio and the rest at optical\nfrequencies. These data are available in the public domain, and have been\nanalyzed using the TEMPO2 software. The 1969 event in the Crab pulsar can be\nbetter modeled as a typical glitch that was interrupted by a non-glitch\nspeed-up event. This work also confirms the existence of a quasi-sinusoidal\noscillation in the timing noise of the Crab pulsar, that was reported by\nRichards et al. (1970), but with a smaller period, and with its amplitude and\nperiod decreasing with time, like a chirp signal. Such a coherent oscillation\nhas not been noticed so far in either the Crab or any other pulsar. This work\nprovides an explanation for the post-glitch behavior of the Crab pulsar\nglitches of 1969 Sep and 2004 Nov, and similar glitches in other pulsars, in\nterms of the recently proposed non-glitch speed-up event. If true, then\nnon-glitch speed-up events may not be as rare as believed earlier. This work\nargues that it is unlikely that the frequency and amplitude modulated\nsinusoidal variation in the timing noise is due to unmodeled planetary\ncompanions. \n\n"}

Though a smoothly broken powerlaw function like Band provides an\nexcellent fit to most of the cases, a spectrum with a broad top or double hump\nstructure has emerged recently for several GRBs, specifically for the bright\nones that have high signal to noise data. A number of models have been proposed\nto capture this shape which includes an additional blackbody component along\nwith the Band, or a double smoothly broken powerlaw, or two blackbodies with a\npowerlaw/cut-off powerlaw and so on. However, finding the statistically\nfavourable model has not always been possible primarily due to the limited\nresolution of GRB detectors. Recently, we have identified a number of\ninteresting cases where an observation with focusing detectors are available at\na later part of the prompt emission. Their high resolution data helped in\nidentifying additional spectral component (a blackbody) in lower energies. The\nproposed THESEUS mission, with its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral\nresolution available from the very beginning of the prompt emission holds the\nkey to identify the correct spectral model and thereby the radiation process. \n\n"}

The post-peak optical light curves show a long,\nlinear decline with a steep slope of 2.5 mag/100 days (i.e., an exponential\ndecline in flux), through the end of observations at phase ~260 days. In\ncontrast, the light curves of hydrogen rich supernovae (SNe II-P/L) always show\nbreaks in their light curves at phase ~100 days, before settling onto Co56\nradioactive decay tails with a decline rate of about 1 mag/100 days. The\nspectra of ASASSN-15nx do not exhibit the narrow emission-line features\ncharacteristic of Type IIn SNe, which can have a wide variety of light-curve\nshapes usually attributed to strong interactions with a dense circumstellar\nmedium (CSM). ASASSN-15nx has a number of spectroscopic peculiarities,\nincluding a relatively weak and triangularly-shaped H-alpha emission profile\nwith no absorption component. The physical origin of these peculiarities is\nunclear, but the long and linear post-peak light curve without a break suggests\na single dominant powering mechanism. Decay of a large amount of Ni56 (M_Ni56 =\n1.6 +/- 0.2 M_sun) can power the light curve of ASASSN-15nx, and the steep\nlight-curve slope requires substantial gamma-ray escape from the ejecta, which\nis possible given a low-mass hydrogen envelope for the progenitor.

The system consists of fluid ions\nand electrons as well as arbitrary numbers of species whose dynamics is\ngoverned by the Vlasov equation. The proposed model is thus a generalized\nversion of the well-known standard hybrid plasma simulation model, in which the\nions are fully kinetic whereas the electrons are assumed to be a fluid. Since\nthe proposed model employs the exact form of the generalized Ohm's law, the\nmass and energy densities, as well as the charge-to-mass ratio of the kinetic\nspecies, are taken to be arbitrary. In the absence of the kinetic species, it\nreduces to the quasi-neutral two-fluid model (Amano, 2015, JCP). In the\nopposite situation where the mass and energy densities of the kinetic species\nare much larger than the fluid ions, it is nothing more than the standard\nhybrid model with finite electron inertia effect. If the kinetic species is an\nenergetic particle (EP) population having negligible mass density but\nsubstantial energy density and the scale size is much larger than the ion and\nelectron inertial lengths, it describes the self-consistent coupling between\nthe magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and the EP dynamics. The\nenergetic-particle-magnetohydrodynamics (EP-MHD) hybrid model is thus a special\ncase of the more general model described in this paper. Advantages of this\napproach over the existing models are discussed. A three-dimensional simulation\ncode solving the proposed set of equations is described. The code combines the\nParticle-in-Cell scheme for solving the kinetic species and a\nRiemann-solver-based code for the two-fluid equations. Several benchmark\nsimulation results are shown to confirm that the code successfully captures the\ndynamics of the EP population interacting self-consistently with the MHD fluid. \n\n"}

The\nnova speed class is unknown because of lack of the earliest half of optical\nlight curve and short supersoft X-ray phase due to eclipse by the disk rim.\nUsing the universal decline law and time-stretching method, we analyzed the\ndata of V959 Mon and obtained nova parameters.

For only a\nhandful of SNe, the progenitor star has been identified in pre-explosion\nimages. Supernova remnants (SNRs), which are observed long after the original\nSN event, provide a unique opportunity to increase the number of progenitor\nmeasurements. Here, we systematically examine the stellar populations in the\nvicinities of 23 known SNRs in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using the star\nformation history (SFH) maps of Harris & Zaritsky (2004). We combine the\nresults with constraints on the SNR metal abundances and environment from X-ray\nand optical observations. We find that 22 SNRs in the SMC have local SFHs and\nproperties consistent with a CC explosion, several of which are likely to have\nbeen high-mass progenitors. This result supports recent theoretical findings\nthat high-mass progenitors can produce successful explosions. We estimate the\nmass distribution of the CC progenitors and find that this distribution is\nsimilar to a Salpeter IMF (within the uncertainties), while this result is\nshallower than the mass distribution found in M31 and M33 by Jennings et al.\n(2014) and D\\'{\\i}az-Rodr\\'{\\i}guez et al.

The vector dark matter in the hidden sector does not\ndirectly couple to the visible sector, but instead annihilates into the hidden\nHiggs bosons which decay through a small coupling into the CP-odd Higgs bosons.\nIn this model, the Galactic center gamma-ray excess is mainly due to the 2-step\ncascade annihilation with $\\tau$'s in the final state. The obtained mass of the\nCP-odd Higgs $A$ in the Galactic center excess fit can explain the muon $g-2$\nanomaly at the 2$\\sigma$ level without violating the stringent constraints from\nthe lepton universality and $\\tau$ decays.

Both a relativistic structured jet viewed off-axis and a mildly\nrelativistic quasi-spherical outflow can explain the observational data of\nGW170817 up to ~260 days. We utilize a physically motivated analytic\ntwo-parameter model called the \"boosted fireball\" for the outflow structure\nafter it has expanded far from the merger site and has entered the self-similar\ncoasting phase. This model consists of a family of outflows with a structure\nvarying smoothly between a highly collimated ultra-relativistic jet and an\nisotropic fireball. We simulate the dynamical evolution, starting with \"boosted\nfireball\" initial conditions, of 240 outflows using the moving-mesh\nrelativistic hydrodynamics code JET to follow their evolution through the\nafterglow phase. We compute nearly 2,000,000 synchrotron spectra from the\nhydrodynamic simulations using the standard synchrotron radiation model. By\nmaking use of scaling relations in the hydrodynamic and radiation equations, we\ndevelop a synthetic light curve generator with an efficient sampling speed.\nThis allows us to fit the observational data by performing Markov-Chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) analysis in a 8-dimensional parameter space, consisting of\nhydrodynamic parameters, radiation parameters and observational parameters.

However, recent works have suggested the existence of an intermediate\npopulation in the bursts observed by the Swift satellite. Moreover, some\nresearchers have questioned the universality of the 2.0-second dividing line\nbetween short and long bursts: some bursts may be short but actually result\nfrom collapsars, the physical mechanism behind normally long bursts, and some\nlong ones may originate from mergers, the usual progenitors of short GRBs. In\nthis work, we focus on GRBs detected by the Fermi satellite and study the\ndistribution of their durations measured in the observer's reference frame and,\nfor those with known redshifts, in the bursts' reference frames. However, there\nare relatively few bursts with measured redshifts, and this makes an accurate\nstudy difficult. To overcome this problem, we follow [Zhang:2018] and determine\na \"pseudo-redshift\" from the correlation relation between the luminosity $L_p$\nand the energy $E_p$, both of which are calculated at the peak of the flux.\nInterestingly, we find that the uncertainties in the quantities observed and\nused in the determination of pseudo-redshifts, do affect the precision of the\nindividual results significantly, but they keep the distribution of\npseudo-redshifts very similar to that of the actual ones and thus allow us to\nuse pseudo-redshifts for our statistical study. We use the reduced chi-square\nand the maximization of the log-likelihood to statistically analyze the\ndistribution of Fermi GRB durations. Both methods show that the distribution of\nthe observed and the intrinsic bursts durations are better represented by two\ngroups, rather than three. \n\n"}

This object was selected as a hyper-luminous\nDOG candidate at z ~ 2 by combining the optical and IR photometric data based\non the SDSS and WISE, although its redshift had not yet been confirmed.

Moreover, we indicate that this object\nseems to have an extremely massive black hole with M_BH = 10^10.92 M_sun based\non the broad Halpha line: the host stellar mass is derived as M_star = 10^13.55\nM_sun by a fit of the spectral energy distribution.

A fraction >20% of SGRBs are followed\nby temporally-extended (>~ minute-long), variable X-ray emission, attributed to\nongoing activity of the central engine. One source of late-time engine activity\nis fall-back accretion of bound tidal ejecta; however, observed extended\nemission light curves do not track the naively-anticipated, uninterrupted\n~t^{-5/3} power-law decay, instead showing a lull or gap in emission typically\nlasting tens of seconds after the burst. Here, we re-examine the impact of\nheating due to rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis on rate of the\nfall-back accretion, using ejecta properties obtained from numerical relativity\nsimulations of NS-BH mergers in a toy model for the dynamical influence of\nnuclear heating. Depending on the mass of the remnant black hole, r-process\nheating can imprint a variety of fall-back curve shapes, ranging from temporal\nlulls of up to tens of seconds to complete late-time cut-off in the fall-back\nrate. This behavior is robust to realistic variations in the nuclear heating\nexperienced by different parts of the ejecta. Central black holes with masses\n<~ 3 Msun typically experience absolute cut-offs in the fall-back rate, while\nmore massive >6-8 Msun black holes instead show temporal gaps. We thus propose\nthat SGRBs with extended emission arise from NS-BH, rather than NS-NS, mergers.\nOur model implies a NS-BH merger detection rate by LIGO which, in steady-state,\nis comparable to or greater than that of NS-NS mergers. \n\n"}

To do this, we first\nsummarise the observational evidence for the value of the dimensionless\naccretion disc viscosity parameter $\\alpha$, defined by Shakura & Sunyaev\n(1973, 1976). We find that, for fully ionized discs, the value of $\\alpha$ is\nreadily amenable to reliable estimation and that the observations are\nconsistent with the hypothesis that $\\alpha \\sim 0.2 - 0.3$. In contrast in\ndiscs that are not fully ionized, estimates of the value of $\\alpha$ are\ngenerally less direct and the values obtained are generally $ < 0.01$ and often\n$ \\ll 0.01$. We conclude that this gives us crucial information about the\nnature of viscosity in accretion discs. First, in fully ionized discs the\nstrength of the turbulence is always limited by being at most trans-sonic. This\nimplies that it is necessary that credible models of the turbulence reflect\nthis fact.

Capturing correlation within the\napproximation requires an explicit parametrization.

We propose Metric Gaussian\nVariational Inference (MGVI) as a method that goes beyond mean-field. Here\ncorrelations between all model parameters are taken into account, while still\nscaling linearly in computational time and memory. With this method we achieve\nhigher accuracy and in many cases a significant speedup compared to traditional\nmethods. MGVI is an iterative method that performs a series of Gaussian\napproximations to the posterior. We alternate between approximating the\ncovariance with the inverse Fisher information metric evaluated at an\nintermediate mean estimate and optimizing the KL-divergence for the given\ncovariance with respect to the mean. This procedure is iterated until the\nuncertainty estimate is self-consistent with the mean parameter. We achieve\nlinear scaling by avoiding to store the covariance explicitly at any time.\nInstead we draw samples from the approximating distribution relying on an\nimplicit representation and numerical schemes to approximately solve linear\nequations.

We construct simple\nanalytical models for the viscous evolution of fallback disks to show that it\nis possible for these disks to become neutral when they are still young (ages\nof a few 10^3 to 10^4 years), compact in size (a few 10^9 cm to 10^11 cm) and\ngenerally accreting at sub-Eddington rates (Mdot ~ a few 10^14 - 10^18 g/s).\nBased on recent results on the nature of viscosity in the disks of close\nbinaries, we argue that this time may also correspond to the end of the disk\nactivity period. Indeed, in the absence of a significant source of viscosity in\nthe neutral phase, the entire disk will likely turn to dust and become passive.\nWe discuss various applications of the evolutionary model, including anomalous\nX-ray pulsars and young radio pulsars.

Three mechanisms of extracting energy\nmagnetically are involved. (1) The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process is related to\nthe open magnetic field lines connecting the BH with the astrophysical load;\n(2) the magnetic coupling (MC) process is related to the closed magnetic field\nlines connecting the BH with its surrounding disk; and (3) a new scenario\n(henceforth the DL process) for extracting rotational energy from the disk is\nrelated to the open field lines connecting the disk with the astrophysical\nload. The expressions for the electromagnetic powers and torques are derived by\nusing the equivalent circuits corresponding to the above energy mechanisms. It\nturns out that the DL power is comparable with the BZ and MC powers as the BH\nspin approaches unity. The radiation from a quasi-steady thin disk is discussed\nin detail by applying the conservation laws of mass, energy and angular\nmomentum to the regions corresponding to the MC and DL processes. In addition,\nthe poloidal currents and the current densities in BH magnetosphere are\ncalculated by using the equivalent circuits. \n\n"}

The method is naturally restricted to inclined showers where muons\ndominate the signal at ground level but could be extended to vertical showers\nprovided that the detectors used can separate the muon signal from electrons\nand photons.

Together with the known effective temperature of\nT_eff ~ 10,500 K (spectral type B9), this variability implies that the HVS is a\nmember of the class of slowly pulsating B-type main sequence stars, thus\nresolving the previously-reported two-fold degeneracy in the luminosity and\ndistance of the star.

This\nreport gives a review of the physics and astrophysics associated with the\nquestions of origin and propagation of these Extremely High Energy (EHE) cosmic\nrays in the Universe. After a brief review of the observed cosmic rays in\ngeneral and their possible sources and acceleration mechanisms, a detailed\ndiscussion is given of possible \"top-down\" (non-acceleration) scenarios of\norigin of EHE cosmic rays through decay of sufficiently massive particles\noriginating from processes in the early Universe.

Abstract: Recent Super-Kamiokande data have greatly strengthened the hypothesis that\nthe atmospheric neutrino anomaly is mainly due to nearly maximal oscillations\nbetween $\\nu_{\\mu}$ and either $\\nu_{\\tau}$ or a sterile neutrino\n$\\nu^s_{\\mu}$.In this letter we point out that the decaying neutrino theory for\nthe ionisation of hydrogen in the interstellar medium, in conjunction with the\nassumption that the cosmological constant $\\lambda$ is zero, requires these\noscillations to be between $\\nu_{\\mu}$ and $\\nu^s_{\\mu}$. This requirement can\nbe tested by forthcoming Super-Kamiokande measurements. A further requirement\ncan be derived if the solar neutrino deficit is energy dependent and if both it\nand the LSND data are also due to neutrino oscillations. In that case the\ndecaying neutrino theory alone (without any assumption about the value of\n$\\lambda$) requires both that the atmospheric anomaly is due to\n$\\nu_{\\mu}-\\nu^s_{\\mu}$ oscillations and that the solar neutrino oscillations\nare between $\\nu_e$ and a second sterile neutrino $\\nu^s_e$.
