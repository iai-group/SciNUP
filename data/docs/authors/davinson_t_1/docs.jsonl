We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations. We also find that\nthe mass in the failed cores is comparable to that in stellar cores at n_thr =\n1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3, but becomes negligible at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3, in\nagreement with recent observational suggestions that at the latter densities\nthe cores are in general gravitationally dominated. We conclude by noting that\nthe timescale for core contraction and collapse is virtually the same in the\nsubcritical, ambipolar diffusion-mediated model of star formation, in the model\nof star formation in turbulent supercritical clouds, and in a model\nintermediate between the previous two, for currently accepted values of the\nclouds' magnetic criticality. \n\n"}

If these particles make up the dark\nmatter, then they can be captured by the Sun or the Earth, sink to the\nrespective cores, annihilate, and produce neutrinos. Thus, these neutrinos can\nbe a striking dark matter signature at neutrino telescopes looking towards the\nSun and/or the Earth. Here, we improve previous analyses on computing the\nneutrino yields from WIMP annihilations in several respects. We include\nneutrino oscillations in a full three-flavor framework as well as all effects\nfrom neutrino interactions on the way through the Sun (absorption, energy loss,\nand regeneration from tau decays). In addition, we study the effects of\nnon-zero values of the mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ as well as the normal and\ninverted neutrino mass hierarchies. Our study is performed in an event-based\nsetting which makes these results very useful both for theoretical analyses and\nfor building a neutrino telescope Monte Carlo code.

We\nfind that the yield of muon-type neutrinos from WIMP annihilations in the Sun\nis enhanced or suppressed, depending on the dominant WIMP annihilation channel.\nThis effect is due to an effective flavor mixing caused by neutrino\noscillations. For WIMP annihilations inside the Earth, the distance from source\nto detector is too small to allow for any significant amount of oscillations at\nthe neutrino energies relevant for neutrino telescopes. \n\n"}

The distinguishing property\nof the model is that the large ``stellar'' radius of 160 AU required to prevent\nadiabatic losses is not the true stellar radius, but rather, the radius of an\nopaque, unbound circumstellar envelope, created when 10 Msun was ejected in the\ndecade before the supernova in an eruption analogous to that of eta Carinae.\nThe supernova light is produced primarily by diffusion of thermal energy\nfollowing the passage of the blast wave through this shell. This model differs\nfrom traditional models of supernova debris interacting with external CSM in\nthat here the shell is optically thick and the escape of radiation is delayed.\nWe show that any model attempting to account for SN2006gy's huge luminosity\nwith radiation emitted by ongoing CSM interaction fails for the following basic\nreason: the CSM density required to achieve the observed luminosity makes the\nsame circumstellar envelope opaque, forcing a thermal diffusion solution. In\nour model, the weaker CSM interaction giving rise to SN2006gy's characteristic\nType IIn spectrum and soft X-rays is not linked to the power source of the\nvisual continuum; instead, it arises after the blast wave breaks free of the\nopaque shell into the surrounding wind.

We begin\nin this paper with a derivation of the self-force on a compact object moving in\nthe background spacetime of a supermassive black hole. The EFT approach\nutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the\nsize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background\nspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an\neffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\\it partie finie} to isolate the\nnon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. The latter is\nconstructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retarded\npropagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which only\nlogarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of the\ntheory. As a first important application of this framework we explicitly derive\nthe first order self-force given by Mino, Sasaki, Tanaka, Quinn and Wald.

Furthermore, such dust inhibits the ability of\nobservationally-determined inclination corrections to recover intrinsic (i.e.\ndust free) galaxy parameters. Using the sophisticated 3D radiative transfer\nmodel of Popescu et al. and Tuffs et al., together with Driver et al.'s recent\ndetermination of the average face-on opacity in nearby disc galaxies, we\nprovide simple equations to correct (observed) disc central surface\nbrightnesses and scalelengths for the effects of both inclination and dust in\nthe B, V, I, J and K passband.

Even though the search was optimized primarily\nfor detecting the emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), it was still sensitive\nto the emission from the last stages of the evaporation of Primordial Black\nHoles or to any other kind of phenomena that produce bursts of VHE gamma rays.\nMeasurements of the GRB spectra by satellites up to few tens of GeV showed no\nsigns of a cutoff. Even though multiple instruments sensitive to $GeV/TeV$\ngamma rays have performed observations of GRBs, there has not yet been a\ndefinitive detection of such an emission yet. One of the reasons for that is\nthat gamma rays with energies E>~100GeV are attenuated by interactions with the\nextragalactic background light or are absorbed internally at the site of the\nburst. There are many models that predict VHE gamma-ray emission from GRBs. A\ndetection or a constraint of such an emission can provide useful information on\nthe mechanism and environment of GRBs. This study performed a blind search of\nthe Milagro data of the last five years for bursts of VHE gamma rays with\ndurations ranging from 100musec to 316sec. No GRB localization was provided by\nan external instrument. Instead, the whole dataset was thoroughly searched in\ntime, space, and duration. No significant events were detected. Upper limits\nwere placed on the VHE emission from GRBs. \n\n"}

Deep VLBI observations imply that\napproximately 50 per cent of the radio emission is extended on scales > 200pc.\nThe inferred AGN luminosity is sufficient to ionize the extended halo, and the\noptical emission is consistent with being triggered coevally with the radio\nsource. The Lyman-alpha halo is as luminous as those found around high redshift\nradio galaxies, however the active nucleus is several orders of magnitude less\nluminous at radio wavelengths than those FRIIs more commonly associated with\nextended emission line regions. AMS05 appears to be a high-redshift analogue to\nthe radio-quiet quasar E1821+643 which is core dominated but which also\nexhibits extended FRI-like structure and contains an optically powerful AGN.

Double beta experiments are long-running underground\nexperiments with specific challenges concerning the background reduction and\nthe long term stability. These problems are addressed in this work for the\nHeidelberg-Moscow (HdM), GENIUS Test Facility (TF) and GERDA experiments. The\nHdM experiment collected data with enriched 76Ge high purity (HPGe) detectors\nfrom 1990 to 2003.

The first year results of this\nexperiment are discussed.

However, if the model matches the galaxy\nmass function, properties of central galaxies are sufficiently converged to\ngive small differences in merger rates.

In this energy regime the effective break-up cross\nsection for a c-cbar dipole depends on energy and nuclear path length, and\nagrees well with data from fixed target experiments, both in magnitude and\nenergy dependence. At higher energies of RHIC and LHC coherence in c-cbar pair\nproduction leads to charm quark shadowing which is a complement to the high\ntwist break up cross section. These two effects explain well with no adjusted\nparameters the magnitude and rapidity dependence of nuclear suppression of\nJ/Psi observed at RHIC in dAu collisions, while the contribution of leading\ntwist gluon shadowing is found to be vanishingly small. A novel mechanism of\ndouble color filtering for c-cbar dipoles makes nuclei significantly more\ntransparent in AA compared to pA collisions.

We find that the presence of a massive gaseous disc allows\nrecoiled BHs to return to the centre on a much shorter timescale than for\npurely stellar discs. Also, BH accretion and feedback can strongly modify the\norbit of recoiled BHs and hence their return timescale, besides affecting the\ndistribution of gas and stars in the galactic centre. However, the dynamical\ninteraction of kicked BHs with the surrounding medium is in general complex and\ncan facilitate both a fast return to the centre as well as a significant delay.\nThe Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rates of the recoiling BHs in our simulated\ngalaxies are favourably high for the detection of off-centred AGN if kicked\nwithin gas-rich discs -- up to a few per cent of the Eddington accretion rate\n-- and are highly variable on timescales of a few 10^7 yrs.

Reliable data for 184 and\n146 bona fide cluster star members, respectively for NGC 1851 and NGC 1904,\nwere obtained.\n  These data allow to trace the velocity dispersion profile up to ~2r0, where\nr0 is the radius at which the cluster internal acceleration of gravity is a0 =\n10e-8 cm/s/s.

Based on the\nlatest hydrodynamical simulations, heavy r-process elements cannot be\nsynthesized in the neutrino-driven winds that follow the supernova explosion.\nHowever, by artificially increasing the wind entropy, elements up to A=195 can\nbe made. In this way one can reproduce the typical behavior of high-entropy\nejecta where the r-process is expected to occur. We identify which nuclear\nphysics input is more important depending on the dynamical evolution of the\nejecta. When the evolution proceeds at high temperatures (hot r-process), an\n(n,g)-(g,n) equilibrium is reached. While at low temperature (cold r-process)\nthere is a competition between neutron captures and beta decays.

IV. radial velocity distribution Abstract: We present new and accurate radial velocity (RV) measurements of luminous\nstars of all ages (old horizontal branch, intermediate--age red clump, and\nyoung blue plume, as well as red giants of a range of ages; 20.6<V<22) in the\nCarina dwarf spheroidal galaxy, based on low-resolution spectra collected with\nthe FORS2 multi-object slit spectrograph at the VLT. This data set was\ncomplemented by RV measurements based on medium and high-resolution archive\nspectra of brighter (V<20.6) Carina targets collected with the GIRAFFE\nmulti-object fiber spectrograph at the VLT. The combined sample includes more\nthan 21,340 individual spectra of ~2,000 stars covering the entire body of the\ngalaxy. To further improve the statistics, the accurate RV measurements\nrecently provided by Walker et al.(2007) were also added to the current data\nset. We ended up with a sample of ~1,370 RV measurements of candidate Carina\nstars that is ~75% larger than any previous Carina RV sample. The mean RV\nacross the body of the galaxy varies from ~220 km/s at a distance of 7arcmin\n(~200 pc) from the center to ~223 km/s at 13arcmin, (~400 pc, 6sigma level) and\nflattens out to a constant value of ~221 km/s at larger distances (600 pc,\n4sigma level). Moreover and even more importantly, we found that in the Carina\nregions where the mean RV is smaller the dispersion is also smaller, and the RV\ndistribution is more centrally peaked (i.e. the kurtosis attains larger\nvalues). There is evidence of a secondary maximum in RV across the Carina\ncenter (|D|<200 pc). The occurrence of a secondary feature across the Carina\ncenter is also supported by the flat-topped radial distribution based on the\nphotometric catalog. \n\n"}

We demonstrate that for sufficiently\nasymmetric case and high densities the momentum distribution of the smaller\np-component is strongly deformed with protons increasingly populating the\nmomentum states beyond the Fermi surface. This result is obtained by extracting\nthe probabilities of two-nucleon (2N) SRCs from the analysis of the\nexperimental data on high momentum transfer inclusive electro-nuclear\nreactions. We fitted the extracted probabilities as a function of nuclear\ndensity and asymmetry and used the fit to estimate the fractions of the\noff-Fermi shell nucleons in the superdense nuclear matter relevant to neutron\nstars. Our results indicate that starting at three nuclear saturation densities\nthe protons with fractional densities 1/9 will populate mostly the high\nmomentum tail of the momentum distribution while only 2% of the neutrons will\ndo so. We discuss the implications of this condition for neutron stars and\nemphasize that it may be characteristic to any asymmetric two component Fermi\nsystem with suppressed central and enhanced short-range tensor interactions\nbetween the two components. \n\n"}

As a consequence, we can study the reliability of the\nthermodynamical quantities through the consistency of the two methods, each of\nwhich has different origin of the application limit.\n  The thermodynamical quantities are obtained from simulations on a $8^3\\times\n4$ lattice with an intermediate quark mass($m_{\\rm PS}/m_{\\rm V}=0.8)$. The MPR\nand Taylor expansion are consistent for the EoS and number density up to\n$\\mu/T\\sim 0.8$ and for the number susceptibility up to $\\mu/T \\sim 0.6$. This\nimplies within a given statistics that the overlap problem for the MPR and\ntruncation error for the Taylor expansion method are negligible in these\nregions.\n  In order to make MPR methods work, the fluctuation of the reweighting factor\nshould be small. We derive the equation of the reweighting line where the\nfluctuation is small, and show that the equation of the reweighting line is\nconsistent with the fluctuation minimum condition. \n\n"}

On\nthe other hand, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) struggles to prevent the\nrunaway cooling catastrophe, injecting huge amount of energy in the ISM. The\npresent study intends to deeply investigate the role of mechanical AGN feedback\nin (isolated or massive) elliptical galaxies, extending and completing the mass\nrange of tested cosmic environments. Our previously successful feedback models,\nin galaxy clusters and groups, demonstrated that AGN outflows, self-regulated\nby cold gas accretion, are able to properly quench the cooling flow, without\ndestroying the cool core.

Thus the difference of the EMC ratio\nfrom one reveals the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom in nuclei.\nUsing exact QCD sum rules we show that the ratio R_A(x_p,Q^2) used in\nexperimental studies, where x_p = Q^2/2q_0 m_p deviates from one even if a\nnucleus consists of nucleons with small momenta only. Use of the Bjorken x\nleads to additional decrease of R_A(x,Q^2) as compared to the x_p plots.\nCoherent contribution of equivalent photons into photon component of parton\nwave function of a nucleus unambiguously follows from Lorentz transformation of\nthe rest frame nucleus Coulomb field.

This leads to the fact that scalar radiation is emitted\nfrom a binary containing at least one BH. In this letter, we find the\nconstraints on this theory from BH low-mass X-ray binaries (BH-LMXBs). The main\nresult of this letter is that from the orbital decay rate of A0620-00, we\nobtained a conservative bound that is six orders of magnitude stronger than the\nsolar system bound. In addition to this, we look at XTE J1118+480, whose\norbital decay rate has been recently measured with an excess compared to the\ntheoretical prediction in GR due to the radiation reaction. The cause of this\nexcess is currently unknown. Although it is likely that the cause is of\nastrophysical origin, here we investigate the possibility of explaining this\nexcess with the additional scalar radiation in sGB theory. We find that there\nstill remains a parameter range where the excess can be explained while also\nsatisfying the constraint obtained from A0620-00. The interesting point is that\nfor most of other alternative theories of gravity, it seems difficult to\nexplain this excess with the additional radiation. This is because it would be\ndifficult to evade the constraints from binary pulsars or they have already\nbeen constrained rather strongly from other observations such as solar system\nexperiments. We propose several ways to determine whether the excess is caused\nby the scalar radiation in sGB gravity including future gravitational wave\nobservations with space-borne interferometers, which can give a constraint\nthree orders of magnitude stronger than that from A0620-00. \n\n"}

We establish a simple\nprescription for preparing equivalent RMF and SHF parametrizations starting\nfrom a minimal set of empirical constraints on symmetric nuclear matter,\nnuclear binding energy and charge radii, enforcing equivalence of their Lorenz\neffective masses, and then using the pure neutron matter (PNM) equation of\nstate (EoS) obtained from ab-initio calculations to optimize the pure isovector\nparameters in the RMF and SHF models. We find the resulting RMF and SHF\nparametrizations give broadly consistent predictions of the symmetry energy J\nand its slope parameter L at saturation density within a tight range of <~2 MeV\nand <~6 MeV respectively, but that clear model dependence shows up in the\npredictions of higher-order symmetry energy parameters, leading to important\ndifferences in (a) the slope of the correlation between J and L from the\nconfidence ellipse, (b) the isospin-dependent part of the incompressibility of\nnuclear matter K_tau, (c) the symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities,\nand (d) the predicted neutron star radii.

This correlation may indicate the larger modification of nucleons with\nhigher momentum thus making the nucleon virtuality as the most relevant\nparameter of medium modifications. To check this conjecture we study the\nimplication of several properties of high momentum component of the nuclear\nwave function on the characteristics of EMC effect. We observe two main reasons\nfor the EMC-SRC correlation: first, the decrease of the contribution from the\nnuclear mean field due to the increase, with A, the fraction of the high\nmomentum component of nuclear wave function. Second, the increase of the medium\nmodification of nucleons in SRC. Our main prediction however is the increase of\nthe proton contribution to the EMC effect for large A asymmetric nuclei. This\nprediction is based on the recent observation of the strong dominance of pn\nSRCs in the high momentum component of nuclear wave function.

The fraction of the power dissipated in the corona decreases with\nincreasing black hole spin parameter $a$, which leads to lower electron\ntemperatures of the coronas for rapidly spinning black holes.

Here we expand on earlier work by Strohmayer (2009) who\nused only a part of the present data set. Our primary results are: (1) the\ndiscovery of sharp, quasi-periodic, energy-independent dips in the X-ray\nintensity that recur on average every 243 days, (2) the detection of an\nenergy-dependent (variability amplitude decreases with increasing energy),\nquasi-sinusoidal X-ray modulation with a period of 112.6+-4 days the amplitude\nof which weakens during the second half of the light curve and (3) spectral\nevidence for an increase in photoelectric absorption during the last continuous\nsegment of the data. We interpret the X-ray modulations within the context of\nbinary motion in analogy to that seen in high-inclination accreting X-ray\nbinaries. If correct, this implies that NGC 5408 X-1 is in a binary with an\norbital period of 243+-23 days, in contrast to the 115.5 day quasi-sinusoidal\nperiod previously reported by Strohmayer (2009).

Our main results can\nbe summarized as follows: i) neutron star mergers can be entirely responsible\nfor the production of Eu in the Galaxy if the coalescence time scale is no\nlonger than 1 Myr for the bulk of binary systems, the Eu yield is around $3\n\\times 10^{-7}$ M$_\\odot$, and the mass range of progenitors of neutron stars\nis 9-50 M$_\\odot$; ii) both type II supernovae and merging neutron stars can\nproduce the right amount of Eu if the neutron star mergers produce $2 \\times\n10^{-7}$ M$_\\odot$ per system and type II supernovae, with progenitors in the\nrange 20-50 M$_\\odot$, produce yields of Eu of the order of $10^{-8}-10^{-9}$\nM$_\\odot$; iii) either models with only neutron stars producing Eu or mixed\nones can reproduce the observed Eu abundance gradient along the Galactic disc. \n\n"}

The f(R)\ngravity whose strength is controlled to satisfy the current observational\nconstraints on the cluster scale is adopted as our fiducial model and a large\nN-body simulation of high-resolution is utilized for this study. By applying\nthe minimal spanning tree algorithm to the halo catalogs from the simulation at\nvarious epochs, we identify the main stems of the rich superclusters located in\nthe most prominent filamentary section of the cosmic web and determine their\nspatial extents per member cluster as the degree of their straightness. It is\nfound that the $f(R)$ gravity has an effect of significantly bending the\nsuperclusters and that the effect becomes stronger as the universe evolves.\nEven in the case where the deviation from GR is too small to be detectable by\nany other observables, the degree of the supercluster straightness exhibits\nconspicuous difference between the $f(R)$ and the GR models. Our results also\nimply that the supercluster straightness could be a useful discriminator of\nf(R) gravity from the coupled dark energy since it is shown to evolve\ndifferently between the two models.

It has\npreviously been classified as a low-peaked BL Lac object based on its broadband\nemission and the absence of optical emission lines. Optical measurements,\nhowever, suffer strongly from extinction and the absence of pronounced\nshort-time gamma-ray variability over years of monitoring is unusual for a\nblazar. We are combining new and archival multiwavelength data in order to\nreconsider the classification and nature of this unusual gamma-ray source. For\nthe first time, we study the radio morphology at 8.4GHz and 22.3GHz, and its\nspectral properties on milliarcsecond (mas) scales, based on VLBI observations\nfrom the TANAMI program. We combine the resulting images with multiwavelength\ndata in the radio, IR, optical/UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray regimes. PMNJ1603-4904\nshows a symmetric brightness distribution at 8.4GHz on mas-scales, with the\nbrightest, and most compact component in the center of the emission region. The\nmorphology is reminiscent of a Compact Symmetric Object (CSO). Such objects\nhave been predicted to produce gamma-ray emission but have not been detected as\na class by Fermi/LAT so far. Sparse (u, v)-coverage at 22.3GHz prevents an\nunambiguous modeling of the source morphology. IR measurements reveal an excess\nin the spectral energy distribution (SED), which can be modeled with a\nblackbody with a temperature of about 1600K, and which is usually not present\nin blazar SEDs. The VLBI data and the shape of the SED challenge the current\nblazar classification. PMNJ1603-4904 seems to be either a highly peculiar BL\nLac object or a misaligned jet source.

Eta Car's ultra-violet, optical, and X-ray light curves and its\nspectrum suggest a physical change in its stellar wind over the last decade. It\nwas proposed that the mass-loss rate decreased by a factor of about 2 in the\nlast 15 years. We complement these recent results by investigating the past\nevolution and the current state of eta Car in the near-infrared (IR). Methods.\nWe present JHKL photometry of eta Car obtained at SAAO Sutherland from\n2004-2013 with the Mk II photometer at the 0.75-m telescope and JHKs photometry\nwith SIRIUS at the 1.4-m IRSF telescope from 2012-2013. The near-IR light\ncurves since 1972 are analyzed. Results. The long-term brightening trends in\neta Car's JHKL light curves were discontinuous around the 1998 periastron\npassage. After 1998, the star shows excess emission above the extrapolated\ntrend from earlier dates, foremost in J and H, and the blueward, cyclical\nprogression in its near-IR colors is accelerated. The near-IR color evolution\nis strongly correlated with the periastron passages. After correcting for the\nsecular trend we find that the color evolution matches an apparent increase in\nblackbody temperature of an optically thick near-IR emitting plasma component\nfrom about 3500 to 6000 K over the last 20 years. Conclusions. We suggest that\nthe changing near-IR emission may be caused by variability in optically thick\nbremsstrahlung emission. Periastron passages play a key role in the observed\nexcess near-IR emission after 1998 and the long-term color evolution. We thus\npropose as a hypothesis that angular momentum transfer (via tidal acceleration)\nduring periastron passages leads to sudden changes in eta Car's atmosphere\nresulting in a long-term decrease in the mass-loss rate. \n\n"}

One\npossibility is that gas in atomic cooling halos exposed to strong Lyman-Werner\n(LW) radiation forms $10^4-10^6 ~ M_\\odot$ supermassive stars which quickly\ncollapse into black holes. We propose a scenario for direct collapse black hole\n(DCBH) formation based on synchronized pairs of pristine atomic cooling halos.\nWe consider halos at very small separation with one halo being a subhalo of the\nother. The first halo to surpass the atomic cooling threshold forms stars. Soon\nafter these stars are formed, the other halo reaches the cooling threshold and\ndue to its small distance from the newly formed galaxy, is exposed to the\ncritical LW intensity required to form a DCBH. The main advantage of this\nscenario is that synchronization can potentially prevent photoevaporation and\nmetal pollution in DCBH-forming halos. Since the halos reach the atomic cooling\nthreshold at nearly the same time, the DCBH-forming halo is only exposed to\nionizing radiation for a brief period. Tight synchronization could allow the\nDCBH to form before stars in the nearby galaxy reach the end of their lives and\ngenerate supernovae winds.

In this work we simulate the evolution of europium in our galaxy with\nthe inhomogeneous chemical evolution model 'ICE', and compare our results with\nspectroscopic observations. We test the most important parameters affecting the\nchemical evolution of Eu: (a) for neutron star mergers the coalescence time\nscale of the merger ($t_{\\mathrm{coal}}$) and the probability to experience a\nneutron star merger event after two supernova explosions occurred and formed a\ndouble neutron star system ($P_{\\mathrm{NSM}}$) and (b) for the sub-class of\nmagneto-rotationally driven supernovae (\"Jet-SNe\"), their occurrence rate\ncompared to standard supernovae ($P_{\\mathrm{Jet-SN}}$).

We show that the properties of\nthe calcium-rich gap transients agree well with the predictions of the tidal\ndetonation model. Under the predictions of this model, we use a follow-up X-ray\nobservation of one of these transients, SN 2012hn, to place weak upper limits\non the detonator mass of this system that include all intermediate-mass BHs\n(IMBHs). As these transients are preferentially in the stellar haloes of\ngalaxies, we discuss the possibility that these transients are tidal\ndetonations of WDs caused by random flyby encounters with IMBHs in dwarf\ngalaxies or globular clusters. This possibility has been already suggested in\nthe literature but without connection to the calcium-rich gap transients. In\norder for the random flyby cross-section to be high enough, these events would\nhave to be occurring inside these dense stellar associations. However, there is\na lack of evidence for IMBHs in these systems, and recent observations have\nruled out all but the very faintest dwarf galaxies and globular clusters for a\nfew of these transients.

Finally, we outline several new observational tests of this scenario,\nwhich are feasible with current instrumentation. \n\n"}

We fill this gap by\nperforming an optimization and statistical analysis of all the low-energy\nconstants (LECs) up to next-to-next-to-leading order. Our optimization protocol\ncorresponds to a simultaneous fit to scattering and bound-state observables in\nthe pion-nucleon, nucleon-nucleon, and few-nucleon sectors, thereby utilizing\nthe full model capabilities of chiEFT. We study the effect on other observables\nby demonstrating error-propagation methods that can easily be adopted by future\nworks. We employ mathematical optimization and implement automatic\ndifferentiation to attain efficient and machine-precise first- and second-order\nderivatives of the objective function with respect to the LECs. We use\npower-counting arguments to estimate the systematic uncertainty that is\ninherent to chiEFT and we construct chiral interactions at different orders\nwith quantified uncertainties. Statistical error propagation is compared with\nMonte Carlo sampling showing that statistical errors are in general small\ncompared to systematic ones.

It is generally accepted that these jets are powered\nelectromagnetically, by the magnetised rotation of a central compact object.\nHowever, how they produce the observed emission and survive the propagation for\nmany orders of magnitude in distance without being disrupted by current-driven\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities is the subject of active debate. We carry out\ntime-dependent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic,\nPoynting flux dominated jets. The jets are launched self-consistently by the\nrotation of a strongly magnetised central compact object. This determines the\nnatural degree of azimuthal magnetic field winding, a crucial factor that\ncontrols jet stability. We find that the jets are susceptible to two types of\ninstability: (i) a global, external kink mode that grows on long time scales\nand causes the jets to bodily bend sideways. Whereas this mode does not cause\njet disruption over the simulated distances, it substantially reduces jet\npropagation speed. We show, via an analytic model, that the growth of the\nexternal kink mode depends on the slope of the ambient medium density profile.\nIn flat density distributions characteristic of galactic cores, an AGN jet may\nstall, whereas in stellar envelopes the external kink weakens as the jet\npropagates outward; (ii) a local, internal kink mode that grows over short time\nscales and causes small-angle magnetic reconnection and conversion of about\nhalf of jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat. Based on the robustness and\nenergetics of the internal kink mode, we suggest that this instability is the\nmain dissipation mechanism responsible for powering GRB prompt emission. \n\n"}

The\nfate of this dense wind material is important for models of second generation\nstar formation in massive star clusters. Mackey et al. (2014) showed that\nexternal photoionization can stall the wind of RSGs and accumulate mass in a\ndense static shell. We use 1D R-HD simulations of an externally photoionized\nwind to predict the Halpha and [NII] emission arising from photoionized winds\nboth with and without a dense shell. We analyse spectra of the Halpha and [NII]\nemission in the environment around W26 and compare them with predicted\nsynthetic emission. Simulations of slow winds that are decelerated into a dense\nshell show strongly limb-brightened line emission, with line radial velocities\nthat are independent of the wind speed. Faster winds (>22 km/s) do not form a\ndense shell, have less limb-brightening, and the line radial velocity is a good\ntracer of the wind speed. The brightness of the [NII] and Halpha lines as a\nfunction of distance from W26 agrees reasonably well with observations when\nonly the line flux is considered. The radial velocity disagrees, however: the\nbrightest observed emission is blueshifted by ~25 km/s relative to the radial\nvelocity of the star, whereas a spherically symmetric wind has the brightest\nemission at zero radial velocity.

We obtain a lower limit on\nthe nitrogen abundance within the nebula of 2.35 times solar.

Massive haloes have a high clustering because they reside\nin high density regions. Small haloes can be found in a wide range of\nenvironments which determine their clustering amplitudes differently. This\ncontradicts the assumption of standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD)\nmodels that the bias and occupation of haloes is determined solely by their\nmass.

Abstract: Astrometry covers a parameter space that cannot be reached by RV or transit\nmethods to detect terrestrial planets on wide orbits. In addition, high\naccuracy astrometric measurements are necessary to measure the inclination of\nthe planet's orbits. Here we investigate the principles of an artefact of the\nastrometric approach. Namely, the displacement of the photo-centre due to\ninhomogeneities in a dust disc around the parent star. Indeed, theory and\nobservations show that circumstellar discs can present strong asymmetries. We\nmodel the pseudo-astrometric signal caused by these inhomogeneities, asking\nwhether a dust clump in a disc can mimic the astrometric signal of an\nEarth-like planet. We show that these inhomogeneities cannot be neglected when\nusing astrometry to find terrestrial planets. We provide the parameter space\nfor which these inhomogeneities can affect the astrometric signals but still\nnot be detected by mid-IR observations. We find that a small cross section of\ndust corresponding to a cometary mass object is enough to mimic the astrometric\nsignal of an Earth-like planet. Astrometric observations of protoplanetary\ndiscs to search for planets can also be affected by the presence of\ninhomogeneities. Some further tests are given to confirm whether an observation\nis a real planet astrometric signal or an impostor. Eventually, we also study\nthe case where the cross section of dust is high enough to provide a detectable\nIR-excess and to have a measurable photometric displacement by actual\ninstruments such as Gaia, IRAC or GRAVITY. We suggest a new method, which\nconsists in using astrometry to quantify asymmetries (clumpiness) in inner\ndebris discs that cannot be otherwise resolved. \n\n"}

With net vertical field aligned with disk rotation, the Hall-shear\ninstability strongly amplifies horizontal magnetic field, making the overall\ndynamics dependent on initial field configuration. Following disk formation,\nthe disk likely relaxes into an inner zone characterized by asymmetric field\nconfiguration across the midplane that smoothly transitions to a more symmetric\nouter zone. Angular momentum transport is driven by both MHD winds and laminar\nMaxwell stress, with both accretion and decretion flows present at different\nheights, and modestly asymmetric winds from the two disk sides. With\nanti-aligned field polarity, weakly magnetized disks settle into an asymmetric\nfield configuration with supersonic accretion flow concentrated at one side of\ndisk surface, and highly asymmetric winds between the two disk sides. In all\ncases, the wind is magneto-thermal in nature characterized by mass loss rate\nexceeding the accretion rate. More strongly magnetized disks give more\nsymmetric field configuration and flow structures. Deeper far-UV penetration\nleads to stronger and less stable outflows.

In\nthe meeting The Impact of Binaries on Stellar Evolution (ESO Garching, July\n3-7, 2017), both in the opening and the summary talks the speakers mentioned\nthat \"Textbooks need most likely to be rewritten\". I made my point that some\nnew chapters were already written, although researchers do not read them but\nrather keep referring to the `old textbooks'. For example, too many speakers\nand authors keep referring only to the single degenerate and double degenerate\nscenarios for the progenitors of SNe Ia. Researchers must refer also to the\n`new textbook chapter' on the core degenerate (CD) scenario. Other examples\ninvolve the role of jets. Jets lead to a new evolutionary phase, that of the\ngrazing envelope evolution (GEE), that should be considered alongside the older\nones, e.g., the common envelope evolution, Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), and wind\nmass loss and accretion. I discuss how the GEE can solve some puzzling binary\nsystems. We should also consider the role of jets as an extra energy source to\nremove the common envelope and in powering intermediate luminosity optical\ntransients (ILOTs).

In the case of known pulsars a fully coherent\nsearch, based on matched filtering, which uses the position and rotational\nparameters obtained from electromagnetic observations, can be carried out.\nMatched filtering maximizes the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, but a large\nsensitivity loss is expected in case of even a very small mismatch between the\nassumed and the true signal parameters.

Until\nrecently, it was believed that proportional electroluminescence was fully due\nto VUV emission of noble gas excimers produced in atomic collisions with\nexcited atoms, the latter being in turn produced by drifting electrons. In this\nwork we consider an additional mechanism of proportional electroluminescence,\nnamely that of bremsstrahlung of drifting electrons scattered on neutral atoms\n(so-called neutral bremsstrahlung); it is systemically studied here both\ntheoretically and experimentally. In particular, the absolute EL yield has for\nthe first time been measured in pure gaseous argon in the two-phase mode, using\na dedicated two-phase detector with EL gap optically read out by cryogenic PMTs\nand SiPMs. We show that the neutral bremsstrahlung effect can explain two\nintriguing observations in EL radiation: that of the substantial contribution\nof the non-VUV spectral component, extending from the UV to NIR, and that of\nthe photon emission at lower electric fields, below the Ar excitation\nthreshold. Possible applications of neutral bremsstrahlung effect in two-phase\ndark matter detectors are discussed. \n\n"}
{"id": "1803.06094", "contents": "Title: Turbulence, Accretion Braking Torques and Efficient Jets Without\n  Magnetocentrifugal Acceleration: Core Concepts Abstract: I discuss three mutually-supportive notions or assumptions regarding jets and\naccretion. The first is magnetocentrifugal acceleration (MCA), the\noverwhelmingly favored mechanism for the production of jets in most steady\naccreting systems. The second is the zero-torque inner boundary condition. The\nthird is that effective viscous dissipation is like real dissipation, leading\ndirectly to heating. All three assumptions fit nicely together in a manner that\nis simple, persuasive, and mutually-consistent. All, I argue, are incorrect.\nFor concreteness I focus on protostars. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in\naccretion is not a sink of energy, but a reservoir, capable of doing mechanical\nwork directly and therefore efficiently, rather than solely through ohmic\n(\"viscous\") heating. Advection of turbulence energy reduces the effective\nradiative efficiency, and may help solve the missing boundary-layer emission\nproblem. The angular momentum problem, whereby accretion spins up a protostar\nto breakup, is resolved by allowing direct viscous coupling to the protostar,\npermitting substantially greater energy to be deposited into the accretion flow\nthan otherwise possible. This goes not into heat, but into a turbulent,\ntangled, buoyant toroidal magnetic field. I argue that there is neither an\nangular momentum problem nor an efficiency problem that MCA is needed to solve.\nMoreover, the turbulent magnetic field has ample ability not just to collimate\nbut to accelerate gas, first radially inwards through tension forces and then\nvertically through pressure forces, without any MCA mechanism. I suggest then\nthat jets, particularly the most powerful and well-collimated protostellar\njets, are not magnetocentrifugally driven. \n\n"}

This work aims at exploring what our state-of-the-art theories of\nstellar evolution combined with those of stellar atmospheres predict about a\ncertain type of metal-poor (0.02 Z$_{\\odot}$) hot massive stars, the chemically\nhomogeneously evolving ones, called TWUIN stars.\n  Methods. Synthetic spectra corresponding to a broad range in masses (20-130\nM$_{\\odot}$) and covering several evolutionary phases from the zero-age\nmain-sequence up to the core helium-burning stage were computed.\n  Results. We find that TWUIN stars show almost no emission lines during most\nof their {core hydrogen-burning} lifetimes. Most metal lines are completely\nabsent, including nitrogen. During their core helium-burning stage, lines\nswitch to emission and even some metal lines (oxygen and carbon, but still\nalmost no nitrogen) show up. Mass loss and clumping play a significant role in\nline-formation in later evolutionary phases, particularly during core\nhelium-burning. Most of our spectra are classified as an early O type giant or\nsupergiant, and we find Wolf-Rayet stars of type WO in the core helium-burning\nphase.\n  Conclusions. An extremely hot, early O type star observed in a\nlow-metallicity galaxy could be the outcome of chemically homogeneous evolution\n$-$ and therefore the progenitor of a long-duration gamma-ray burst or a type\nIc supernova. TWUIN stars may play an important role in reionizing the Universe\ndue to their being hot without showing prominent emission lines during the\nmajority of their lifetimes. \n\n"}

Turbulence may develop in a GRB jet as the result of\nhydrodynamic or current-driven instabilities. The jet carries dense radiation\nand the turbulence cascade can be damped by Compton drag, passing kinetic fluid\nenergy to photons through scattering. We identify two regimes of turbulence\ndissipation: (1) \"Viscous\" - the turbulence cascade is Compton damped on a\nscale $\\ell_{\\rm damp}$ greater than the photon mean free path $\\ell_\\star$.\nThen turbulence energy is passed to photons via bulk Comptonization by smooth\nshear flows on scale $\\ell_\\star<\\ell_{\\rm damp}$. (2) \"Collisionless\" - the\ncascade avoids Compton damping and extends to microscopic plasma scales much\nsmaller than $\\ell_\\star$. The collisionless dissipation energizes plasma\nparticles, which radiate the received energy; how the dissipated power is\npartitioned between particles needs further investigation with kinetic\nsimulations. We show that the dissipation regime switches from viscous to\ncollisionless during the jet expansion, at a critical value of the jet optical\ndepth which depends on the amplitude of turbulence.

We investigate the\ndetectability of tidal deformation in short-period planets from their transit\nlight curves and the instrumental precision needed. We show how the detection\nof deformation from the light curve allows us to obtain an observational\nestimate of the second fluid Love number which gives valuable insight about the\nplanet's internal structure. We adopted a model to calculate the shape of a\nplanet due to the external potentials acting on it and used this model to\nmodify the ellc transit tool. Our model is parameterized by the Love number,\nhence for a given light curve we can derive the value of the Love number that\nbest matches the observations. We simulated the known cases of WASP-103b and\nWASP-121b expected to be highly deformed. Our analyses showed that instrumental\nprecision $\\leq$50ppm/min is needed to reliably estimate the Love number and\ndetect tidal deformation. This precision can be achieved for WASP-103b in ~40\ntransits using HST and in ~300 transits using the forthcoming CHEOPS.

The unprecedented\nprecisions expected from PLATO and JWST can permit the detection of deformation\nwith a single transit. However, the effects of instrumental and astrophysical\nnoise must be well-considered as they can increase the number of transits\nrequired to reach the 50 ppm/min detection limit.

We find that in order to reproduce the\napparently rapid increase in the ratio of S0 galaxies to ellipticals in the\nclusters, our model requires that: (1) galaxy accretion rate has to be high\n(typically, more than half of the present-day cluster population must have been\naccreted since z~0.5), and (2) most of the accreted spirals, with morphological\ntypes as late as Scdm, must have transformed to S0's.

We argue that dissipation in 2D is\nrepresentative of that in three dimensions as long as it is dominated by shocks\nrather than by a turbulent cascade. Energy is injected at a few isolated sites\nin space, over relatively small scales, and over short time periods. This leads\nto the coexistence of forced and decaying regimes in the same flow. We find\nthat the ISM-like flow dissipates its turbulent energy rapidly. In simulations\nwith forcing, the input parameters are the radius l_f of the forcing region,\nthe total kinetic energy e_k each source deposits into the flow, and the rate\nof formation of those regions, sfr_OB. The global dissipation time t_d depends\nmainly on l_f. In terms of measurable properties of the ISM, t_d >= Sigma_g\nu_rms^2/(e_k sfr_OB), where Sigma_g is the average gas surface density and\nu_rms is the rms velocity dispersion. For the solar neighborhood, t_d >=\n1.5x10^7 yr. The global dissipation time is consistently smaller than the\ncrossing time of the largest energy-containing scales.

Detection of the companion is possible\nbecause the flux of the companion can be highly amplified when it crosses the\nlens caustic. The detection is facilitated since the companion is more\namplified than the primary because it, in general, has a smaller size than the\nprimary, and thus experiences less finite source effect.

Out of about 600 pointed RXTE\nobservations, the source was found to exhibit such state transition only on 16\noccasions. An examination of the RXTE/ASM data in conjunction with the pointed\nobservations reveals that these events appeared as a series of quasi-regular\ndips in two stretches of long duration (about 20 days during each occasions)\nwhen hard X-ray and radio flux were very low. The X-ray light curve and\ncolor-color diagram of the source during these observations are found to be\ndifferent from any reported so far. The duration of these dips is found to be\nof the order of a few tens of seconds with a repetition time of a few hundred\nseconds. The transition between these dips and non-dips which differ in\nintensity by a factor of ~ 3.5, is observed to be very fast (~ a few seconds).\nIt is observed that the low-frequency narrow QPOs are absent in the power\ndensity spectrum (PDS) of the dip and non-dip regions of class $\\omega$ and the\nPDS is a power law in 0.1 - 10 Hz frequency range.

In the near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams\nprovided by the 2MASS and DENIS surveys, the LMC C-type stars draw a striking\nred tail, well separated from the sequences of O-rich giants. So far, this\nconspicuous feature has been absent from any set of available isochrones, even\nthe few existing ones that include the TP-AGB evolution of low- and\nintermediate-mass stars.

The simulations provide quite a detailed\ndescription of the several vertical fingers and inclined sequences seen in\n2MASS data, due to both Galactic foreground and LMC O-rich stars. Instead, as\nmentioned, the red tail of C-stars sets a major difficulty: we find that TP-AGB\nmodels with solar-scaled molecular opacities, the usual assumption of existing\nAGB calculations, do not succeed in reproducing this feature. Our tests\nindicate that the main reason for this failure should not be ascribed to\nempirical Teff - (J-K) transformations for C-type stars. Instead, the\ndiscrepancy is simply removed by adopting new evolutionary models that account\nfor the changes in molecular opacities as AGB stars get enriched in carbon via\nthe third dredge-up (Marigo 2002). In fact, simulations that adopt these models\nare able to reproduce, for the first time, the red tail of C-stars in\nnear-infrared CMDs. Finally, we point out that these simulations also provide\nuseful indications about the efficiency of the third dredge-up process, and the\npulsation modes of long-period variables. \n\n"}

We show new evidence,\nbased on the combined statistics of Lyman alpha and beta absorption in quasar\nspectra, that the IGM contains a significant amount of neutral hydrogen, and is\nexperiencing rapid ionization around redshift z=6. However, we argue that\nquasar BHs, even faint ones that are below the detection thresholds of existing\noptical surveys, are unlikely to drive the evolution of the neutral fraction\naround this epoch, because they would over-produce the present-day soft X-ray\nbackground. On the other hand, the seeds of the quasar BHs around z=6 likely\nappeared at much earlier epochs (around z=20), and produced hard ionizing\nradiation by accretion. These early BHs are promising candidates to account for\nthe high redshift ionization (around z=15) implied by the recent cosmic\nmicrowave anisotropy data from WMAP.

As a modern version, the redshift evolution of total star\nformation rate (SFR) in clusters has been actively debated recently. However,\nthese studies of redshift trend have been always hampered by the possible mass\ndependence; due to the observational selection effects, clusters found at\nhigher redshift inevitably tend to be more massive and luminous than local\ncounterparts. Consequently, one has to correct for the mass trend before\ninterpreting the redshift trend.\n  As an attempt to break this degeneracy, we investigate the mass dependence of\nblue/late-type fractions and total SFR of 115 clusters at $z\\leq 0.09$ selected\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

{"id": "astro-ph/0505183", "contents": "Title: Scaling variability from stellar to supermassive black holes Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between the variability seen in the stellar\nand supermassive black holes. Galactic Black Hole (GBH) power density spectra\n(PDS) are generally complex, and dependent on spectral state. In the low/hard\nstate the high-frequency rollover in the PDS moves in a way which is not simply\nrelated to luminosity. Hence this feature can only be used as an approximate\nindicator rather than as an accurate tracer of black hole mass in AGN. The\nX-ray spectrum in the high/soft state is dominated by the disc in GBH, which is\nrather stable. We show that the PDS of the Comptonized tail in GBH can be much\nmore variable, and that it is this which should be compared to AGN due to their\nmuch lower disc temperature. This bandpass effect removes a problem in\ninterpreting the (often highly variable) Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies\nas the counterparts of the high mass accretion rate GBH. Additionally, we\nspeculate that some NLS1 (e.g. Akn 564) are counterparts of the very high\nstate. The Comptonized tail in this state is also highly variable, but with PDS\nwhich can be roughly described as band-limited noise. This shape is similar to\nthat seen in the low/hard state, so merely seeing such band-limited noise in\nthe power spectrum of an AGN does not necessarily imply low luminosity. We also\nstress that Cyg X-1, often used for comparison with AGN, is not a typical black\nhole system due to its persistent nature. In particular, the shape of its power\nspectrum in the high/soft state is markedly different from that of other\n(transient) GBH systems in this state. The fact that the NLS1s NGC 4051 and\nMCG-6-30-15 do appear to show a power spectrum similar to that of the high/soft\nstate of Cyg X-1 may lend observational support to theoretical speculation that\nthe Hydrogen ionization disc instability does not operate in AGN. \n\n"}

The XRT continued\nto observe the burst for 7.1 days and detect it for 1.4 days. The X-ray light\ncurve showed a classic decay pattern; the afterglow was too faint for a jet\nbreak to be detected. No optical, infrared or ultraviolet counterpart was\ndiscovered despite deep searches within 14 hours of the burst. Two particular\nfeatures of the prompt emission make GRB 050717 a very unusual burst. First,\nthe peak of the nu Fnu spectrum was observed to be 2401(-568/+781) keV for the\nmain peak, which is the highest value of Epeak ever observed. Secondly, the\nspectral lag for GRB 050717 was determined to be 2.5 +- 2.6 ms, consistent with\nzero and unusually short for a long burst. This lag measurement suggests that\nthis burst has a high intrinsic luminosity and hence is at high redshift (z >\n2.7). Despite these unusual features GRB 050717 exhibits the classic prompt and\nafterglow behaviour of a gamma-ray burst. \n\n"}

We use multi-wavelength afterglow data to understand the temporal and\nspectral decay properties with superimposed variability of this high redshift\nburst. Five telescopes were used to study the decaying afterglow of GRB 050730\nin the B, V, r', R, i', I, J and K photometric pass bands. A spectral energy\ndistribution was constructed at 2.9 hours post-burst in the K, J, I, R, V and B\nbands.

The early afterglow shows\nvariability at early times and shows a steepening at ~0.1 days (8.6 ks) in the\nB, V, r', R, i', I, J and K passbands. The early afterglow light curve decayed\nwith alpha_1 = -0.60+/-0.07 and alpha_2 = -1.71+/-0.06 based on R and I band\ndata.

In closed-box numerical simulations, the effect of the turbulent Mach\nnumber $\\Ms$ depends on whether the turbulence is driven or decaying: In driven\nregimes, increasing $\\Ms$ decreases the SFE, while in decaying regimes the\nconverse is true. The efficiencies in non-magnetic cases for realistic Mach\nnumbers $\\Ms \\sim 10$ are somewhat too high compared to observed values.\nIncluding the magnetic field can bring the SFE down to levels consistent with\nobservations, but the intensity of the magnetic field necessary to accomplish\nthis depends again on whether the turbulence is driven or decaying. In this\nkind of simulations, a lifetime of the molecular cloud (MC) needs to be\nassumed. Further progress requires determining the true nature of the\nturbulence driving and the lifetimes of the clouds. Simulations of MC formation\nby large-scale compressions in the warm neutral medium (WNM) show that the\nclouds' initial turbulence is produced by the accumulation process that forms\nthem, and that the turbulence is driven for as long as this process lasts,\nproducing realistic velocity dispersions and also thermal pressures in excess\nof the mean WNM value. In simulations including self-gravity, but neglecting\nthe magnetic field and stellar energy feedback, the clouds never reach an\nequilibrium state, but rather evolve secularly, increasing their mass and\ngravitational energy until they engage in generalized gravitational collapse.\nHowever, local collapse events begin midways through this process, and produce\nenough stellar objetcs to disperse the cloud or at least halt its collapse\nbefore the latter is completed. \n\n"}

The tails have\na complex morphology, in particular when the cluster approaches its\napogalacticon, showing multiple ``arms'' in remarkable similarity to the\nstructures observed around NGC 288 and Willman 1.

In the framework of this statistical model it is shown that the\nexperimentally observed equality of $K^+$ and $K^-$ rates at\n``threshold-corrected'' energies $\\sqrt{s} - \\sqrt{s_{th}}$ is due to a\ncrossing of two excitation functions.

The observed maximum in the $K^+/\\pi^+$ excitation\nfunction is also seen in the ratio of strange to non-strange particle\nproduction.

In particular, the average transverse\nmomentum of the J/Psi will exhibit a non-monotonic behavior in the progression\nfrom p-p to p-A to A-A interactions. \n\n"}

Collective degrees of freedom\ngovern essential aspects of nuclear structure, and for several decades the\nstudy of collective modes such as rotations and vibrations has played a vital\nrole in our understanding of complex properties of nuclei. The multipole\nresponse of unstable nuclei and the possible occurrence of new exotic modes of\nexcitation in weakly-bound nuclear systems, present a rapidly growing field of\nresearch, but only few experimental studies of these phenomena have been\nreported so far. Valuable data on the evolution of the low-energy dipole\nresponse in unstable neutron-rich nuclei have been gathered in recent\nexperiments, but the available information is not sufficient to determine the\nnature of observed excitations. Even in stable nuclei various modes of giant\ncollective oscillations had been predicted by theory years before they were\nobserved, and for that reason it is very important to perform detailed\ntheoretical studies of the evolution of collective modes of excitation in\nnuclei far from stability. We therefore discuss the modern theoretical tools\nthat have been developed in recent years for the description of collective\nexcitations in weakly-bound nuclei. The review focuses on the applications of\nthese models to studies of the evolution of low-energy dipole modes from stable\nnuclei to systems near the particle emission threshold, to analyses of various\nisoscalar modes, those for which data are already available, as well as those\nthat could be observed in future experiments, to a description of\ncharge-exchange modes and their evolution in neutron-rich nuclei, and to\nstudies of the role of exotic low-energy modes in astrophysical processes. \n\n"}

The implications for ``anomalous'' $J/\\psi$ suppression\nobserved in Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS are discussed.

Attaining the target sensitivity requires maintaining an electric field\nof several tens of kilovolts per centimeter across the experimental cell, which\nis nominally 7.5 cm wide and will contain about 4 liters of superfluid. The\nelectrical properties of liquid helium are expected to be sufficient to meet\nthe design goals, but little is known about these properties for volumes and\nelectrode spacings appropriate to the EDM experiment. Furthermore, direct\napplication of the necessary voltages from an external source to the\nexperimental test cell is impractical. An apparatus to amplify voltages in the\nliquid helium environment and to test the electrical properties of the liquid\nfor large volumes and electrode spacings has been constructed. The device\nconsists of a large-area parallel plate capacitor immersed in a 200 liter\nliquid helium dewar. Preliminary results show the breakdown strength of normal\nstate liquid helium is at least 90 kV/cm at these volumes, at the helium vapor\npressure corresponding to 4.38 K. These fields hold for more than 11 hours with\nleakage currents less than 170 pA (about 20% of the maximum tolerable in the\nEDM experiment).

Preliminary results for superfluid show that fields of\nat least 30 kV/cm can be sustained at the volumes required for the EDM\nexperiment, about 60% of the design goal. These results are likely limited by\nthe low pressure that must be maintained above the superfluid bath. \n\n"}
