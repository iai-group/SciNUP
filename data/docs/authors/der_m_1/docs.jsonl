The detector seems to be composed by two parts: a small\nvolume around the HV contact where charges are efficiently collected as at\nhigher voltage, and a large volume where charges are poorly collected. A\nqualitative explanation of this behavior is presented. An event-by-event pulse\nshape analysis based on A/E (maximum amplitude of the current pulse over the\ntotal energy released in the detector) has been applied to events in different\nenergy regions and found very effective in rejecting non localized events. In\nconclusion, BEGe detectors are excellent candidates for the second phase of\nGERDA, an experiment devoted to neutrinoless double beta decay of Ge-76. \n\n"}

The\nLong-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) represents an extensively developed\nplan for a world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions. LBNE\nis conceived around three central components: (1) a new, high-intensity\nneutrino source generated from a megawatt-class proton accelerator at Fermi\nNational Accelerator Laboratory, (2) a near neutrino detector just downstream\nof the source, and (3) a massive liquid argon time-projection chamber deployed\nas a far detector deep underground at the Sanford Underground Research\nFacility. This facility, located at the site of the former Homestake Mine in\nLead, South Dakota, is approximately 1,300 km from the neutrino source at\nFermilab -- a distance (baseline) that delivers optimal sensitivity to neutrino\ncharge-parity symmetry violation and mass ordering effects.

SuperKEKB is designed to deliver an instantaneous luminosity\n$\\mathcal{L}=8\\times10^{35}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The experiment\nwill therefore have to cope with a much larger machine background than its\npredecessor Belle, in particular from events outside of the interaction region.\nWe present the concept of a track trigger, based on a neural network approach,\nthat is able to suppress a large fraction of this background by reconstructing\nthe $z$ (longitudinal) position of the event vertex within the latency of the\nfirst level trigger. The trigger uses the hit information from the Central\nDrift Chamber (CDC) of Belle II within narrow cones in polar and azimuthal\nangle as well as in transverse momentum (\"sectors\"), and estimates the\n$z$-vertex without explicit track reconstruction. The preprocessing for the\ntrack trigger is based on the track information provided by the standard CDC\ntrigger. It takes input from the 2D track finder, adds information from the\nstereo wires of the CDC, and finds the appropriate sectors in the CDC for each\ntrack. Within the sector, the $z$-vertex is estimated by a specialized neural\nnetwork, with the drift times from the CDC as input and a continuous output\ncorresponding to the scaled $z$-vertex. The neural algorithm will be\nimplemented in programmable hardware. To this end a Virtex 7 FPGA board will be\nused, which provides at present the most promising solution for a fully\nparallelized implementation of neural networks or alternative multivariate\nmethods. A high speed interface for external memory will be integrated into the\nplatform, to be able to store the $\\mathcal{O}(10^9)$ parameters required.

However, limited by absorption\ncoefficients, X-rays cannot deeply penetrate materials such as copper and lead.\nHere we show via simulation that muon beams can provide high resolution\ntomographic images of dense objects and of structures within the interior of\ndense objects. The effects of resolution broadening from multiple scattering\ndiminish with increasing muon momentum. As the momentum of the muon increases,\nthe contrast of the image goes down and therefore requires higher resolution in\nthe muon spectrometer to resolve the image. The variance of the measured muon\nmomentum reaches a minimum and then increases with increasing muon momentum.\nThe impact of the increase in variance is to require a higher integrated muon\nflux to reduce fluctuations. The flux requirements and level of contrast needed\nfor high resolution muon computed tomography are well matched to the muons\nproduced in the pion decay pipe at a neutrino beam facility and what can be\nachieved for momentum resolution in a muon spectrometer.

In measurements of\nthe basic weak muon capture reaction on the proton to determine the\npseudoscalar coupling g_P, capture occurs from both atomic and molecular\nstates. Thus knowledge of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ is required for a correct\ninterpretation of these experiments.\n  Purpose: Recently the MuCap experiment has measured the capture rate\n\\Lambda_S from the singlet p\\mu\\ atom, employing a low density active target to\nsuppress pp\\mu\\ formation (PRL 110, 12504 (2013)). Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm\nof argon, a competing process to pp\\mu\\ formation was introduced, which allowed\nthe extraction of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ from the observed time distribution of decay\nelectrons.\n  Results: The pp\\mu\\ formation rate was measured as \\lambda_pp\\mu = (2.01 +-\n0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1.

HPXe chambers are capable\nof imaging electron tracks, a feature that enhances the separation between\nsignal events (the two electrons emitted in the 0nbb decay of 136Xe) and\nbackground events, arising chiefly from single electrons of kinetic energy\ncompatible with the end-point of the 0nbb decay (Qbb ). Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction. Due to electron multiple scattering, this\nstrategy is not perfectly efficient on an event-by-event basis, but a\nstatistical estimator can be constructed which can be used to reject background\nevents by one order of magnitude at a moderate cost (approx. 30%) in signal\nefficiency.

In spite of its large cross section, the\nCEvNS process has never been observed, due to tiny energies of the resulting\nnuclear recoils which are out of reach for standard neutrino detectors. The\nmeasurement of CEvNS has now become feasible, thanks to the development of\nultra-sensitive technology for rare decay and weakly-interacting massive\nparticle (dark matter) searches. The CEvNS cross section is cleanly predicted\nin the standard model; hence its measurement provides a standard model test. It\nis relevant for supernova physics and supernova-neutrino detection, and enables\nvalidation of dark-matter detector background and detector-response models. In\nthe long term, precision measurement of CEvNS will address questions of nuclear\nstructure. COHERENT will deploy multiple detector technologies in a phased\napproach: a 14-kg CsI[Na] scintillating crystal, 15 kg of p-type point-contact\ngermanium detectors, and 100 kg of liquid xenon in a two-phase time projection\nchamber.

For\nthis purpose we provide a set of Monte-Carlo simulation results of electron\nbackscattering on a silicon detector with a thin golden window with realistic\nelectric and magnetic fields in the spectrometer. We have found that the\nprobability of such an effect reaches up to 20-30\\%. The scattered electron\ncould be reflected backwards to the detector by electrostatic field or by\nmagnetic mirror. There is also a few percent probability to escape from the\nspectrometer through its entrance. A time delay between the scattering moment\non the detector and the return of the reflected electron can reach a couple of\nmicroseconds in the Troitsk spectrometer. Such estimations are critical for the\nplanning upgrades of the detector and the registration electronics. \n\n"}

To this end, U-229 nuclei are doped into VUV-transparent\ncrystals, where they undergo alpha decay into Th-229, and, with a probability\nof 2%, populate the isomeric state. These Th-229m nuclei may decay into the\nnuclear ground state under emission of the sought-after VUV gamma, whose\nwavelength can be determined with a spectrometer.

A\ngating grid prevents ions produced during the gas amplification from moving\ninto the drift volume. The maximum drift time of the electrons together with\nthe closure time of the gating grid allows a maximum readout rate of about 3\nkHz. After the Long Shutdown 2 (from 2021 onwards), the LHC will provide\nlead-lead collisions at an expected interaction rate of 50 kHz. To take data at\nthis rate the TPC will be upgraded with new readout chambers, allowing for\ncontinuous read-out and preserving the energy and momentum resolution of the\ncurrent MWPCs.\n  Chambers with a stack of four Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) fulfil all the\nperformance requirements, if the voltages applied to the GEMs are tuned\nproperly. In order to ensure that these chambers are stable while being\noperated at the LHC, studies of the discharge behaviour were performed.

The energy deposited in a ZDC fluctuates from one\nevent to another, but on average it is proportional to the number of absorbed\nnucleons. Forward nucleons are also emitted in electromagnetic dissociation\n(EMD) of nuclei in ultraperipheral collisions, and they are used to monitor the\nluminosity. As known, ZDC energy spectra are specific to each facility, because\nthey are affected by the ZDC acceptance, and the ZDC energy resolution depends\non the beam energy. In this work a simple combinatorial model leading to handy\nformulas has been proposed to connect the numbers of emitted and detected\nforward nucleons taking into account a limited ZDC acceptance.

We demonstrate stabilization of a field of\n14.6 mT to 4.3 nT rms noise (0.29 ppm), compared to noise of $\\gtrsim$ 100 nT\nwithout any stabilization.

A superfluid helium target has\nseveral advantageous properties, including a light nuclear mass for better\nkinematic matching with light dark matter particles, copious production of\nscintillation light, extremely good intrinsic radiopurity, a high impedance to\nexternal vibration noise, and a unique mechanism for observing phonon-like\nmodes via liberation of $^4$He atoms into a vacuum (`quantum evaporation'). In\nthis concept, both scintillation photons and triplet excimers are detected\nusing calorimeters, including calorimeters immersed in the superfluid. Kinetic\nexcitations of the superfluid medium (rotons and phonons) are detected using\nquantum evaporation and subsequent atomic adsorption onto a microcalorimeter\nsuspended in vacuum above the target helium. The energy of adsorption amplifies\nthe phonon/roton signal before calorimetric sensing, producing a gain mechanism\nthat can reduce the techonology's recoil energy threshold below the calorimeter\nenergy threshold. We describe signal production and signal sensing\nprobabilities, and estimate electron recoil discrimination. We then simulate\nradioactive backgrounds from gamma rays and neutrons.

Despite the recent experimental successes, a predictive model to\ndescribe the detection event in these detectors is needed to optimize the\ndetection metrics. Here, we propose a probabilistic criterion for single-photon\ndetection based on single-vortex (flux quanta) crossing the width of the\nnanowire. Our model makes a connection between the dark-counts and\nphoton-counts near the detection threshold. The finite-difference calculations\ndemonstrate that a change in the bias current distribution as a result of the\nphoton absorption significantly increases the probability of single-vortex\ncrossing even if the vortex potential barrier has not vanished completely. We\nestimate the instrument response function and show that the timing uncertainty\nof this vortex tunneling process corresponds to a fundamental limit in timing\njitter of the click event. We demonstrate a trade-space between this intrinsic\n(quantum) timing jitter, quantum efficiency, and dark count rate in TaN, WSi,\nand NbN superconducting nanowires at different experimental conditions.

This method provides the\nneeded selectivity for the early emitted photons, since the photons emitted at\nlater times correlate over progressively narrower momentum scales.

A 2R-MHSP/MHSP\ncascaded multiplier operated at a total gain of ~10^5, yielded an ion back-flow\nfraction of 0.003. We discuss the concept for trapping back-flowing ions in\nthese cascaded multipliers and the relevance to gaseous photomultiplier and TPC\napplications; directions for further future developments are outlined. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/0702188", "contents": "Title: The X-ray Telescope of CAST Abstract: The Cern Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) is in operation and taking data since\n2003. The main objective of the CAST experiment is to search for a hypothetical\npseudoscalar boson, the axion, which might be produced in the core of the sun.\nThe basic physics process CAST is based on is the time inverted Primakoff\neffect, by which an axion can be converted into a detectable photon in an\nexternal electromagnetic field. The resulting X-ray photons are expected to be\nthermally distributed between 1 and 7 keV. The most sensitive detector system\nof CAST is a pn-CCD detector combined with a Wolter I type X-ray mirror system.\nWith the X-ray telescope of CAST a background reduction of more than 2 orders\noff magnitude is achieved, such that for the first time the axion photon\ncoupling constant g_agg can be probed beyond the best astrophysical constraints\ng_agg < 1 x 10^-10 GeV^-1. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/9812027", "contents": "Title: Taber Vibration Isolator for Vacuum and Cryogenic Applications Abstract: We present a procedure for the design and construction of a passive,\nmultipole, mechanical high-stop vibration isolator. The isolator, consisting of\na stack of metal disks connected by thin wires, attenuates frequencies in the\nkilohertz range, and is suited to both vacuum and cryogenic environments. We\nderive an approximate analytical model and compare its predictions for the\nfrequencies of the normal modes to those of a finite element analysis. The\nanalytical model is exact for the modes involving only motion along and\nrotation about the longitudinal axis, and it gives a good approximate\ndescription of the transverse modes. These results show that the high-frequency\nbehavior of a multi-stage isolator is well characterized by the natural\nfrequencies of a single stage. From the single-stage frequency formulae, we\nderive relationships among the various geometrical parameters of the isolator\nto guarantee equal attenuation in all degrees of freedom. We then derive\nexpressions for the attenuation attainable with a given isolator length, and\nfind that the most important limiting factor is the elastic limit of the spring\nwire material. For our application, which requires attenuations of 250 dB at 1\nkHz, our model specifies a six-stage design using brass disks of approximately\n2 cm in both radius and thickness, connected by 3 cm steel wires of diameters\nranging from 25 to 75 microns. We describe the construction of this isolator in\ndetail, and compare measurements of the natural frequencies of a single stage\nwith calculations from the analytical model and the finite element package. For\ntranslations along and rotations about the longitudinal axes, all three results\nare in agreement to within 10% accuracy. \n\n"}
