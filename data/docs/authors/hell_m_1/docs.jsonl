One of the well-known examples is\nthe resonant enhancement of the transmission known as Breit-Wigner resonances,\nwhich can be described by a Lorentzian function. But, in many physical systems\nthe scattering of waves involves propagation along different paths, and, as a\nconsequence, results in interference phenomena, where constructive interference\ncorresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference to resonant\nsuppression of the transmission. Recently, a variety of experimental and\ntheoretical work has revealed such patterns in different branches of physics.\nThe purpose of this Review is to demonstrate that this kind of resonant\nscattering is related to the Fano resonances, known from atomic physics. One of\nthe main features of the Fano resonances is the asymmetric profile. The\nasymmetry comes from the close coexistence of resonant transmission and\nresonant reflection.

This method is applicable in\nsituations where previous methods are not, such as nonuniform loops, rings with\nlarge width to radius ratio and loops with large coherence length to perimeter\nratio.

Recently, fast gate operations have been demonstrated in logical\nspin qubits composed of two electron spins where the rapid exchange of the two\nelectrons permits electrically controllable rotations around one axis of the\nqubit. However, universal control of the qubit requires arbitrary rotations\naround at least two axes. Here we show that by subjecting each electron spin to\na magnetic field of different magnitude we achieve full quantum control of the\ntwo-electron logical spin qubit with nanosecond operation times. Using a single\ndevice, a magnetic field gradient of several hundred milliTesla is generated\nand sustained using dynamic nuclear polarization of the underlying Ga and As\nnuclei. Universal control of the two-electron qubit is then demonstrated using\nquantum state tomography. The presented technique provides the basis for single\nand potentially multiple qubit operations with gate times that approach the\nthreshold required for quantum error correction. \n\n"}

Recent discoveries, enabled by sophisticated\nfabrication, have uncovered new phenomena that completely change our\nunderstanding of transport in these devices, especially the role of the spin\nand valley degrees of freedom. This review describes the modern understanding\nof transport through nanotube devices.\n  Unlike conventional semiconductors, electrons in nanotubes have two angular\nmomentum quantum numbers, arising from spin and from valley freedom. We focus\non the interplay between the two. In single quantum dots defined in short\nlengths of nanotube, the energy levels associated with each degree of freedom,\nand the spin-orbit coupling between them, are revealed by Coulomb blockade\nspectroscopy. In double quantum dots, the combination of quantum numbers\nmodifies the selection rules of Pauli blockade.

The authors of the experiment have observed\nan unexpected behavior of phase coherence, that saturates at high energies\ninstead of vanishing, presumably suggesting the relaxation of a wave packet to\nthe ground state before it arrives to the MZ interferometer. Here, we\ntheoretically investigate this situation using the model of edge states [I. P.\nLevkivskyi, E. V. Sukhorukov, Phys. Rev.

Arrays of semiconductor quantum dots and ultracold atoms\nheld in optical lattices, provide two means of studying coherent quantum\ntransport in well-controlled systems. In this work we study how to induce\nlong-range transfer between the two ends of a dimer chain, by coupling states\nthat are localized just on the chain's end-points. This has the appealing\nfeature that the transfer occurs only between the end-points -- the particle\ndoes not pass through the intermediate sites -- making the transfer less\nsusceptible to decoherence. We first show how a repulsively bound-pair of\nfermions, known as a doublon, can be transferred from one end of the chain to\nthe other via topological edge states. We then show how non-topological surface\nstates of the familiar Shockley or Tamm type can be used to produce a similar\nform of transfer under the action of a periodic driving potential. Finally we\nshow that combining these effects can produce transfer by means of more exotic\ntopological effects, in which the driving field can be used to switch the\ntopological character of the edge states, as measured by the Zak phase. Our\nresults demonstrate how to induce long range transfer of strongly correlated\nparticles by tuning both topology and driving. \n\n"}

In the regime of strongest competition between\nthe Kondo effect and proximity effect, meaning that the Kondo temperature\nequals the superconducting gap, the magnetic state of the dot undergoes a first\norder quantum transition induced by the superconducting phase difference across\nthe junction.

What will happen if strong interaction is introduced to this\nsystem? Will the interaction wash out the characteristic features of Weyl\nsemimetals such as the Hall response?

Such\ndifficulties have stimulated new research paradigms, such as ultra-cold atom\nlattices for simulating quantum materials. Here we report on the realization of\nintrinsic unconventional superconductivity in a 2D superlattice created by\nstacking two graphene sheets with a small twist angle. For angles near\n$1.1^\\circ$, the first `magic' angle, twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) exhibits\nultra-flat bands near charge neutrality, which lead to correlated insulating\nstates at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping away from these correlated\ninsulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical\ntemperature $T_c$ up to 1.7 K. The temperature-density phase diagram shows\nsimilarities with that of the cuprates, including superconducting domes.\nMoreover, quantum oscillations indicate small Fermi surfaces near the\ncorrelated insulating phase, in analogy with under-doped cuprates.

Then, for the special case of two-band systems, we show that the\ninter-band contribution to the effective band mass of a particle at a given\nquantum state is directly controlled by the quantum metric of the corresponding\nstate.
