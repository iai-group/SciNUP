High-sensitivity microwave surface\nimpedance measurements of the in-plane penetration depth in single crystals of\nelectron-doped PrFeAsO1-y (y~0.1) and hole-doped Ba1-xKxFe2As2 (x~0.55) are\npresented. In clean crystals of Ba1-xKxFe2As2, as well as in PrFeAsO1-y\ncrystals, the penetration depth shows flat temperature dependence at low\ntemperatures, indicating that the superconducting gap opens all over the Fermi\nsurface. The temperature dependence of superfluid density in both systems is\nmost consistent with the existence of two different gaps. In Ba1-xKxFe2As2, we\nfind that the superfluid density is sensitive to degrees of disorder inherent\nin the crystals, implying unconventional impurity effect. We also determine the\nlower critical field $H_{c1}$ in PrFeAsO1-y by using an array of micro-Hall\nprobes. The temperature dependence of $H_{c1}$ saturates at low temperatures,\nfully consistent with the superfluid density determined by microwave\nmeasurements. The anisotropy of $H_{c1}$ has a weak temperature dependence with\nsmaller values than the anisotropy of upper critical fields at low\ntemperatures, which further supports the multi-gap superconductivity in\nFe-arsenide systems. The quasiparticle conductivity shows an enhancement in the\nsuperconducting state, which suggests the reduction of quasiparticle scattering\nrate due to the gap formation below $T_c$.

The energy spectrum of this field accounts for the tendency of\nhole-doped cuprates to form stripe-like inhomogeneities.

This theory correctly describes the\nobserved phase diagram of the cuprates, including the non-Fermi-liquid to FL\ncrossover in the normal state, the existence of Fermi arcs below T^* and of a\n\"marginal-FL\" critical behavior above it.

The\nderived phase diagram shows that charge stripe order (CO) coexists with bulk\nsuperconductivity in a broad range of doping around x=1/8, although the CO\norder parameter falls off quickly for x<>1/8. Except for x=0.155, the onset of\nCO always coincides with the transition between the orthorhombic and the\ntetragonal low temperature structures. The CO transition evolves from a sharp\ndrop at low x to a more gradual transition at higher x, eventually falling\nbelow the structural phase boundary for optimum doping. With respect to the\ninterlayer CO correlations, we find no qualitative change of the stripe\nstacking order as a function of doping, and in-plane and out-of-plane\ncorrelations disappear simultaneously at the transition. Similarly to the CO,\nthe spin stripe order (SO) is also most pronounced at x=1/8.

In these lecture notes for an international school, I emphasize that even\nthough the low energy properties of a phase of matter are generally emergent\nand entirely determined by the broken symmetry, there are many differences\nbetween a strongly correlated and a weakly correlated state of matter. For\nexample, spin waves are an emergent property for antiferromagnets, but for weak\ncorrelations the normal phase of a (Slater) antiferromagnet is metallic,\nwhereas it is insulating (Heisenberg) for strong correlations. As a function of\ninteraction strength, above the antiferromagnetic phase, the crossover between\na metal and a local moment paramagnetic insulator is described by the Mott\ntransition, whose mean-field theory down to T=0 is best formulated with\ndynamical mean-field theory. A similar situation occurs for superconductors:\ndespite similar emergent properties, there are many differences between both\nkinds of superconductors. Experimental evidence suggests that hole-doped\ncuprates are strongly correlated whereas the correlations are weaker in the\nelectron-doped case, especially near optimal doping. Evidence for a pseudogap\narising from antiferromagnetic fluctuations is strong in the latter case,\nwhereas in the hole-doped case the pseudogap temperature appears as a\nconsequence of Mott physics.

Due to small number of\ncarriers in this band, the quasiclassical Werthamer-Helfand approximation\nbreaks down and Landau quantization has to be taken into account. We found that\nthe transition temperature TC2(H) has giant oscillations and is resonantly\nenhanced at the magnetic fields corresponding to full occupancy of the Landau\nlevels in the shallow band. This enhancement is especially pronounced for the\nlowest Landau level. As a consequence, the reentrant superconducting regions in\nthe temperature-field phase diagram emerge at low temperatures near the\nmagnetic fields at which the chemical potential matches the Landau levels.

We solve the linearized Eliashberg\nequation by taking into account the full momentum-frequency dependence of the\norder parameter for the spin-triplet and the spin-singlet states, and estimate\nthe transition temperature as a function of the Coulomb integrals. The\neffective pairing interaction is expanded perturbatively with respect to the\nCoulomb interaction at the Ru sites up to the third order. As a result, we show\nthat the spin-triplet p-wave state is more stable than the spin-singlet d-wave\nstate for moderately strong Coulomb interaction.

We have studied this in the\none-band and three-band Hubbard Model. From partially occupied orbitals one\nobtains pair eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with no on-site repulsion (the W=0\npairs). The concept of W=0 pairs allows to make qualitative and quantitative\npredictions about the behaviour of interacting many-body systems, a quite\nremarkable and unusual situation.

After reviewing our work on the interplay among Tc,\nhole content, and pressure in the bilayered and multilayered cuprate\nsuperconductors, we will discuss how the proximity to an electronic topological\ntransition (ETT) may give a microscopic justification of the ``intrinsic''\npressure dependence of Tc in the cuprates.

Abstract: It is well known that copper-based perovskite oxides rightly enjoy consensus\nas high-temperature superconductors on the basis of two signatures: Meissner\neffect and zero resistance. In contrast, I provide over twenty signatures for\nroom temperature superconductivity in carbon nanotubes. The one-dimensionality\nof the nanotubes complicates the right-of-passage for prospective\nquasi-one-dimensional superconductors. The Meissner effect is less visible\nbecause the diameters of nanotubes are much smaller than the penetration depth.\nZero resistance is less obvious because of the quantum contact resistance and\nsignificant quantum phase slip, both of which are associated with a finite\nnumber of transverse conduction channels. Nonetheless, on-tube resistance at\nroom temperature has been found to be indistinguishable from zero for many\nindividual multi-walled nanotubes.

We\nobserve that the pairing is enhanced when the single-electron level around\n(pi,0) is close to the Fermi level E_F, while the d-wave pairing interaction\nitself contains elements to disfavor the pairing due to shift of the\n(pi,0)-level. Angle-resolved photoemission results in the cuprates are\nconsistently explained in the presence of the d-wave pairing interaction. Our\nproposal is the tuning of the (pi,0)-level under the many-body effects to E_F\nby optimal design of band structure. \n\n"}
{"id": "cond-mat/9908233", "contents": "Title: Is There a Unified Description of Conductivity of Layered Cuprates ? Abstract: We present a novel approach to the analysis of the normal state in-plane\n$\\sigma_{ab}$ and out-of-plane $\\sigma_{c}$ conductivities of anisotropic\nlayered crystals such as oxygen deficient $YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x}$. It can be shown\nthat the resistive anisotropy is determined by the ratio of the phase coherence\nlengths in the respective directions; i.e.,\n$\\sigma_{ab}/\\sigma_c=\\ell_{ab}^2/\\ell_c^2$. From the idea that at all doping\nlevels and temperatures $T$ the out-of-plane transport in these crystals is\nincoherent, follows that $\\ell_c$ is T-independent, equal to the spacing\n$\\ell_0$ between the neighboring bilayers. Thus, the T-dependence of\n$\\ell_{ab}$ is given by the measured anisotropy, and $\\sigma_{ab}(\\ell_{ab})$\ndependence is obtained by plotting $\\sigma_{ab}$ vs\n$\\ell=(\\sigma_{ab}/\\sigma_c)^{1/2}\\ell_0$. The analysis of several single\ncrystals of $YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x}$ ($6.35<x<6.93$) shows that for all of them\n$\\sigma_{ab}(\\ell)$ is described by a universal dependence\n$\\sigma_{ab}/\\bar\\sigma =f(\\ell/\\bar\\ell)$ with doping dependent parameters\n$\\bar\\sigma$ and $\\bar\\ell$. \n\n"}

At low\ntemperatures, both of them were found to be positive with a linear\nmagnetic-field dependence above a threshold field, a result not expected from\nelectronic band theory. We argue that such behavior is a manifestation of a\nnovel coherent state characterized by a spin pseudo gap in the quasi-particle\nexcitation spectrum in Sr2RuO4. \n\n"}
