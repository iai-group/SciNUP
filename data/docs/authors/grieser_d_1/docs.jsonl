My strong interest in the above theorem is motivated by the fact\nthat it contradicts some of my isospectrality examples constructed on geodesic\nspheres and balls of certain harmonic manifolds. The authors overlooked that\nthe Lichnerowicz identity is not determined by the given spectral data, and so\nis the final crucial equation obtained by eliminating with the Lichnerowicz\nidentity. In short, the above theorem has falsely been established by\nspectrally undetermined identities which can not be computed (determined) by\nthe spectra of local geodesic spheres. More complicated spectrally undetermined\nfunctions cause the problems also in case of local geodesic balls. I describe\nalso a strong physical argument which clearly explains why the manifolds\nappearing in my examples are isospectral. It must be pointed out, however, that\na very remarkable new idea, namely, the asymptotic expansion of the heat\ninvariants $a_k(p,r)$ defined on geodesic spheres, $S_p(r)$, is introduced in\nthe paper.

This approach gives\nfor instance a new proof of the existence of a Willmore minimizing embedding of\nan arbitrary closed surface in arbitrary codimension. We explain how the same\napproach can solve constraint minimization problems for the Willmore\nfunctional. We show in particular that, for a given closed surface and a given\nconformal class for this surface, there is an immersion in $R^m$, away possibly\nfrom isolated branched points, which minimizes the Willmore energy among all\npossible Lipschitz immersions in $R^m$ having an $L^2-$bounded second\nfundamental form and realizing this conformal class. This branched immersion is\neither a smooth Conformal Willmore branched immersion or an isothermic branched\nimmersion. We show that branched points do not exist whenever the minimal\nenergy in the conformal class is less than $8\\pi$ and that these immersions\nextend to smooth conformal Willmore embeddings or global isothermic embeddings\nof the surface in that case.

The first main result\nstates that the boundary measurements uniquely determine a mixed Fourier\ntransform / attenuated geodesic ray transform (or integral against a more\ngeneral semiclassical limit measure) of an unknown coefficient. In particular,\none obtains uniqueness results whenever the geodesic ray transform on the\ntransversal manifold is injective. The second result shows that the boundary\nmeasurements in an infinite cylinder uniquely determine the transversal metric.\nThe first result is proved by using complex geometrical optics solutions\ninvolving Gaussian beam quasimodes, and the second result follows from a\nconnection between the Calderon problem and Gel'fand's inverse problem for the\nwave equation and the boundary control method. \n\n"}

However, it is still not\nwell-understood; for example, existence of solutions to the conformal equations\nfor zero or negative Yamabe metrics is still unknown without the so-called\n``CMC'' or ``near-CMC'' assumptions. The first existence results without such\nassumptions, termed the ``far-from-CMC'' case, were obtained by Holst, Nagy,\nand Tsogtgerel in 2008 for positive Yamabe metrics. However, their results are\nbased on topological arguments, and as a result solution uniqueness is not\nknown. Indeed, Maxwell gave evidence in 2011 that far-from-CMC solutions are\nnot unique in certain cases. In this article, we provide further insight by\nestablishing a type of alternative theorem for general far-from-CMC solutions.\nFor a given manifold M that admits a metric of positive scalar curvature and\nscalar flat metric g(0) with no conformal Killing fields, we first prove\nexistence of an analytic, one-parameter family of metrics g(z) through g(0)\nsuch that R(g(z)) = z. Using this family of metrics and given data\n(tau,sigma,rho,j), we form a one-parameter family of operators F((phi,w),z)\nwhose zeros satisfy the conformal equations. Applying Liapnuov-Schmidt\nreduction, we determine an analytic solution curve for F((phi,w),z) = 0 through\na critical point where the linearization of F((phi,w),z) vanishes. The\nregularity of this curve, the definition of F((phi,w),z), and the earlier\nfar-from-CMC results of Holst et al. allow us to then prove the following\nalternative theorem for far-from-CMC solutions: either (1) there exists a z_1\n>0 such that (positive Yamabe) solutions to the z_1-parameterized conformal\nequations are non-unique; or (2) there exists z_2 < 0 such that (negative\nYamabe) solutions to the z_2-parameterized conformal equations exist. \n\n"}

Although the conformal method is successful in\ngenerating constant mean curvature (CMC) solutions of the constraint equations,\nit is unknown how well it applies in the non-CMC setting, and there have been\nindications that it encounters difficulties there. We are therefore motivated\nto investigate alternative generalizations of the CMC conformal method.\n  Introducing a densitized lapse into the ADM Lagrangian, we find that\nsolutions of the momentum constraint can be described in terms of three\nparameters. The first is conformal momentum as it appears in the standard\nconformal method. The second is volumetric momentum, which appears as an\nexplicit parameter in the CMC conformal method, but not in the non-CMC\nformulation. We have called the third parameter drift momentum, and it is the\nconjugate momentum to infinitesimal motions in superspace that preserve\nconformal class and volume form up to independent diffeomorphisms. This\ndecomposition of solutions of the momentum constraint leads to extensions of\nthe CMC conformal method where conformal and volumetric momenta both appear as\nparameters. There is more than one way to treat drift momentum, in part because\nof an interesting duality that emerges, and we identify three candidates for\nincorporating drift into a variation of the conformal method. \n\n"}

It is shown\nthat, arbitrarily fixing the initial scalar field, the set of the initial\nconformal metrics on the outgoing null cone such that the maximal future\ndevelopment does not have any sequences of closed trapped surfaces approaching\nthe singularity, is of first category in the whole space in which the shear\ntensors are continuous.

The\niteration limits are pairs $(X, \\mu)$ where $X$ is a compact subset of $\\br^d$,\n(the support of $\\mu$) and the measure $\\mu$ is a probability measure\ndetermined uniquely by the initial IFS mappings, and a certain strong\ninvariance axiom.

II Abstract: Let $(M^\\circ, g)$ be an asymptotically conic manifold, in the sense that\n$M^\\circ$ compactifies to a manifold with boundary $M$ in such a way that $g$\nbecomes a scattering metric on $M$. A special case of particular interest is\nthat of asymptotically Euclidean manifolds, where $\\partial M = S^{n-1}$ and\nthe induced metric at infinity is equal to the standard metric. We study the\nresolvent kernel $(P + k^2)^{-1}$ and Riesz transform of the operator $P =\n\\Delta_g + V$, where $\\Delta_g$ is the positive Laplacian associated to $g$ and\n$V$ is a real potential function $V$ that is smooth on $M$ and vanishes to some\nfinite order at the boundary.\n  In the first paper in this series we made the assumption that $n \\geq 3$ and\nthat $P$ has neither zero modes nor a zero-resonance and showed (i) that the\nresolvent kernel is conormal to the lifted diagonal and polyhomogeneous at the\nboundary on a blown up version of $M^2 \\times [0, k_0]$, and (ii) the Riesz\ntransform of $P$ is bounded on $L^p(M^\\circ)$ for $1 < p < n$, and that this\nrange is optimal unless $V \\equiv 0$ and $M^\\circ$ has only one end.
