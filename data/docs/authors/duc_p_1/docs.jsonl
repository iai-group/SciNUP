Furthermore, it allows for a satisfactory anthropic explanation\nof the cosmological constant problem by producing a smooth, and approximately\nconstant, distribution of potentially observable values of Lambda. The low\nenergy vacua selected by this measure are often short lived. If we require\nanthropically acceptable vacua to have a minimum life-time of 10 billion years,\nthen for reasonable parameters a typical observer should expect their vacuum to\nhave a life-time of approximately 12 billion years.

{"id": "0706.3744", "contents": "Title: The Imprint of Cosmic Reionization on Galaxy Clustering Abstract: We consider the effect of reionization on the clustering properties of galaxy\nsamples at intermediate redshifts (z~0.3-5.5). Current models for the\nreionization of intergalactic hydrogen predict that overdense regions will be\nreionized early, thus delaying the build up of stellar mass in the progenitors\nof massive lower-redshift galaxies. As a result, the stellar populations\nobserved in intermediate redshift galaxies are somewhat younger and hence\nbrighter in overdense regions of the Universe. Galaxy surveys would therefore\nbe sensitive to galaxies with a somewhat lower dark matter mass in overdense\nregions. The corresponding increase in the observed number density of galaxies\ncan be parameterized as a galaxy bias due to reionization. We model this\nprocess using merger trees combined with a stellar synthesis code. Our model\ndemonstrates that reionization has a significant effect on the clustering\nproperties of galaxy samples that are selected based on their star-formation\nproperties. The bias correction in Lyman-break galaxies (including those in\nproposed baryonic oscillation surveys at z<1) is at the level of 10-20% for a\nhalo mass of 10^12 solar masses, leading to corrections factors of 1.5-2 in the\nhalo mass inferred from measurements of clustering length. The reionization of\nhelium could also lead to a sharp increase in the amplitude of the galaxy\ncorrelation function at z~3. We find that the reionization bias is\napproximately independent of scale and halo mass. However since the traditional\ngalaxy bias is mass dependent, the reionization bias becomes relatively more\nimportant for lower mass systems. The correction to the bias due to\nreionization is very small in surveys of luminous red galaxies at z<1. \n\n"}

Both long term X-ray light curves, X-ray spectra, the rapid\nX-ray variability and the radio jet behaviour are consistent with a model where\na standard outer accretion disc is truncated at low luminosities, being\nreplaced by a hot, inner flow which also acts as the launching site of the jet.\nDecreasing the disc truncation radius leads to softer spectra, as well as\nhigher frequencies (including QPO's) in the power spectra, and a faster jet.\nThe collapse of the hot flow when the disc reaches the last stable orbit\ntriggers the dramatic decrease in radio flux, as well as giving a qualitative\n(and often quantitative) explanation for the major hard--soft spectral\ntransition seen in black holes and neutron stars.\n  After collapse of the hot inner flow, the spectrum in black hole systems can\nbe dominated by the disc emission.

This campaign detected new outbursts of five known X-ray transients\nand discovered two new systems. Their 2-10 keV peak luminosities range from\n1E34 to 6E36 erg/s. Two of the sources discussed in this paper are confirmed\nneutron star systems (AX J1745.6-2901 and GRS 1741-2853), while the five others\nhave an unknown nature. We discuss the characteristics of the observed\noutbursts and the duty cycles of the various systems. Several of the detected\ntransients seem to undergo enhanced X-ray activity with levels intermediate\nbetween quiescence and full outburst. We discuss the possibility that the\nsubluminous appearance of the eclipsing X-ray burster AX J1745.6-2901 is due to\nline-of-sight effects. We detected two type-I X-ray bursts with a duration of\n50-60 seconds from AX J1745.6-2901, which we discuss in view of the bursting\nbehavior of low-luminosity X-ray transients.

We\napply this to the broadband Swift data from the outburst of the black hole\nbinary XTE J1817--330 to confirm previous results that the optical/UV emission\nin the soft state is consistent with a reprocessing a constant fraction of the\nbolometric X-ray luminosity. However, this is very surprising as the disc\ntemperature drops by more than a factor 3 in the soft state, which should\nproduce a marked change in the reprocessing efficiency. The easiest way to\nmatch the observed constant reprocessed fraction is for the disc skin to be\nhighly ionized (as suggested 30 years ago by van Paradijs), so that the bulk of\nthe disc flux is reflected and only the hardest X-rays heat the disc. The\nconstant reprocessed fraction also favours direct illumination of the disc over\na scattering origin as the optical depth/solid angle of any scattering material\n(wind/corona) over the disc should decrease as the source luminosity declines.\nBy contrast, the reprocessed fraction increases very significantly (by a factor\n~6) as the source enters the hard state.

The g,r,i colors of LRGs\nare inconsistent with stellar population models over the redshift range\n0.1<z<0.7. The g-r colors in the models are on average redder than the data\nwhile the r-i colors in the models are bluer towards low redshift. Beyond\nredshift 0.4, the predicted r-i color becomes instead too red, while the\npredicted g-r agrees with the data. We provide a solution to this problem,\nthrough a combination of new astrophysics and a fundamental change to the\nstellar population modeling. We find that the use of the empirical library of\nPickles (1998) instead of theoretical spectra modifies the predicted colors\nexactly in the way suggested by the data. The reason is a lower flux in the\nempirical libraries, with respect to the theoretical ones, in the wavelength\nrange 5500-6500 AA. The discrepancy increases with decreasing effective\ntemperature independently of gravity. This result has general implications for\na variety of studies from globular clusters to high-redshift galaxies.

The impacts of interaction on galaxy properties are detected at\nleast out to the neighbor separation corresponding to the virial radius of\ngalaxies, which is typically between 200 and 400 h^{-1}kpc for the galaxies in\nour sample. To detect these long-range interaction effects it is crucial to\ndivide galaxy interactions into four cases dividing the morphology of target\nand neighbor galaxies into early and late types. We show that there are two\ncharacteristic neighbor-separation scales where the galaxy interactions cause\nabrupt changes in the properties of galaxies. The first scale is the virial\nradius of the nearest neighbor galaxy r_{vir,nei}. Many physical parameters\nstart to deviate from those of extremely isolated galaxies at the projected\nneighbor separation r_p of about r_{vir,nei}. The second scale is at r_p\n\\approx 0.05 r_{vir,nei} = 10--20 h^{-1} kpc, and is the scale at which the\ngalaxies in pairs start to merge. We find that late-type neighbors enhance the\nstar formation activity of galaxies while early-type neighbors reduce it, and\nthat these effects occur within r_{vir,nei}. The hot halo gas and cold disk gas\nmust be participating in the interactions at separations less than the virial\nradius of the galaxy plus dark halo system. Our results also show that the role\nof the large-scale density in determining galaxy properties is minimal once\nluminosity and morphology are fixed. We propose that the weak residual\ndependence of galaxy properties on the large-scale density is due to the\ndependence of the halo gas property on the large-scale density. \n\n"}

Similar\ninstabilities occur in resonance rings and tidal tails. Sequential triggering\nfrom stellar pressure occurs in two ways. For short times and near distances,\nit occurs in the bright rims and dense knots that lag behind during cloud\ndispersal. For long times, it occurs in swept-up shells and along the periphery\nof cleared regions. The first case should be common but difficult to\ndisentangle from independent star formation in the same cloud. The second case\nhas a causality condition and a collapse condition and is often easy to\nrecognize. Turbulent triggering produces a hierarchy of dense cloudy structure\nand an associated hierarchy of young star positions. There should also be a\ncorrelation between the duration of star formation and the size of the region\nthat is analogous to the size-linewidth relation in the gas. The cosmological\ncontext is provided by observations of star formation in high redshift\ngalaxies.

In three dimensions, for the practical value N=3, the number of\nFFTs required is 20. We apply the method to the measurement of the power\nspectrum of a periodic point distribution that is a local Poisson realization\nof an underlying stationary field. We derive explicit analytic expression for\nthe spectrum, which allows us to quantify--and correct for--the biases induced\nby discreteness and by the truncation of the Taylor expansion, and to bound the\nunknown effects of aliasing of the power spectrum. We show that these aliasing\neffects decrease rapidly with the order N.

The analytical calculations are successfully\nchecked against a cosmological N-body experiment. We also consider the initial\nconditions of this simulation, which correspond to a perturbed grid.

The\nreductions are more significant at lower redshifts, lower halo masses, and\nminor mergers. Our approach agrees better with predictions from the EPS model.\nSecond, we find that the FOF halo finder overestimates the halo mass by up to\n50% for halos that are about to merge, which leads to an additional ~20%\noverestimate of the merger rate. Therefore, we define halo masses by including\nonly gravitationally bound particles. We provide new best-fitting parameters\nfor a global formula to account for these improvements. In addition, we extract\nthe merger rate per progenitor halo, as well as per descendant halo. The former\nis the quantity that is related to observed galaxy merger fractions when they\nare measured via pair counting. At low mass/redshift the merger rate increases\nwith mass and redshift. At high mass/redshift (for halos with masses a few\ntimes the \"knee\" of the mass function) these trends break down, and the merger\nrate per progenitor halo decreases with mass and increases only moderately with\nredshift.

Models and model\n  results Abstract: Different compositions of galaxy types in the field in comparison to galaxy\nclusters as described by the morphology-density relation in the local universe\nis interpreted as a result of transformation processes from late- to early-type\ngalaxies. This interpretation is supported by the Butcher-Oemler effect.\n  We investigate E+A galaxies as an intermediate state between late-type\ngalaxies in low density environments and early-type galaxies in high density\nenvironment to constrain the possible transformation processes. For this\npurpose we model a grid of post-starburst galaxies by inducing a burst and/or a\nhalting of star formation on the normal evolution of spiral galaxies with our\ngalaxy evolution code GALEV.\n  From our models we find that the common E+A criteria exclude a significant\nnumber of post-starburst galaxies and propose that comparing their spectral\nenergy distributions leads to a more sufficient method to investigate\npost-starbust galaxies. We predict that a higher number of E+A galaxies in the\nearly universe can not be ascribed solely to a higher number of starburst, but\nis a result of a lower metallicity and a higher burst strength due to more gas\ncontent of the galaxies in the early universe. We find that even galaxies with\na normal evolution without a starburst have a Hdelta-strong phase at early\ngalaxy ages. \n\n"}

Massive stars in\nnewly formed or primordial globular clusters could have played an important\nrole during the epoch of cosmological reionisation (z>~6) as sources of\nenergetic, neutral hydrogen ionising UV photons. We investigate whether or not\nthese stars could have been as important in death as sources of energetic X-ray\nphotons as they were during their main sequence lives. Most massive stars are\nexpected to form in binaries, and an appreciable fraction of these (as much as\n~30%) will evolve into X-ray luminous (L_X~10^38 erg/s) high-mass X-ray\nbinaries (HMXBs). These sources would have made a contribution to the X-ray\nbackground at z>~6. Using Monte Carlo models of a globular cluster, we estimate\nthe total X-ray luminosity of a population of HMXBs. We compare and contrast\nthis with the total UV luminosity of the massive stars during their main\nsequence lives. For reasonable estimates, we find that the bolometric\nluminosity of the cluster peaks at ~10^42 erg/s during the first few million\nyears, but declines to ~10^41 erg/s after ~5 million years as the most massive\nstars evolve off the main sequence. From this time onwards, the total\nbolometric luminosity is dominated by HMXBs and falls gradually to ~10^40 erg/s\nafter ~50 million years. Assuming a power-law spectral energy distribution for\nthe HMXBs, we calculate the effective number of neutral hydrogen ionisations\nper HMXB and show that HMXBs can be as important as sources of ionising\nradiation as massive stars. Finally we discuss the implications of our results\nfor modelling galaxy formation at high redshift and the prospects of using\nglobular clusters as probes of reionisation. \n\n"}

It is generally believed that these sub-clumps merge and form a\nyoung star cluster. The time-scale of this merging process is crucial for the\nevolution and the possible survival of the final star cluster. The key issue is\nwhether this merging process happens faster than the time needed to remove the\nresidual gas of the cloud. A merging time-scale shorter than the gas-removal\ntime would enhance the survival chances of the resulting star cluster. In this\npaper we show by means of numerical simulations that the time-scale of the\nmerging is indeed very fast. Depending on the details of the initial sub-clump\ndistribution, the merging may occur before the gas is expelled from the\nnewly-formed cluster either via supernovae or the winds from massive stars. Our\nsimulations further show that the resulting merger-objects have a higher\neffective star formation efficiency than the overall star forming region and\nconfirm the results that mass-segregated sub-clumps form mass-segregated\nmerger-objects. \n\n"}

We discuss the possibility and theoretical aspects\nof using Lyman alpha emission properties of long GRB host galaxies as a\nmetallicity indicator of high redshift GRB environments, where direct\nmetallicity measurements are not easy. We propose to use the fraction of\nLy-alpha emitters (LAEs) in long GRB host galaxies as a function of UV\nluminosity, which can be compared with star-formation-rate weighted LAE\nfraction of Lyman-break galaxies as the standard in the case of no metallicity\ndependence. There are two important effects of metallicity dependence of long\nGRB rate to change the LAE fraction of host galaxies. One is the enhancement of\nintrinsic Ly-alpha equivalent width (EW) by stronger ionizing UV luminosity of\nlow metallicity stellar population, and the other is extinction by interstellar\ndust to change the observable EW. Based on a latest theoretical model of LAEs\nthat reproduce observations, we argue that the latter is likely to work in the\nopposite direction to the former, i.e., to decrease LAE fraction if GRBs\npreferentially occur in low-metallicity environments, because of the clumpy\ninter-stellar medium effect. The high LAE fraction of GRB host galaxies\nindicated by observations is quantitatively be explained by the LAE model if\nGRBs occur when Z < 0.1Z_sun, although this result is still indicative because\nof the limited statistics and theoretical uncertainties. This result\ndemonstrates that the LAE statistics of GRB hosts may give us useful\ninformation in the future. \n\n"}

We confirm that simple spectral\nmodels commonly used for the analysis and interpretation of ULXs (power-law\ncontinuum and multi-colour disc blackbody models) are inadequate in the face of\nsuch high quality data. Instead we find two near ubiquitous features in the\nspectrum: a soft excess and a roll-over in the spectrum at energies above 3keV.\nWe investigate a range of more physical models to describe these data. We find\nthat disc plus Comptonised corona models fit the data well, but the derived\ncorona is cool, and optically thick (tau ~ 5-30). We argue that these observed\ndisc temperatures are not a good indicator of the black hole mass as the\npowerful, optically thick corona drains energy from the inner disc, and\nobscures it. We estimate the intrinsic (corona-less) disc temperature, and\ndemonstrate that in most cases it lies in the regime of stellar mass black\nholes. These objects have spectra which range from those similar to the highest\nmass accretion rate states in Galactic binaries, to those which clearly have\ntwo peaks, one at energies below 1 keV (from the outer, unComptonised disc) and\none above 3 keV (from the Comptonised, inner disc). However, a few ULXs have a\nsignificantly cooler corrected disc temperature; we suggest that these are the\nmost extreme stellar mass black hole accretors, in which a massive wind\ncompletely envelopes the inner disc regions, creating a cool photosphere. We\nconclude that ULXs provide us with an observational template for the transition\nbetween Eddington and super-Eddington accretion flows, with the latter\noccupying a new ultraluminous accretion state. \n\n"}

In type 2 AGN the bolometric\nluminosity (L_b) is generally inferred from the [OIII] emission line luminosity\n(L_OIII). The key issue, in order to estimate the bolometric luminosity in\nthese AGN, is therefore to know the bolometric correction to be applied to\nL_OIII. A complication arises from the fact that the observed L_OIII is\naffected by extinction, likely due to dust within the narrow line region. The\nextinction-corrected [OIII] luminosity (L^c_OIII) is a better estimator of the\nnuclear luminosity than L_OIII. However, so far only the bolometric correction\nto be applied to the uncorrected L_OIII has been evaluated. This paper is\ndevoted to estimate the bolometric correction C_OIII=L_b/L^c_OIII in order to\nderive the Eddington ratios for the type 2 AGN in a sample of SDSS objects. We\nhave collected from the literature 61 sources with reliable estimate of both\nL^c_OIII and X-ray luminosities (L_X). To estimate C_OIII, we combined the\nobserved correlation between L^c_OIII and L_X with the X-ray bolometric\ncorrection. We found, contrary to previous studies, a linear correlation\nbetween L^c_OIII and L_X. We estimated C_OIII using the luminosity-dependent\nX-ray bolometric correction of Marconi et al.

We show that in all cases the maximum stellar surface density\nattained in the central regions of these systems is similar, Sigma_max ~ 10^11\nM_sun/kpc^2 (~20 g/cm^2), despite the fact that the systems span 7 orders of\nmagnitude in total stellar mass M_star, 5 in effective radius R_e, and have a\nwide range in effective surface density M_star/R_e^2. The surface density limit\nis reached on a wide variety of physical scales in different systems and is\nthus not a limit on three-dimensional stellar density. Given the very different\nformation mechanisms involved in these different classes of objects, we argue\nthat a single piece of physics likely determines Sigma_max.

We show that conversion has\nseveral new features which are not realized in other objects, in particular\ninterference effects (\"L- and H- wiggles\") induced by the adiabaticity\nviolation. The neutrino-neutrino scattering inside jet and inelastic neutrino\ninteractions in the envelope may produce some additional features at E > 1e4\nGeV. We study dependence of the probabilities and flavor ratios in the\nmatter-affected region on angles theta13 and theta23, on the CP-phase delta, as\nwell as on the initial flavor content and density profile of the star. We show\nthat measurements of the energy dependence of the flavor ratios will, in\nprinciple, allow to determine independently the neutrino and astrophysical\nparameters. \n\n"}

Therefore, during these phases we predict significantly higher\ntemperatures than previous analysis that assumed equilibrium.

However, for early-type galaxies V_opt \\ne V_200, with the\nexception of early-type galaxies with V_opt simeq 350 km/s. This is\ninconsistent with early-type galaxies being, in general, globally isothermal.\nFor low mass (V_opt < 250 km/s) early-types V_opt > V_maxh, indicating that\nbaryons have modified the potential well, while high mass (V_opt > 400 km/s)\nearly-types have V_opt < V_maxh. Folding in measurements of the black hole mass\n- velocity dispersion relation, our results imply that the supermassive black\nhole - halo mass relation has a logarithmic slope which varies from ~1.4 at\nhalo masses of ~10^{12} Msun/h to ~0.65 at halo masses of 10^{13.5} Msun/h.

The question from that standpoint is to identify the feedback\nsource that makes small halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where\nthe truncation in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most\nexciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery\nof a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide\nfield, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count\nin less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are\nless luminous that some star clusters. For the first time, there are empirical\nreasons to believe that there really are missing satellite galaxies in the\nLocal Group, lurking just beyond our ability to detect them, or simply\ninhabiting a region of the sky that has yet to have been surveyed. Both\nkinematic studies and completeness-correction studies seem to point to a\ncharacteristic potential well depth for satellite subhalos that is quite close\nto the mass scale where photoionization and atomic cooling should limit galaxy\nformation.

{"id": "1011.2492", "contents": "Title: Linking haloes to galaxies: how many halo properties are needed? Abstract: Recent studies emphasize that an empirical relation between the stellar mass\nof galaxies and the mass of their host dark matter subhaloes can predict the\nclustering of galaxies and its evolution with cosmic time. In this paper we\nstudy the assumptions made by this methodology using a semi-analytical model\n(SAM). To this end, we randomly swap between the locations of model galaxies\nwithin a narrow range of subhalo mass (M_infall). We find that shuffled samples\nof galaxies have different auto-correlation functions in comparison with the\noriginal model galaxies. This difference is significant even if central and\nsatellite galaxies are allowed to follow a different relation between M_infall\nand stellar mass, and can reach a factor of 2 for massive galaxies at redshift\nzero. We analyze three features within SAMs that contribute to this effect: a)\nThe relation between stellar mass and subhalo mass evolves with redshift for\ncentral galaxies, affecting satellite galaxies at the time of infall. b) The\nstellar mass of galaxies falling into groups and clusters at high redshift is\ndifferent from the mass of central galaxies at the same time. c) The stellar\nmass growth for satellite galaxies after infall can be significant and depends\non the infall redshift and the group mass. We show that the above is true for\ndiffering SAMs, and that the effect is sensitive to the treatment of dynamical\nfriction and stripping of gas in satellite galaxies. We find that by using the\nFoF group mass at redshift zero in addition to M_infall, an empirical model is\nable to accurately reproduce the clustering properties of galaxies. On the\nother hand, using the infall redshift as a second parameter does not yield as\ngood results because it is less correlated with stellar mass.

For both IMFs, the dark matter fraction increases\nwith the total mass of the galaxy (3-sigma correlation).

This early stage occurs much before the dispersal of most of the\ngas from the protoplanetary disk. Due to their different aerodynamic\nproperties, planetesimals of different sizes and shapes experience different\ndrag forces from the gas during this time. Such differential forces produce a\nwind-shearing (WISH) effect between close by, different size planetesimals. For\nany two planetesimals, a WISH radius can be considered, at which the\ndifferential acceleration due to the wind becomes greater than the mutual\ngravitational pull between the planetesimals. We find that the WISH radius\ncould be much smaller than the Hill radius, i.e. WISH could play a more\nimportant role than tidal perturbations by the star. Here we study the WISH\nradii for planetesimal pairs of different sizes and compare the effects of wind\nand gravitational shearing (drag force vs. gravitational tidal force). We then\ndiscuss the role of WISH for the stability and survival of binary\nplanetesimals. Binaries are sheared apart by the wind if they are wider than\ntheir WISH radius. WISH-stable binaries can inspiral and possibly coalesce due\nto gas drag. Here, we calculate the WISH radius and the gas drag-induced merger\ntimescale, providing stability and survival criteria for gas-embedded binary\nplanetesimals. Our results suggest that even WISH-stable binaries may merge in\ntimes shorter than the lifetime of the gaseous disk. This may constrain\ncurrently observed binary planetesimals to have formed far from the star or at\na late stage after the dispersal of most of the disk gas. We note that the WISH\nradius may also be important for other processes such as planetesimal erosion\nand planetesimal encounters and collisions in a gaseous environment. \n\n"}

Nevertheless, unresolved issues are still open in\nthe literature on the physics of the afterglow and on the GRB environment. In\nparticular, GRB 070125 was claimed to have exploded in a galactic halo\nenvironment, based on the uniqueness of the optical spectrum and the\nnon-detection of an underlying host galaxy. In this work we collect all\npublicly available data and address these issues by modelling the NIR-to-X-ray\nspectral energy distribution (SED) and studying the high signal-to-noise\nVLT/FORS afterglow spectrum in comparison with a larger sample of GRB\nabsorbers. The SED reveals a synchrotron cooling break in the UV, low\nequivalent hydrogen column density and little reddening caused by a LMC- or\nSMC-type extinction curve. From the weak MgII absorption at z=1.5477 in the\nspectrum, we derived logN(MgII)=12.96+0.13-0.18 and upper limits on the ionic\ncolumn density of several metals. These suggest that the GRB absorber is most\nlikely an LLS with a 0.03Z\\odot<Z<1.3Z\\odot metallicity. The comparison with\nother GRB absorbers places GRB070125 at the low end of the absorption line\nequivalent width distribution, confirming that weak spectral features and\nspectral-line poor absorbers are not so uncommon in afterglow spectra.\nMoreover, we show that the effect of photo-ionization on the gas surrounding\nthe GRB, combined with a low N(HI) along a short segment of the line of sight\nwithin the host galaxy, can explain the lack of spectral features in GRB070125.\nFinally, the non-detection of an underlying galaxy is consistent with a faint\nGRB host galaxy, well within the GRB host brightness distribution. Thus, the\npossibility that GRB070125 is simply located in the outskirts of a gas-rich,\nmassive star-forming region inside its small and faint host galaxy seems more\nlikely than a gas-poor, halo environment origin. \n\n"}

Our multi-wavelength follow-up\ncampaign uncovered a long-lived (duration >~ months), luminous X-ray (L_X,iso ~\n3 x 10^47 erg s^-1) and radio (nu L_nu,iso ~ 10^42 erg s^-1) counterpart. The\nassociated optical emission, however, from which we measure a redshift of\n1.1853, is relatively faint, and this is not due to a large amount of dust\nextinction in the host galaxy. Based on numerous similarities with the recently\ndiscovered GRB 110328A / Swift J164449.3+573451 (Sw J1644+57), we suggest that\nSw J2058+05 may be the second member of a new class of relativistic outbursts\nresulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. If\nso, the relative rarity of these sources (compared with the expected rate of\ntidal disruptions) implies that either these outflows are extremely narrowly\ncollimated (theta < 1 degree), or only a small fraction of tidal disruptions\ngenerate relativistic ejecta. Analogous to the case of long-duration gamma-ray\nbursts and core-collapse supernovae, we speculate that rapid spin of the black\nhole may be a necessary condition to generate the relativistic component.\nAlternatively, if powered by gas accretion (i.e., an active galactic nucleus\n[AGN]), Sw J2058+05 would seem to represent a new mode of variability in these\nsources, as the observed properties appear largely inconsistent with known\nclasses of AGNs capable of generating relativistic jets (blazars, narrow-line\nSeyfert 1 galaxies). \n\n"}

However, the lack of true\nabsorption opacity in the disc means that the emission is better approximated\nby a colour temperature corrected blackbody, and this colour temperature\ncorrection is large enough ($\\sim 2.4$) that the bare disc emission from a zero\nspin black hole can extend into the soft X-ray bandpass.

Abstract: Recently an inflationary model with a vector field coupled to the inflaton\nwas proposed and the phenomenology studied for the Bianchi type I spacetime. It\nwas found that the model demonstrates a counter-example to the cosmic no-hair\ntheorem since there exists a stable anisotropically inflationary fix-point. One\nof the great triumphs of inflation, however, is that it explains the observed\nflatness and isotropy of the universe today without requiring special initial\nconditions. Any acceptable model for inflation should thus explain these\nobservations in a satisfactory way. To check whether the model meets this\nrequirement, we introduce curvature to the background geometry and consider\naxisymmetric spacetimes of Bianchi type II,III and the Kantowski-Sachs metric.\nWe show that the anisotropic Bianchi type I fix-point is an attractor for the\nentire family of such spacetimes. The model is predictive in the sense that the\nuniverse gets close to this fix-point after a few e-folds for a wide range of\ninitial conditions. If inflation lasts for N e-folds, the curvature at the end\nof inflation is typically of order exp(-2N). The anisotropy in the expansion\nrate at the end of inflation, on the other hand, while being small on the\none-percent level, is highly significant. We show that after the end of\ninflation there will be a period of isotropization lasting for about 2N/3\ne-folds. After that the shear scales as the curvature and becomes dominant\naround N e-folds after the end of inflation. For plausible bounds on the reheat\ntemperature the minimum number of e-folds during inflation, required for\nconsistency with the isotropy of the supernova Ia data, lays in the interval\n(21,48). Thus the results obtained for our restricted class of spacetimes\nindicates that inflation with anisotropic hair is cosmologically viable. \n\n"}

The parameter c_{w} is a correction term for\nthe GCLF width sigma.

For a jet with an ultrarelativistic equation of state\nand external pressure that decreases as a power of spherical radius, p \\propto\nr^(-eta), the jet interior will lose causal contact when eta > 2. However, the\nouter layers of the jet gradually collimate toward the jet axis as long as eta\n< 4, leading to the formation of a shocked boundary layer. Assuming that\npressure-matching across the shock front determines the shape of the shock, we\nstudy the resulting structure of the jet in two ways: first by assuming that\nthe pressure remains constant across the shocked boundary layer and looking for\nsolutions to the shock jump equations, and then by constructing self-similar\nboundary-layer solutions that allow for a pressure gradient across the shocked\nlayer.

We\nperform the first fully self-consistent Braginskii-MHD simulations of galaxy\nclusters including both of these effects. Specifically, we perform local and\nglobal simulations of the magnetothermal instability (MTI) and the\nheat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) and assess the effects of viscosity\non their saturation and astrophysical implications. We find that viscosity has\nonly a modest effect on the saturation of the MTI. As in previous calculations,\nwe find that the MTI can generate nearly sonic turbulent velocities in the\nouter parts of galaxy clusters, although viscosity somewhat suppresses the\nmagnetic field amplification. At smaller radii in cool-core clusters, viscosity\ncan decrease the linear growth rates of the HBI. However, it has less of an\neffect on the HBI's nonlinear saturation, in part because three-dimensional\ninterchange motions (magnetic flux tubes slipping past each other) are not\ndamped by anisotropic viscosity. In global simulations of cool core clusters,\nwe show that the HBI robustly inhibits radial thermal conduction and thus\nprecipitates a cooling catastrophe. The effects of viscosity are, however, more\nimportant for higher entropy clusters. We argue that viscosity can contribute\nto the global transition of cluster cores from cool-core to non cool-core\nstates: additional sources of intracluster turbulence, such as can be produced\nby AGN feedback or galactic wakes, suppress the HBI, heating the cluster core\nby thermal conduction; this makes the ICM more viscous, which slows the growth\nof the HBI, allowing further conductive heating of the cluster core and a\ntransition to a non cool-core state. \n\n"}

The main results of the present work are the\nfollowing: (1) DM fractions increase systematically with both structural\nparameters and mass proxies, as in previous studies, and decrease with central\nstellar density. 2) All correlations involving DM fractions are caused by two\nfundamental ones with galaxy effective radius and central velocity dispersion.\nThese correlations are independent of each other, so that ETGs populate a\ncentral-DM plane (DMP), i.e. a correlation among fraction of total-to-stellar\nmass, effective radius, and velocity dispersion, whose scatter along the\ntotal-to-stellar mass axis amounts to \\sim 0.15 dex.

The\nanswers that emerged from the workshop are (1) better measurements of H_0\nprovide critical independent constraints on dark energy, spatial curvature of\nthe Universe, neutrino physics, and validity of general relativity, (2) a\nmeasurement of H_0 to 1% in both precision and accuracy, supported by rigorous\nerror budgets, is within reach for several methods, and (3) multiple paths to\nindependent determinations of H_0 are needed in order to access and control\nsystematics. \n\n"}

Such Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback can account for the\nobserved proportionality between central black hole and host galaxy mass.\nDirect observational evidence for the radiative or quasar mode of feedback,\nwhich occurs when the AGN is very luminous, has been difficult to obtain but is\naccumulating from a few exceptional objects. Feedback from the kinetic or radio\nmode, which uses the mechanical energy of radio-emitting jets often seen when\nthe AGN is operating at a lower level, is common in massive elliptical\ngalaxies.

The magnification of the soft band appears to be larger than that\nin the hard band by a factor of ~ 1.3 when image D becomes more magnified.

We obtain a \"phase diagram\" of the system as a function of binary\nparameters, showing regimes in which both the disk structure and migration have\na different character. Although massive binaries can create a central gap in\nthe disk at large radii, the tidal barrier of the secondary causes a\nsignificant pile-up of gas outside of its orbit, which can lead to the closing\nof the gap. We find that this spillover occurs at an orbital separation as\nlarge as ~200 M_7^{-1/2} gravitational radii, where M = 10^7 M_7 Msun is the\ntotal binary mass. If the secondary is less massive than ~10^6 Msun, then the\ngap is closed before gravitational waves (GWs) start dominating the orbital\ndecay.

Our analysis is based on a spectral\ndecomposition technique which allows us to isolate the microlensed fraction of\nthe flux independently of a detailed modeling of the quasar emission lines.\nUsing this technique, we detect microlensing of the continuum in 85% of the\nsystems.

Yet, as stars evolve off the main\nsequence their vulnerability to tidal disruption increases drastically as they\ndevelop a bifurcated structure consisting of a dense core and a tenuous\nenvelope. Here we present the first hydrodynamic simulations of the tidal\ndisruption of giant stars and show that the core has a substantial influence on\nthe star's ability to survive the encounter. Stars with more massive cores\nretain large fractions of their envelope mass, even in deep encounters.\nAccretion flares resulting from the disruption of giant stars should last for\ntens to hundreds of years. Their characteristic signature in transient searches\nwould not be the $t^{-5/3}$ decay typically associated with tidal disruption\nevents, but a correlated rise over many orders of magnitude in brightness on\nmonths to years timescales. We calculate the relative disruption rates of stars\nof varying evolutionary stages in typical galactic centers, then use our\nresults to produce Monte Carlo realizations of the expected flaring event\npopulations.

Using galaxy group/cluster catalogs from SDSS DR7, together with a\ncosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star\nformation histories and quenching timescales of satellites of M_star > 5 x 10^9\nM_sun at z=0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing\nand ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly\naccounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z~0.5, or ~5 Gyr\nago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of satellites at their\ntime of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the\nevolution of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we\nconstrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of\nsatellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant\nprocess for building up all quiescent galaxies at M_star < 10^10 M_sun. We then\nconstrain satellite star formation histories, finding a 'delayed-then-rapid'\nquenching scenario: satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall,\nafter which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of < 0.8\nGyr. These quenching timescales are shorter for more massive satellites but do\nnot depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in satellite quiescent\nfraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a\nlower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible\nfor up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. Because of the long\ntime delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellar\nmass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact\nprovides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method. \n\n"}

We quantify\nleading-order general relativistic corrections to this spread in energy and\nfind that they are small. We also examine the role of stellar spin, and find\nthat a combination of spin-orbit misalignment, rapid rotation, and high beta\nmay increase the spread in debris energy.

At the lowest\nfrequencies available in the lightcurve (<1.5E-4 Hz), we find hard lags where\nthe power-law dominated hard band lags the soft band (where the reflection\nfraction is high). However, at higher frequencies in the range (2-3)E-4 Hz we\nfind a soft lag of -325 +/- 89 s. The general evolution from hard to soft lags\nas the frequency increases is similar to other AGN where soft lags have been\ndetected.

They are\nthought to correspond to early formative stages of disk galaxies. On the other\nhand, halo objects, such as old globular clusters and halo stars, are likely to\nconsist of the oldest stars in a galaxy (age>10 Gyr), therefore the clumpy disk\nformation can be presumed to take place in a pre-existing halo system. Aims:\nGiant clumps are orbiting in the same direction in a premature disk and so\nmassive that they may be expected to interact gravitationally with halo objects\nand exercise influence on kinematic state of the halo. Accordingly, I\nscrutinize the possibility that the clumps leave a kinematic imprint of the\nclumpy disk formation on a halo system. Methods: I perform a restricted N-body\ncalculation with a toy-model to study the kinematic influence on a halo by\norbital motions of clumps, examine dependence of the results on masses\n(mass-loss), number and orbital radii of the clumps. Results: I will show that\nhalo objects can catch clump motions and acquire disky rotation in a dynamical\nfriction time-scale of the clumps, ~0.5 Gyr. The influence of clumps is limited\nwithin a region around the disk, the halo system shows vertical gradients of\nnet rotation velocity and orbital eccentricity. The significance of the\nkinematic influence strongly depends on the clump masses, the lower limit of\npostulated clump mass would be 5x10^8 solar masses. The result depends also on\nwhether the clumps are subjected to rapid mass-loss or not, which is an open\nquestion under debate in recent studies. The existence of such massive clumps\nis not unrealistic, I therefore suggest that there could remain the imprints of\npast clumpy disk formation in current galactic halos. \n\n"}

Following recent theoretical models of wind mass loss and core\ncollapse supernovae, we assume that the mass of the stellar remnants depends on\nthe metallicity of the progenitor stars. In particular, massive metal-poor\nstars (Z<=0.3 Zsun) are enabled to form massive stellar black holes (MSBHs,\nwith mass >=25 Msun) through direct collapse.

Despite using a universal local law to form stars in the\nsimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spirals\non the large-scale Kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times less\nefficiently. This offset is in agreement with previous results on morphological\nquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded in\nearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. As\na result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach as\nhigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. Even if some molecular gas is\npresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantly\nreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency.

This explains why all classical (non-quantum) WDM N-body\nsimulations fail to explain galactic cores and their sizes. We describe\nfermionic WDM galaxies in an analytic semiclassical framework based on the\nThomas-Fermi approach, we resolve it numerically and find the main physical\ngalaxy magnitudes: mass, halo radius, phase-space density, velocity dispersion,\nfully consistent with observations, including compact dwarf galaxies.

We show that compact dwarf galaxies are natural quantum\nmacroscopic objects supported against gravity by the fermionic WDM quantum\npressure (quantum degenerate fermions) with a minimal galaxy mass and minimal\nvelocity dispersion.

In this paper, we investigate the validity domain of this\nassumption. Indeed, that premise disregards microlensing of the accretion disc\nin the MIR range, and does not account for recent progress in our knowledge of\nthe dusty torus. To simulate microlensing, we first built a simplified image of\nthe quasar composed of an accretion disc, and of a larger ring-like torus. The\nmock quasars are then microlensed using an inverse ray-shooting code. We\nsimulated the wavelength and size dependence of microlensing for different\nlensed image types and fraction of compact objects projected in the lens. This\nallows us to derive magnification probabilities as a function of wavelength, as\nwell as to calculate the microlensing-induced deformation of the spectral\nenergy distribution of the lensed images. We find that microlensing variations\nas large as 0.1 mag are very common at 11 microns (observer-frame). The main\nsignal comes from microlensing of the accretion disc, which may be significant\neven when the fraction of flux from the disc is as small as 5 % of the total\nflux. We also show that the torus of sources with Lbol <~ 10^45 erg/s is\nexpected to be noticeably microlensed. Microlensing may thus be used to get\ninsight into the rest near-infrared inner structure of AGNs. Finally, we\ninvestigate whether microlensing in the mid-infrared can alter the so-called\nRcusp relation that links the fluxes of the lensed images triplet produced when\nthe source lies close to a cusp macro-caustic. This relation is commonly used\nto identify massive (dark-matter) substructures in lensing galaxies.

To account for the principle effects of general\nrelativity (GR), we propose a modification of the standard Newtonian evolution\nequation for the (orbit-averaged) time-varying disk surface density. In our\nmodified equation the viscous torque in the disk is treated in full GR, while\nthe tidal torque is handled in the Newtonian limit. Our GR-hybrid treatment is\nreasonable because the tidal torque is concentrated near the orbital radius of\nthe secondary and is most important prior to binary-disk decoupling, when the\norbital separation is large and resides in the weak-field regime. The tidal\ntorque on the disk diminishes during late merger and vanishes altogether\nfollowing merger. By contrast, the viscous torque drives the flow into the\nstrong-field region and onto the primary during all epochs.

Using the popular CPL parametrization of the dark energy, w = w0\n+wa(1-a), we generate mock SN Ia samples that can be projected out to higher\nredshifts. The synthetic datasets thus generated are fitted to the CPL model,\nand we evaluate the improvement that a high-z sample can add in terms of\nameliorating the statistical and systematic uncertainties on cosmological\nparameters.\n  Results. In an optimistic but still very achievable scenario, we find that\nextending the HST sample beyond CANDELS+CLASH to reach a total of 28 SN Ia at z\n> 1.0 could improve the uncertainty in the wa parameter by up to 21%. The\ncorresponding improvement in the figure of merit (FoM) would be as high as 28%.\nFinally, we consider the use of high-redshift SN Ia samples to detect\nnon-cosmological evolution in SN Ia luminosities with redshift, finding that\nsuch tests could be undertaken by future spacebased infrared surveys using the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST). \n\n"}

The moving cluster effect can be expressed as\nthe scalar product of the lensing deflection angle with the tangential velocity\nof the mass components, and it is maximal for clusters colliding in the plane\nof the sky with velocities boosted by their mutual gravity. The bullet cluster\nis likely to be the best candidate for the first measurement of this effect due\nto the large collision velocity and because the lensing deflection and the\ncluster fields can be calculated in advance. We derive the deflection field\nusing multiply-lensed background galaxies detected with the Hubble Space\nTelescope. The velocity field is modeled using self-consistent\nN-body/hydrodynamical simulations constrained by the observed X-ray and\ngravitational lensing features of this system.

We select quiescent galaxies on the basis of the widely used\nUVJ color-color criteria. Spectral energy distribution fitting (rest frame\noptical and near-IR) indicates very low star formation rates for quiescent\ngalaxies (sSFR ~ 10^-12 yr^-1). However, SED fitting can miss star formation if\nit is hidden behind high dust obscuration and ionizing radiation is re-emitted\nin the mid-infrared. It is therefore fundamental to measure the dust-obscured\nSFRs with a mid-IR indicator. We stack the MIPS-24um images of quiescent\nobjects in five redshift bins centered on z = 0.5, 0.9, 1.2, 1.7, 2.2 and\nperform aperture photometry.

If dark matter exists as WDM instead of cold dark matter (CDM), its\nnon-negligible velocities can inhibit the formation of low-mass halos that\nnormally form first in CDM models, therefore delaying star-formation. The\nabsence of early sources delays the build-up of UV and X-ray backgrounds that\naffect the 21-cm radiation signal produced by neutral hydrogen. With use of the\n21CMFAST, code, we demonstrate that the pre-reionization 21-cm signal can be\nchanged significantly in WDM models with a free-streaming length equivalent to\nthat of a thermal relic with mass mx of up to ~10-20 keV. In such a WDM\ncosmology, the 21-cm signal traces the growth of more massive halos, resulting\nin a delay of the 21-cm absorption signature and followed by accelerated X-ray\nheating. CDM models where astrophysical sources have a suppressed\nphoton-production efficiency can delay the 21-cm signal as well, although its\nsubsequent evolution is not as rapid as compared to WDM. This motivates using\nthe gradient of the global 21-cm signal to differentiate between some CDM and\nWDM models. Finally, we show that the degeneracy between the astrophysics and\nmx can be broken with the 21-cm power spectrum, as WDM models should have a\nbias-induced excess of power on large scales. This boost in power should be\ndetectable with current interferometers for models with mx < 3 keV, while next\ngeneration instruments will easily be able to measure this difference for all\nrelevant WDM models. \n\n"}

The remnant mass fraction in the total\n(living+remnant) stellar mass of a simple stellar population monotonically\nincreases with the age of the population, and the initial mass function and\nmetallicity affect the increasing rate. Since galaxies are composed of a number\nof stellar populations, the remnant mass fraction may depend on the total\nstellar mass of galaxies in a complex way. As a result, the shape of the\nstellar mass function of galaxies may change, depending on the definition of\nthe stellar mass. In order to explore this issue, we ran a cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulation, and then, we have found that the remnant mass\nfraction indeed correlates with the total stellar mass of galaxies. However,\nthis correlation is weak and the remnant fraction can be regarded as a constant\nwhich depends only on the redshift. Therefore, the shape of the stellar mass\nfunction is almost unchanged, but it simply shifts horizontally if the remnant\nmass includes or not. The shift is larger at lower redshift and it reaches\n0.2-dex at z=0 for a Chabrier IMF. Since this causes a systematic difference,\nwe should take care of the definition of the `stellar' mass, when comparing\none's result with others. \n\n"}

Using a modified black-body fit to\nthe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, and\nspectral index over the 353-3000 GHz range.

The\nPlanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the whole\nsky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared to\nprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. An\nincrease of the dust opacity at 353 GHz, tau_353/N_H, from the diffuse to the\ndenser interstellar medium (ISM) is reported. It is associated with a decrease\nin the observed dust temperature, T_obs, that could be due at least in part to\nthe increased dust opacity.

This young starburst is representative of\nUV-selected star-forming galaxies (SFG) at z~2 and contains multiple individual\nstar-forming regions. Due to the lensing magnification, we can resolve spatial\nscales down to 100pc in the source plane of the galaxy. The velocity field\nshows disturbed kinematics suggestive of an ongoing interaction, and there is a\nclear signature of a tidal tail. We constrain the age, reddening, SFR and\nstellar mass of the star-forming clumps from SED modelling of the WFC3\nphotometry and measure their H-alpha luminosity, metallicity and outflow\nproperties from the OSIRIS data. With strong star formation driven outflows in\nfour clumps, RCSGA0327 is the first high redshift SFG at stellar mass <10^10\nM_sun with spatially resolved stellar winds.

[...] One of the most efficient methods is the measurement of the\nequivalent width (EW) of the Calcium II Triplet (CaT), corrected for the\nluminosity and temperature effects via magnitude differences from the\nhorizontal branch (HB). Methods. We use the Ks magnitude difference between the\nstar and the reddest part of the HB (RHB) to generate reduced equivalent widths\n(rEW) from the datasets presented in Saviane et al. (2012) and Rutledge et al.\n(1997). Subsequently we calibrated these rEW against three different\nmetellicity (met) scales: the one presented in Carretta et al. (2009), the met\nvalues given in Harris (2010) and a version of the former corrected via\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic met. Results. We calculated the calibration\nrelations for the two datasets and the three met scales and found that they are\napproximately equivalent, with differences almost negligible. We compared our\nnIR calibrations with the corresponding optical ones, and found them to be\nequivalent, establishing that the luminosity-corrected rEW using the Ks\nmagnitude is compatible with the one obtained from the V magnitude.

We have established that the\n([Fe/H]:rEW) relation is independent from the mag used for the luminosity\ncorrection and find that the calibration relations only change slightly for\ndifferent met scales.

Here, we investigate the role that\nspatial resolution plays in this apparent conflict. We use a recent catalogue\nof young ($<10$~Myr) massive ($>5000$~\\msun) clusters in the nearby spiral\ngalaxy, M83, along with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging in the optical and\nnear-IR, and ground based near-IR imaging, to see how the colours (and hence\nestimated properties such as age and extinction) are affected by the aperture\nsize employed, in order to simulate studies of differing resolution. We find\nthat the near-IR is heavily affected by the resolution, and when aperture sizes\n$>40$~pc are used, all young/blue clusters move red-ward in colour space, which\nresults in their appearance as heavily extincted clusters. However, this is due\nto contamination from nearby sources and nebular emission, and is not an\nextinction effect. Optical colours are much less affected by resolution.

SPIRE point-source catalogs and\n  number counts Abstract: We present three independent catalogs of point-sources extracted from SPIRE\nimages at 250, 350, and 500 micron as a part of the Herschel Virgo Cluster\nSurvey (HeViCS). The source positions are determined by estimating the\nlikelihood to be a real source for each peak on the maps and the flux densities\nare estimated using the sourceExtractorTimeline, a timeline-based point source\nfitter. Afterwards, each source is subtracted from the maps, removing a\nGaussian function in every position with the full width half maximum equal to\nthat estimated in sourceExtractorTimeline. This procedure improves the\nrobustness of our algorithm in terms of source identification. The HeViCS\ncatalogs contain about 52000, 42200, and 18700 sources selected at 250, 350,\nand 500 micron above 3sigma and are ~ 75%, 62%, and 50% complete at flux\ndensities of 20 mJy at 250, 350, 500 micron, respectively. We then measured\nsource number counts at 250, 350, and 500 micron and we also cross-correlated\nthe catalogs with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to investigate the redshift\ndistribution of the nearby sources. From this cross-correlation, we select\n~2000 sources with reliable fluxes and a high signal-to-noise ratio, finding an\naverage redshift z~0.3+/-0.22. The number counts at 250, 350, and 500 micron\nshow an increase in the slope below 200 mJy, indicating a strong evolution in\nnumber of density for galaxies at these fluxes.

Abstract: We present follow-up observations of an optical transient (OT) discovered by\nROTSE on Jan. 21, 2009. Photometric monitoring was carried out with ROTSE-IIIb\nin the optical and Swift in the UV up to +70 days after discovery. The light\ncurve showed a fast rise time of ~10 days followed by a steep decline over the\nnext 60 days, which was much faster than that implied by 56Ni - 56Co\nradioactive decay. The SDSS DR10 database contains a faint, red object at the\nposition of the OT, which appears slightly extended. This and other lines of\nevidence suggest that the OT is of extragalactic origin, and this faint object\nis likely the host galaxy. A sequence of optical spectra obtained with the\n9.2-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) between +8 and +45 days after discovery\nrevealed a hot, blue continuum with no visible spectral features. A few weak\nfeatures that appeared after +30 days probably originated from the underlying\nhost.

At this redshift the peak magnitude of the OT\nis close to -22.5, similar to the brightest super-luminous supernovae; however,\nthe lack of identifiable spectral features makes the massive stellar death\nhypothesis less likely. A more plausible explanation appears to be the tidal\ndisruption of a sun-like star by the central super-massive black hole.

We have\ninvestigated orbital evolution in a formation scenario for such planets, based\non core accretion model: i) Icy cores accrete from planetesimals at $\\lesssim$\n30AU, ii) they are scattered outward by an emerging nearby gas giant to acquire\nhighly eccentric orbits, and iii) their orbits are circularized through\naccretion of disk gas in outer regions, where they spend most of time. We\nanalytically derived equations to describe the orbital circularization through\nthe gas accretion. Numerical integrations of these equations show that the\neccentricity decreases by a factor of more than 5 during the planetary mass\nincreases by a factor of 10. Because runaway gas accretion increases planetary\nmass by $\\sim$ 10--300, the orbits are sufficiently circularized.

We explored two cases: cluster dispersal\nthrough planetary gravity alone over 1 Gyr, and a 1 Gyr evolution due to both\ngravity and the Yarkovsky effect. We find that the dispersal of the cluster in\neccentricity is primarily due to dynamical chaos, while the inclinations and\nlibration amplitudes are primarily changed by the Yarkovsky effect. Current\ndistribution of the cluster members orbits are indicative of an initially tight\norbital grouping that was affected by a negative acceleration (i.e. one against\nthe orbital motion) consistent with the thermal Yarkovsky effect. We conclude\nthat the cluster is a genetic family formed either in a collision or through\nmultiple rotational fissions.

Shocks\nnear the stellar pericenter and also near the apocenter of the most\ntightly-bound debris dissipate orbital energy, but only enough to make the\ncharacteristic radius comparable to the semi-major axis of the most-bound\nmaterial, not the tidal radius as previously thought. The outer shocks are\ncaused by post-Newtonian effects, both on the stellar orbit during its\ndisruption and on the tidal forces.

Our\nsimulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the\nefficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization\nif radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams\nself-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the\nintersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a\ngeometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring\nrapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a\ngeometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is\nefficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and\nforms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated\nenergy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the\nsubsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to\n~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find\nthat a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced\ncircularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning\nblack hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably\nlong in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black\nhole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important\nnodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the\nother hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in\nthe radiatively inefficient case. We also discuss the relationship between our\nsimulations and the parabolic TDEs that are characteristic of most stellar\ntidal disruptions. \n\n"}

Both analytical work and simulations have shown that typical\nencounters generate streams that are extremely thin. In this paper we show that\nthis implies that even small relativistic precessions attributed to black hole\nspin can induce deflections that prevent the stream from self-intersecting even\nafter many windings. Additionally, hydrodynamical simulations have demonstrated\nthat energy is deposited very slowly via hydrodynamic processes alone,\nresulting in the liberation of very little gravitational binding energy in the\nabsence of stream-stream collisions. This naturally leads to a \"dark period\" in\nwhich the flare is not observable for some time, persisting for up to a dozen\norbital periods of the most bound material, which translates to years for\ndisruptions around black holes with mass $\\sim 10^{7} M_{\\odot}$. We find that\nmore-massive black holes tend to have more violent stream self-intersections,\nresulting in short viscous times that lead to prompt accretion onto the black\nhole. For these tidal disruption events (TDEs), the accretion rate onto the\nblack hole should still closely follow the original fallback rate after a fixed\ndelay time $t_{\\rm delay}$. For lower black hole masses ($M_{\\rm h} \\lesssim\n10^{6}$), we find that flares are typically slowed down by about an order of\nmagnitude, and because the accretion rates for TDEs about higher-mass black\nhole are already sub-Eddington, this results in the majority of TDEs being\nsub-Eddington at peak. This also implies that current searches for TDEs are\nbiased towards prompt flares, with slowed flares likely having been\nunidentified. [abridged] \n\n"}

This results in a heating mechanism that\nis only weakly sensitive to the local density, and therefore approximately\nspatially uniform, naturally producing an inverted temperature-density relation\nin underdense regions. In this paper we go beyond the approximation of uniform\nheating and quantify the heating rate fluctuations due to the clustered\ndistribution of blazars and how this impacts on the thermal history of the IGM.\nWe analytically compute a filtering function that relates the heating rate\nfluctuations to the underlying dark matter density field.

This is mainly for two reasons. One relies on the gravitational\npotential of a moving lens being time-dependent (the $\\text{Moving}$\n$\\text{Cluster}$ $\\text{Effect}$, $\\text{MCE}$). The other is due to uneven\nmagnification across the extended, rotating source (the $\\text{Differential}$\n$\\text{Magnification}$ $\\text{Effect}$, $\\text{DME}$). The time delay between\nthe images can also cause their redshifts to differ because of cosmological\nexpansion. This Differential Expansion Effect is likely to be small. Using a\nsimple model, we derive these effects from first principles.\n  One application would be to the Bullet Cluster, whose large tangential\nvelocity may be inconsistent with the $\\Lambda CDM$ paradigm. This velocity can\nbe estimated with complicated hydrodynamic models. Uncertainties with such\nmodels can be avoided using the MCE. We argue that the MCE should be observable\nwith ALMA.\n  However, such measurements can be corrupted by the DME if typical spiral\ngalaxies are used as sources. Fortunately, we find that if detailed spectral\nline profiles were available, then the DME and MCE could be distinguished. It\nmight also be feasible to calculate how much the DME should affect the mean\nredshift of each image. Resolved observations of the source would be required\nto do this accurately.\n  The DME is of order the source angular size divided by the Einstein radius\ntimes the redshift variation across the source. Thus, it mostly affects nearly\nedge-on spiral galaxies in certain orientations. This suggests that observers\nshould reduce the DME by careful choice of target, a possibility we discuss in\nsome detail. \n\n"}

Traditionally, the emission lines employed\nare in the visible wavelength range, and the number of suitable lines is\nlimited. Furthermore, when using these lines, large systematic uncertainties in\nhelium abundance determinations arise due to the degeneracy of physical\nparameters, such as temperature and density. Recently, Izotov, Thuan, & Guseva\n(2014) have pioneered adding the He 10830 infrared emission line in helium\nabundance determinations. The strong electron density dependence of He 10830\nmakes it ideal for better constraining density, potentially breaking the\ndegeneracy with temperature.

The solutions are better constrained, in particular for\nelectron density, temperature, and the neutral hydrogen fraction, improving the\nmodel fit to data, with the result that more spectra now pass screening for\nquality and reliability, in addition to a standard 95% confidence level cut.\nFurthermore, the addition of He 10830 decreases the uncertainty on the helium\nabundance for all galaxies, with reductions in the uncertainty ranging from\n10-80%.

The dramatic improvement in the\nuncertainty from incorporating He 10830 strongly supports the case for\nsimultaneous (thus not requiring scaling) observations of visible and infrared\nhelium emission line spectra. \n\n"}

Quasi-single-field (QsF) inflation is a relatively simple family of\nphenomenological models that serve as a proxy for theories with additional\nfields with masses $m\\sim H$. Since QsF inflation involves fields in addition\nto the inflaton, the consistency conditions (ccs) between correlations that\narise in single-clock inflation are not necessarily satisfied. As a result,\ncorrelation functions in the squeezed limit may be larger than in single-field\ninflation. Scalar non-Gaussianities mediated by the massive isocurvature field\nin QsF have been shown to be potentially observable. These are especially\ninteresting since they would convey information about the mass of the\nisocurvature field. Here we consider non-Gaussian correlators involving tensor\nmodes and their observational signatures. A physical correlation between a\n(long-wavelength) tensor mode and two scalar modes (tss), for instance, may\ngive rise to local departures from statistical isotropy or, in other words, a\nnon-trivial four-point function.

We compare our sample with 80 non-interacting galaxies. We\nmeasure for the stellar and the ionized gas components the major (projected)\nkinematic position angles (PA$_{\\mathrm{kin}}$, approaching and receding)\ndirectly from the velocity fields with no assumptions on the internal motions.\nThis method allow us to derive the deviations of the kinematic PAs from a\nstraight line ($\\delta$PA$_{\\mathrm{kin}}$). Around half of the interacting\nobjects show morpho-kinematic PA misalignments that cannot be found in the\ncontrol sample. Those misalignments are present mostly in galaxies with\nmorphological signatures of interaction. Alignment between the kinematic sides\nfor both samples is similar, with most of the galaxies displaying small\nmisalignments. Radial deviations of the kinematic PA from a straight line in\nthe stellar component measured by $\\delta$PA$_{\\mathrm{kin}}$ are large for\nboth samples.

The improved hard X-ray\nsensitivity of the imaging NuSTAR data has resulted in the first robust\ndetection of Compton hump in all three objects, with amplitudes of ~1 or\ngreater in NY Lup, and likely <1.0 in the other two.

Photometric\nredshifts are more easily available for large numbers of galaxies, but at the\nprice of larger uncertainties than spectroscopic ones. In this work we study\nhow photometric redshifts affect the measurement of galaxy environment and how\nthis may limit an analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) in\ndifferent environments. Using mock galaxy catalogues, we measured the\nenvironment with a fixed aperture method, using each galaxy's true and\nphotometric redshifts. We varied the fixed aperture volume parameters and the\nphotometric redshift uncertainties. We then computed GSMF as a function of\nredshift and environment. We found that only when using high-precision\nphotometric redshifts with $\\sigma_{\\Delta z/(1+z)} \\le 0.01$, the most extreme\nenvironments can be reconstructed in a fairly accurate way, with a fraction\n$\\ge 60\\div 80\\%$ of galaxies placed in the correct density quartile and a\ncontamination of $\\le 10\\%$ by opposite quartile interlopers.

While previous\nstudies emphasized the impact of feedback on dark matter profiles, we\ninvestigate the impact on the stellar component: kinematics, radial migration,\nsize evolution, and population gradients. Feedback-driven outflows/inflows\ndrive significant radial stellar migration over both short and long timescales\nvia two processes: (1) outflowing/infalling gas can remain star-forming,\nproducing young stars that migrate $\\sim1{\\rm\\,kpc}$ within their first $100\n{\\rm\\,Myr}$, and (2) gas outflows/inflows drive strong fluctuations in the\nglobal potential, transferring energy to all stars. These processes produce\nseveral dramatic effects. First, galaxies' effective radii can fluctuate by\nfactors of $>2$ over $\\sim200 {\\rm\\,Myr}$, and these rapid size fluctuations\ncan account for much of the observed scatter in radius at fixed $M_{\\rm star}.$\nSecond, the cumulative effects of many outflow/infall episodes steadily heat\nstellar orbits, causing old stars to migrate outward most strongly.

Similarly, a direct\ncross-correlation of the CFHTLenS data with Planck CMB lensing data yielded an\nanomalously low amplitude compared to expectations based on Planck or\nWMAP-derived cosmological parameters (Liu & Hill 2015). One potential\nexplanation for these results is a multiplicative bias afflicting the CFHTLenS\ngalaxy shape measurements, from which shears are inferred. Simulations are used\nin the CFHTLenS pipeline to calibrate such biases, but no data-driven\nconstraints have been presented to date. In this paper, we cross-correlate\nCFHTLenS galaxy density maps with CFHTLenS shear maps and Planck CMB lensing\nmaps to calibrate an additional multiplicative shear bias (m) in CFHTLenS\n(beyond the multiplicative correction that has already been applied to the\nCFHTLenS galaxy shears), following methods suggested by Vallinotto (2012) and\nDas et al.

This matches the expectation that the shapes of\nfaint galaxies are the most prone to measurement biases. Our results for m are\nessentially independent of the assumed cosmology, and only weakly sensitive to\nassumptions about the galaxy bias. We consider three galaxy bias models,\nfinding in all cases that the best-fit multiplicative shear bias is less than\nunity. A value of m~0.9 would suffice to reconcile the amplitude of density\nfluctuations inferred from the CFHTLenS shear two-point statistics with that\ninferred from Planck CMB temperature data.

For\nMbh<10^7Msun, the typical TDE is due to a M*~0.3Msun M-dwarf, although the mass\nfunction is relatively flat for $M*<Msun. The contribution from older main\nsequence stars and sub-giants is small but not negligible. From\nMbh~10^7.5-10^8.5Msun, the balance rapidly shifts to higher mass stars and a\nlarger contribution from evolved stars, and is ultimately dominated by evolved\nstars at higher BH masses. The star formation history has little effect until\nthe rates are dominated by evolved stars. TDE rates should decline very rapidly\ntowards higher redshifts. The volumetric rate of TDEs is very high because the\nBH mass function diverges for low masses. However, any emission mechanism which\nis largely Eddington-limited for low BH masses suppresses this divergence in\nany observed sample and leads to TDE samples dominated by Mbh~10^6.0-10^7.5Msun\nBHs with roughly Eddington peak accretion rates. The typical fall back time is\nrelatively long, with 16% having Tfb<10^(-1) years (37 days), and 84% having\nlonger time scales. Many residual rate discrepancies can be explained if\nsurveys are biased against TDEs with these longer Tfb, which seems very\nplausible if Tfb has any relation to the transient rise time. For almost any BH\nmass function, systematic searches for fainter, faster time scale TDEs in\nsmaller galaxies, and longer time scale TDEs in more massive galaxies are\nlikely to be rewarded. \n\n"}

Our spectroscopy has yielded only one\npossible detection of Lya at z=7.168 with a rest-frame equivalent width EW_0 =\n3.7 (+1.7/-1.1) Angstrom. The relative weakness of this line, combined with our\nfailure to detect Lya emission from the other spectroscopic targets allows us\nto place a new upper limit on the prevalence of strong Lya emission at these\nredshifts.

Using the spectroscopic data\nwe computed time-resolved Doppler tomograms of the system demonstrating its\nbehavior at different orbital phases. In the tomograms one can see the periodic\nbrightening of different regions within one orbital cycle. We interpret this\nbrightening as being due to the interaction of four phase-locked shock waves in\nthe disk with a specific internal precessing density wave that develops inside\nthe disk, because of the tidal influence of the secondary star, and this\ndensity wave propagates up to the disk's outer regions. When the outer part of\nthe density wave in its precessional motion reaches a shock wave the local\ndensity grows, which amplifies the shock (by increasing $\\rho V^{2}/2$). This\nresults in an additional energy release in the shock and can be observed as a\nbrightening.

To do so, we\nquantify the azimuthal dependence of the stacked lensing signal around seven\ndifferent proxies for the orientation of the dark matter distribution, as it is\na priori unknown which one traces the orientation best. On small scales, the\nmajor axis of the brightest group/cluster member (BCG) provides the best proxy,\nleading to a clear detection of an anisotropic signal. In order to relate that\nto a halo ellipticity, we have to adopt a model density profile. We derive new\nexpressions for the quadrupole moments of the shear field given an elliptical\nmodel surface mass density profile. Modeling the signal with an elliptical\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile on scales < 250 kpc, which roughly\ncorresponds to half the virial radius, and assuming that the BCG is perfectly\naligned with the dark matter, we find an average halo ellipticity of e_h=0.38\n+/- 0.12.

Adopting event rates from the literature, we aim\nto establish general trends in the redshift evolution of the TDE number counts\nand their observable signals.

Here we analyse the stability of a large sample of nearby\nstar-forming spirals treating molecular gas, atomic gas and stars as three\ndistinct components, and using radial profiles of sigma_CO and sigma_HI derived\nfrom HERACLES and THINGS observations. We show that the radial variations of\nsigma_CO and sigma_HI have a weak effect on the local stability level of galaxy\ndiscs, which remains remarkably flat and well above unity, but is low enough to\nensure (marginal) instability against non-axisymmetric perturbations and gas\ndissipation.

The latter is a scalar version of\nthe recently introduced Nonlinear Field Space Theory (NFST), where physical\nphase space of a given field is assumed to be compactified at large energies.\nFor our analysis we choose the simple case of a field with the spherical phase\nspace and endow it with the generalized Hamiltonian analogous to the XXZ\nHeisenberg model, normally describing a system of spins in condensed matter\nphysics. Subsequently, we study both the homogenous cosmological sector and\nlinear perturbations of such a test field. In the homogenous sector we find\nthat nonlinearity of the field phase space is becoming relevant for large\nvolumes of universe and then it can lead to a recollapse, and possibly also at\nvery high energies, leading to the phase of a bounce.

This prediction of the\nLambda-Cold Dark Matter cosmology is essential to modelling the galaxy\ndistribution to high precision and interpreting clustering measurements. As the\nname suggests, different manifestations of secondary halo bias have been\nthought to originate from halo assembly histories. We show conclusively that\nthis is incorrect for cluster-size haloes. We present an up-to-date summary of\nsecondary halo biases of high-mass haloes due to various halo properties\nincluding concentration, spin, several proxies of assembly history, and subhalo\nproperties. While concentration, spin, and the abundance and radial\ndistribution of subhaloes exhibit significant secondary biases, properties that\ndirectly quantify halo assembly history do not. In fact, the entire assembly\nhistories of haloes in pairs are nearly identical to those of isolated haloes.\nIn general, a global correlation between two halo properties does not predict\nwhether or not these two properties exhibit similar secondary biases. For\nexample, assembly history and concentration (or subhalo abundance) are\ncorrelated for both paired and isolated haloes, but follow slightly different\nconditional distributions in these two cases. This results in a secondary halo\nbias due to concentration (or subhalo abundance), despite the lack of assembly\nbias in the strict sense for cluster-size haloes. Due to this complexity,\ncaution must be exercised in using any one halo property as a proxy to study\nthe secondary bias due to another property. \n\n"}

The broadband\n$XMM$-$Newton+NuSTAR$ spectrum of P13 is qualitatively similar to the rest of\nthe ULX sample with broadband coverage, suggesting that additional ULXs in the\nknown population may host neutron star accretors.

In this\npaper, we propose a model of repeating FRBs which shows that they arise from\nthe several collisions between magnetized accretion disk of a black hole and an\naxion star orbiting the black hole. There would be many axions stars condensing\nas dark matter in an early stage galaxy so that such collisions arises\nrepeatedly. The radiations are emitted by coherent oscillations of electrons in\nthe accretion disk. The oscillations are caused by oscillating electric fields,\nwhich are induced by axion stars under strong magnetic field $\\sim\nO(10^{11})$G. The emissions are terminated by the thermal fluctuations of the\nelectrons which result from the thermalization of the oscillation energies.\nAlthough the radiations are monochromatic, the thermal Doppler effects broaden\nthe spectral lines; their spectra $S(\\nu)$ are given by $S(\\nu) \\propto\n\\exp(-(\\nu-\\nu_c)^2/2(\\delta\\nu)^2)$ with the center frequency $\\nu_c$. The\nbandwidth $\\delta\\nu=\\nu_c\\sqrt{T_c/m_e}$ with electron mass $m_e$ is\ndetermined by the critical temperature $T_c$ at which the thermal fluctuations\nterminate the coherent emissions.

Assumptions about how the foregrounds scale with\nfrequency are therefore crucial to interpreting the data. Recent results from\nthe Planck satellite collaboration claim significant evidence for a\ndecorrelation in the polarization signal of the spatial pattern of galactic\ndust between 353 GHz and 217 GHz. Such a decorrelation would suppress power in\nthe cross spectrum between high frequency maps, where the dust is strong, and\nlower frequency maps, where the sensitivity to cosmological $B$-modes is\nstrongest. Alternatively, it would leave residuals in lower frequency maps\ncleaned with a template derived from the higher frequency maps.

By analyzing a time series of stellar spectra from a host\nstar, modern astronomical instruments can in theory detect such planets.\nHowever, in practice, intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., star spots,\nconvective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial\nvelocity signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably\ndetect low-mass planets. A principled approach to recovering planet radial\nvelocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed by Rajpaul et\nal. (2015). It uses a multivariate Gaussian process model to jointly capture\ntime series of the apparent radial velocity and multiple indicators of stellar\nactivity.

In the Dirac\nmass scenario, gravitational leptogenesis predicts a relic abundance of sterile\nneutrinos that remain out of equilibrium, and the lepton asymmetry carried by\nthe standard model sector is unchanged.

This evolution is largely driven by tides\nacting on the innermost planets which then influence the outer ones. In order\nthat deviations from commensurability become significant only on $Gy$ time\nscales or longer, we require that the tidal parameter associated with the\nplanets has to be such that $Q' > \\sim 10^{2-3}.$ At the same time, if we start\nwith two subsystems, with the inner three planets comprising the inner one,\n$Q'$ associated with the planets has to be on the order (and not significantly\nexceeding) $10^{2-3}$ for the two subsystems to interact and end up in the\nobserved configuration.

For that reason, a numerical code which aims at describing the CR\ntransport in the Galaxy must unavoidably rely on accurate modelling of the\nproduction of secondary particles. In this work we provide a detailed\ndescription of the nuclear cross sections and decay network as implemented in\nthe forthcoming release of the galactic propagation code DRAGON2. We present\nthe secondary production models implemented in the code and we apply the\ndifferent prescriptions to compute quantities of interest to interpret local CR\nfluxes (e.g., nuclear fragmentation timescales, secondary and tertiary source\nterms). In particular, we develop a nuclear secondary production model aimed at\naccurately computing the light secondary fluxes (namely: Li, Be, B) above 1\nGeV/n.

Specifically, we show that the bias to halo\nmasses inferred from CMB lensing is eliminated by the utilization of clean\ngradients obtained from multi-frequency component separation involving Planck\nand WMAP data, and that special lensing maps for galaxy cross-correlations can\nbe prepared with only a small penalty in signal-to-noise while requiring no\nmasking, in-painting, modeling, or simulation effort for the tSZ bias. While we\nfocus on cross-correlations, we also show that gradient cleaning can mitigate\nbiases to the CMB lensing autospectrum that arise from the presence of\nforegrounds in temperature and polarization with minimal loss of\nsignal-to-noise. \n\n"}

In strongly interacting\ncompact star matter, at the crust-core transition, but also at the hadron-quark\ntransition in the core, these structures form different shapes dubbed \"pasta\nphases\". We describe two methods to obtain one-parameter families of hybrid\nequations of state (EoS) which mimic the thermodynamic behavior of pasta phases\nin between a low-density hadron and a high-density quark matter phase, thus\ngeneralizing the Maxwell construction. The first method replaces the behavior\nof pressure vs. chemical potential in a finite region around the critical\n%chemical potential pressure of the Maxwell construction by a polynomial\ninterpolation. The second method uses extrapolations of the hadronic and quark\nmatter EoS beyond the Maxwell point to define a mixing of both with weight\nfunctions bounded by finite limits around the Maxwell point. We apply both\nmethods to the case of a hybrid EoS with a strong first order transition that\nentails the formation of a third family of compact stars and the corresponding\nmass twin phenomenon. We investigate for both models the robustness of this\nphenomenon against variation of the single parameter, the pressure increment at\nthe critical chemical potential which quantifies the deviation from the Maxwell\nconstruction. We also show sets of results for other compact star observables\nthan mass and radius, namely the moment of inertia and the baryon mass. \n\n"}

This paper devotes to study the quantum bounce effects\nof primordial perturbations in the hybrid approach. The main discrepancy of\nthis approach is the effective positive mass at the quantum bounce for the\nevolution of the background that is dominated by the kinetic energy of the\ninflaton field at the bounce, while this mass is always nonpositive in the\ndressed metric approach. It is this positivity of the effective mass that\nviolates the adiabatic evolution of primordial perturbations at the initial\nmoments of the quantum bounce. With the assumption that the evolution of the\nbackground is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce, we\nfind that the effective potentials for both scalar and tensor perturbations can\nbe well approximately described by a P\\\"{o}schl-Teller (PT) potential, which\nallows us to find analytical solutions of perturbations, and from these\nanalytical expressions we are able to study the non-adiabatic evolution of\nprimordial perturbations in details.

We build on\nprevious efforts to model the c-M relation as a function of physical parameters\nsuch as the peak height, $\\nu$, and the effective power spectrum slope, $n_{\\rm\neff}$, which capture the dependence of $c$ on halo mass, redshift, and\ncosmology. We present three major improvements over previous models. First, we\nderive an analytical expression for the c-M relation that is valid under the\nassumption of pseudo-evolution, i.e., assuming that the density profiles of\nhalos are static in physical coordinates while the definition of their boundary\nevolves. We find that this ansatz is highly successful in describing the\nevolution of the low-mass end of the c-M relation.

With this in mind, we introduce the\n\"Purely-Geometric-BAO,\" which provides a rigorous tool to measure cosmological\ndistances without assuming a specific background cosmology. We focus on the\n2-point clustering correlation function monopole, and show how to implement\nsuch an inference scheme employing two different methodologies: the Linear\nPoint standard ruler (LP) and correlation-function model-fitting (CF-MF). For\nthe first time we demonstrate how, by means of the CF-MF, we can measure very\nprecisely the sound-horizon/isotropic-volume-distance ratio,\n$r_{d}/D_{V}(\\bar{z})$, while correctly propagating all the uncertainties.\nUsing synthetic data, we compare the outcomes of the two methodologies, and\nfind that the LP provides up to $50\\%$ more precise measurements than the\nCF-MF.

This leads to parallel tracks in plots of such parameters vs.\nLx. Where previous explanations require at least two time-variable independent\nparameters, e.g. Mdot through the disk and through a radial inflow, one is in\nfact sufficient if the systemic response to time variations in this variable\nhas both a prompt and a time-averaged component. I explore a scenario in which\nmost observable spectral and timing parameters to first order depend on disk\naccretion rate normalized by its own long-term average rather than on any\nindividual Mdot; Lx just depends on total Mdot. Thus, parameters can be\nuncorrelated to Mdot, yet vary in response to Mdot variations. Numerical\nsimulations of the model describing the dependence of kHz QPO frequency on Lx,\nwhich observationally is characterized by a striking pattern of parallel tracks\nboth in individual sources and between sources, reproduce the observations\nremarkably well.

Abstract: We model the 1990 giant X-ray flare of the quiescent galaxy NGC 5905 as the\ntidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. From the observed\nrapid decline of the luminosity, over a timescale of a few years, we argue that\nthe flare was powered by the fallback of debris rather than subsequent\naccretion via a thin disk. The fallback model allows constraints to be set on\nthe black hole mass and the mass of debris. The latter must be very much less\nthan a solar mass to explain the very low luminosity of the flare. The\nobservations can be explained either as the partial stripping of the outer\nlayers of a low-mass main sequence star or as the disruption of a brown dwarf\nor a giant planet. We find that the X-ray emission in the flare must have\noriginated within a small patch rather than over the entire torus of\ncircularized material surrounding the black hole. We suggest that the patch\ncorresponds to the ``bright spot'' where the stream of returning debris impacts\nthe torus.

Long believed to represent a\ncluster merger, recent X-ray and optical results have suggested that in\naddition to the primary cluster and subcluster there is evidence for a third,\npoorer system. We present wide-field, high sensitivity 1.4 GHz VLA radio\nobservations of Abell 2256 in conjunction with optical imaging and additional\nspectroscopy. Over 40 cluster radio galaxies are identified, with optical\nspectroscopy indicating the emission source (star formation or AGN) for most of\nthem. While the overall fraction of galaxies exhibiting radio emission is\nconsistent with a large sample of other nearby clusters, we find an increase in\nthe activity level of galaxies belonging to the third system (hereafter, the\n``Group''). Specifically, the Group has relatively more star formation than\nboth the primary cluster and main subcluster. The position of the Group is also\ncoincident with the observed cluster radio relic.

Our model gives\nthe distribution of disk scale-heights for galaxies of different luminosities.\nFor L* spiral galaxies, it predicts a median disk thickness of only 5% of the\nradial scale-length if substructure is the only source of heating. The median\ndisk thickness increases to nearly 20% of the radial scale-length when heating\ndue to gravitational scattering of stars by molecular clouds is also included.\nThe latter value is close to the thickness estimated observationally for the\ndisk of the Milky Way galaxy.

Since it is\nvery difficult to measure $\\alpha$ in general, we use a Monte Carlo method to\nsimulate the properties of $\\gamma$-ray pulsars in our galaxy. We find that\nthis new outer gap model predicts many more weak $\\gamma$-ray pulsars. For all\nsimulated $\\gamma$-ray pulsars with self-sustained outer gaps, $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity $L_{\\gamma}$ satisfies $L_{\\gamma}\\propto L^{\\delta}_{sd}$; where\nthe value of $\\delta$ depends on the ensitivity of the $\\gamma$-ray detector. \n\n"}

These events manifest themselves in form of luminous flares\npowered by accretion of debris from the disrupted star into the black hole.\n  Candidate events among optically non-active galaxies emerged in the past few\nyears.

Minimal cooling is\ndistinguished from enhanced cooling by the absence of neutrino emission from\nany direct Urca process, due either to nucleons or to exotica.

Abstract: In a recent study of a search for enhancements from the galactic center with\nmuons at sea level using the TUPI muon telescope, we have found several ground\nlevel enhancements (GLEs) as very sharp peaks above the count rate background.\nThis paper reports a consistent analysis of two GLEs observed in December 2003\nand detected after an up-grade of the data acquisition system, which includes a\nnoise filter and which allows us to verify that the GLEs are not mere\nbackground fluctuations. The main target of this study is a search for the\norigin of the GLEs. The results show that one of them has a strong correlation\nwith a solar flare, while the other has an unknown origin, because there is\nneither a satellite report of a solar flare, nor prompt X-ray emission, and nor\na excess of nuclei during the raster scan where the GLE was observed. Even so,\ntwo possibilities are analyzed: the solar flare hypothesis and the gamma ray\nburst (GRB) hypothesis.

The source was observed simultaneously at TeV and\nX-ray energies, with supporting observations frequently carried out at optical\nand radio wavelengths. The large amount of simultaneous data has allowed us to\nexamine the variability of Mrk 421 in detail. The variabilities are generally\ncorrelated between the X-ray and gamma-ray bands, although the correlation\nappears to be fairly loose. The light curves show the presence of flares with\nvarying amplitudes on a wide range of timescales both at X-ray and TeV\nenergies. Of particular interest is the presence of TeV flares that have no\ncoincident counterparts at longer wavelengths, because the phenomenon seems\ndifficult to understand in the context of the proposed emission models for TeV\nblazars. We have also found that the TeV flux reached its peak days before the\nX-ray flux during a giant flare in 2004. Such a difference in the development\nof the flare presents a further challenge to the emission models. Mrk 421\nvaried much less at optical and radio wavelengths.

Analysis and\n  Discussion Abstract: We have performed an absorption-line survey of outflowing gas in 78\nstarburst-dominated, infrared-luminous galaxies. This is the largest study of\nsuperwinds at z < 3. Superwinds are found in almost all infrared-luminous\ngalaxies, and changes in detection rate with SFR--winds are found twice as\noften in ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) as in less-luminous\ngalaxies--reflect different wind geometries. The maximum velocities we measure\nare 600 km/s, though most of the outflowing gas has lower velocities (100-200\nkm/s). (One galaxy has velocities exceeding 1000 km/s.) Velocities in LINERs\nare higher than in HII galaxies, and outflowing ionized gas often has higher\nvelocities than the neutral gas. Wind properties (velocity, mass, momentum, and\nenergy) scale with galaxy properties (SFR, luminosity, and galaxy mass),\nconsistent with ram-pressure driving of the wind. Wind properties increase\nstrongly with increasing galactic mass, contrary to expectation. These\ncorrelations flatten at high SFR (> 10-100 M_sun/yr), luminosities, and masses.\nThis saturation is due to a lack of gas remaining in the wind's path, a common\nneutral gas terminal velocity, and/or a decrease in the efficiency of\nthermalization of the supernovae energy. It means that mass entrainment\nefficiency, rather than remaining constant, declines in galaxies with SFR > 10\nM_sun/yr and M_K < -24. Half of our sample consists of ULIRGs, which host as\nmuch as half of the star formation in the universe at z > 1. The powerful,\nubiquitous winds we observe in these galaxies imply that superwinds in massive\ngalaxies at redshifts above unity play an important role in the evolution of\ngalaxies and the intergalactic medium. \n\n"}

In this paper we apply statistical tests, the chi-square test and the\nF-test, to the Cepheid data from the MACHO project to test for a non-linearity\nof the V- and R-band PL relations at 10 days, and extend these tests to the\nnear infrared (JHK-band) PL relations with 2MASS data.

Moreover, the delay of the collapse produces a tendency for less\ndense regions to accrete less mass, with respect to a classical spherical\nmodel, inducing a biasing of over-dense regions toward higher mass. Finally we\ncalculate the bias coefficient using a selection function properly defined\nshowing that for a Standard Cold Dark Matter (SCDM) model this bias can account\nfor a substantial part of the total bias required by observations on cluster\nscales. \n\n"}

For the\ntime-averaged accretion rates typical of low-mass X-ray transients, standard\nneutrino cooling is unimportant and the core thermally re-radiates the\ndeposited heat. The resulting luminosity has the same magnitude as that\nobserved from several transient neutron stars in quiescence.

Thermal emission had previously been dismissed as a predominant\nsource of quiescent emission since blackbody spectral fits implied an emitting\narea much smaller than a neutron star's surface.

Kaiser, Squires, & Broadhurst (1995) proposed a method to calibrate\nthe ellipticity-shear relation in the presence of Point Spread Function (PSF)\nanisotropies and camera distortions. We revisit the KSB method and show that\nboth the PSF and the camera distortions can be corrected for using source\nmoments, as opposed to ellipticities. We clarify the applicability of some of\nthe approximations made in this method. We derive expressions for the\ncorrections which only involve the galaxy moments.

We discuss the\nshortcomings of the method, and test its validity using numerical simulations.\nAs an application of the method, we repeat the analysis of the HST WFPC2 camera\nperformed by Hoekstra et al.

The additional\ndissipation associated with these stresses is concentrated relatively close\noutside the marginally stable orbit, scaling as r to the -7/2 at large radius.\nAs a result of these additional stresses: spin-up of the central black hole is\nretarded; the maximum spin-equilibrium accretion efficiency is 36%, and occurs\nat a/M=0.94; the disk spectrum is extended toward higher frequencies; line\nprofiles (such as Fe K-alpha) are broadened if the line emissivity scales with\nlocal flux; limb-brightening, especially at the higher frequencies, is\nenhanced; and the returning radiation fraction is substantially increased, up\nto 58%.

The central accreting black hole is\nassumed to emit both a quasar-like spectrum, which is absorbed by the\nsurrounding gas, and a slow wind. The power in both is less than the Eddington\nlimit for the black hole. The wind however exerts the most force on the gas\nand, as earlier suggested by Silk & Rees, when the black hole reaches a\ncritical mass, it is powerful enough to eject the cold gas from the galaxy, so\nterminating the growth of both black hole and galaxy.

One possibility is a spontaneous change of phase\nfrom a lower-energy vacuum state to one of higher energy, as exemplified by an\nasymmetric double-well potential with different masses in each well. If the\nlower well is in resonance with oscillations of the potential, a system can be\ndriven resonantly to the upper well and stay there (except for tunneling) if\nthe upper well is not resonant.

Even if we start with the same\nminimal SO(10) model, we have different predictions for low-energy\nphenomenologies dependent on the types of seesaw mechanism. This is the case\nfor leptogenesis: it is shown that the type-I see-saw model gives a consistent\nscenario for the non-thermal leptogenesis but not for type-II. The predicted\ninflaton mass needed to produce the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe\nis found to be $M_I \\sim 5 \\times 10^{11}$ GeV for the reheating temperature\n$T_R = 10^6$ GeV. \n\n"}

One can instead have a distribution of particles which is in\nkinetic equilibrium and evolves adiabatically during this period.\nNumber-violating reactions which are required to establish chemical equilibrium\ncan become efficient only at much later times. We highlight some of the\nstriking consequences of such a quasi-thermal Universe.

As another consequence, the lower bound on the\nmass of the lightest right-handed (s)neutrino from thermal leptogenesis can be\n$\\gg 10^{9}$ GeV. Depending on the phase, a Wino or Higgsino considerably\nlighter than TeV, or a Bino in the bulk region, can be a viable {\\it thermal}\ndark matter candidate.

This ground state\nor \"true vacuum\" of the universe could be similar to the minimal supersymmetric\nstandard model with all the susy breaking parameters set to zero.\nAlternatively, it might be similar to the prominent superstring theories with\nnine flat space dimensions or to the supersymmetric anti-deSitter model that\nseems to be equivalent to a conformal field theory. We propose that the\ndominant phenomenological feature of these potential future universes is the\nweakening of the Pauli principle due to Fermi-Bose degeneracy. Providing the\nphase transition occurs in the cosmologically near future, an exact\nsupersymmetry could extend the life expectancy of intelligent civilizations far\nbeyond what would be possible in the broken susy universe. \n\n"}

We point out\nthat the lightest messenger sneutrinos with mass in the range of one to three\nTeV may serve as cold dark matter over most of the parameter space due to\none-loop electroweak radiative corrections. However, in the minimal model this\nmass range has been excluded by the direct dark matter searches. We propose a\nsolution to this problem by introducing terms that explicitly violate the\nmessenger number. This results in low detection rate for both direct and\nindirect searches and allows messenger sneutrinos to be a valid dark matter\ncandidate in a wide region of SUSY parameter space. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/0306170", "contents": "Title: The Black Hole Singularity in AdS/CFT Abstract: We explore physics behind the horizon in eternal AdS Schwarzschild black\nholes. In dimension d >3, where the curvature grows large near the singularity,\nwe find distinct but subtle signals of this singularity in the boundary CFT\ncorrelators. Building on previous work, we study correlation functions of\noperators on the two disjoint asymptotic boundaries of the spacetime by\ninvestigating the spacelike geodesics that join the boundaries. These dominate\nthe correlators for large mass bulk fields. We show that the Penrose diagram\nfor d>3 is not square. As a result, the real geodesic connecting the two\nboundary points becomes almost null and bounces off the singularity at a finite\nboundary time t_c \\neq 0. If this geodesic were to dominate the correlator\nthere would be a \"light cone\" singularity at t_c. However, general properties\nof the boundary theory rule this out. In fact, we argue that the correlator is\nactually dominated by a complexified geodesic, whose properties yield the large\nmass quasinormal mode frequencies previously found for this black hole. We find\na branch cut in the correlator at small time (in the limit of large mass),\narising from coincidence of three geodesics. The t_c singularity, a signal of\nthe black hole singularity, occurs on a secondary sheet of the analytically\ncontinued correlator. Its properties are computationally accessible. The t_c\nsingularity persists to all orders in the 1/m expansion, for finite \\alpha',\nand to all orders in g_s. Certain leading nonperturbative effects can also be\nstudied. The behavior of these boundary theory quantities near t_c gives, in\nprinciple, significant information about stringy and quantum behavior in the\nvicinity of the black hole singularity. \n\n"}
