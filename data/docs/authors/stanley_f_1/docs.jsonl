Whereas parallel update schemes have been studied extensively in past\nyears, the level of understanding of asynchronous updates schemes is still very\npoor. In this paper we study the propagation of external information given by\nregulatory input variables into a random Boolean network. We compute both\nanalytically and numerically the time evolution and the asymptotic behavior of\nthis propagation of external regulation (PER). In particular, this allows us to\nidentify variables which are completely determined by this external\ninformation. All those variables in the network which are not directly fixed by\nPER form a core which contains in particular all non-trivial feedback loops. We\ndesign a message-passing approach allowing to characterize the statistical\nproperties of these cores in dependence of the Boolean network and the external\ncondition.

Stochastic variations in metallicity arise because of the finite\nnumbers of supernova. We construct an analytic formulation of the combined\neffects of pre-enrichment and self-enrichment and use Monte Carlo models to\nverify that the model accurately encapsulates the mean metallicity and\nmetallicity spread among real GCs. The predicted metallicity spread due to\nself-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller than\nthe observed spread among real GCs.

First, even with fixed accretion physics, AGN are\ndiluted/less luminous relative to their hosts; the magnitude of this depends on\nhost properties and so on luminosity and redshift. Second, they may transition\nto a radiatively inefficient state, changing SED shape and dramatically\ndecreasing in optical/IR luminosity. These effects lead to differences in\nobserved AGN samples, even at fixed bolometric luminosity and after correction\nfor obscuration. The true Eddington ratio distribution may depend strongly on\nluminosity, but this will be seen only in surveys robust to dilution and\nradiative inefficiency (X-ray or narrow-line samples); selection effects imply\nthat AGN in optical samples will have uniformly high mdot. This also implies\nthat different selection methods yield systems with different hosts: the\nclustering of faint optical/IR sources will be weaker than that of X-ray\nsources, and optical/IR Seyferts will reside in more disk-dominated galaxies\nwhile X-ray selected Seyferts will preferentially occupy early-type systems. If\nobserved mdot distributions are correct, a large fraction of low-luminosity AGN\ncurrently classified as 'obscured' are in fact diluted and/or radiatively\ninefficient, not obscured by gas or dust. This is equally true if X-ray\nhardness is used as a proxy for obscuration, since radiatively inefficient SEDs\nnear mdot~0.01 are X-ray hard.

PAH molecules are\nmodeled as planar disks with in-plane and out-of-plane vibrational dipoles. As\nfirst pointed out by Leger (1988), infrared emission features resulting from\nin-plane and out-of-plane modes should have orthogonal polarization directions.\nWe show analytically how the degree of polarization depends on the viewing\ngeometry and the molecule's internal alignment between principal axis of\ninertia and angular momentum, which gets worse after photon absorption. Longer\nwavelength features, emitted after better internal alignment is recovered,\nshould be more strongly polarized. The degree of polarization for\nuni-directional illumination (e.g., by a star) is larger than for diffuse\nillumination (e.g., by a disk galaxy), all else being equal. For PAHs in the\nCold Neutral Medium, the predicted polarization is probably too small to\ndistinguish from the contribution of linear dichroism by aligned foreground\ndust. The level of polarization predicted for PAH emission from the Orion Bar\nis only ~0.06% at 3.3 microns; Sellgren et al.

The two components that we readily\nsee in edge-on Sb galaxies like NGC 4565 are a disk and a bar, but face-on SBb\ngalaxies always show a disk, a bar, and a (pseudo)bulge. Where is the\n(pseudo)bulge in NGC 4565? We use archival Hubble Space Telescope K-band and\nSpitzer Space Telescope 3.6 um images to penetrate the dust in NGC 4565. We\nfind a high surface brightness, central stellar component, distinct from the\nboxy bar and from the galaxy's disk. Its minor-axis profile has a Sersic index\nof 1.33+/-0.12, so it is a pseudobulge. The pseudobulge has the smallest scale\nheight (~90 pc) of any component in the galaxy, in contrast to ~740 pc for the\nboxy bar plus thin disk. The disky pseudobulge is also much less luminous than\nthe boxy bar, so the true (pseudo)bulge-to-total luminosity ratio of the galaxy\nis much less than previously thought. We infer that the pseudobulge-to-total\nluminosity ratios of edge-on galaxies with box-shaped bulges have generally\nbeen overestimated. Therefore more galaxies than we have recognized contain\nlittle or no evidence of a merger-built classical bulge. This challenges our\npicture of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering, because it is difficult\nto grow big galaxies without also making a big classical bulge. Solving the\npuzzle of the \"missing pseudobulge\" in NGC 4565 further increases our\nconfidence that we understand box-shaped bulges correctly as edge-on bars. This\nsupports our developing picture of the formation of pseudobulges -- both\nedge-on bars and disky central components -- by secular evolution in isolated\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

Early results from 18 sources locate several spiral arms.\nThe Perseus spiral arm has a pitch angle of 16 +/- 3 degrees, which favors four\nrather than two spiral arms for the Galaxy.

By fitting the\nmeasurements to a model of the Galaxy, we estimate the distance to the Galactic\ncenter R_o = 8.4 +/- 0.6 kpc and a circular rotation speed Theta_o = 254 +/- 16\nkm/s. The ratio Theta_o/R_o can be determined to higher accuracy than either\nparameter individually, and we find it to be 30.3 +/- 0.9 km/s/kpc, in good\nagreement with the angular rotation rate determined from the proper motion of\nSgr A*. The data favor a rotation curve for the Galaxy that is nearly flat or\nslightly rising with Galactocentric distance.

In all other cases the growth of thermal perturbations is\nsuppressed by a combination of buoyancy and thermal conduction. Even if the\nentropy profile were nearly flat, cold clouds with sizes smaller than 10 kpc\ncould form in the corona of the Milky Way only at radii larger than 100 kpc, in\ncontradiction with the determined distances of the largest HVC complexes.\nClouds with sizes of a few kpc can form in the inner halo only in low-mass\nsystems.

Among\nthe many scientific applications for this data are the search for compact\ngalaxies. In this paper, we present the discovery of seven compact (but quite\nluminous) stellar systems, ranging from M32-like galaxies down to ultra-compact\ndwarfs (UCDs)/dwarf to globular transition objects (DGTOs). We find that all\nseven compact galaxies require a two-component fit to their light profile and\nhave measured velocity dispersions that exceed those expected for typical\nearly-type galaxies at their luminosity. From our structural parameter analysis\nwe conclude that three of the sample should be classified as compact\nellipticals or M32-like galaxies, the remaining four being less extreme\nsystems. The three compact ellipticals are all found to have old luminosity\nweighted ages (> 12 Gyr), intermediate metallicities (-0.6 < [Fe/H] < -0.1) and\nhigh [Mg/Fe] (> 0.25).

The purpose of\nthese observations, together with previously obtained observations with the\nSAURON IFU, is to determine the masses (Mbh) of the supermassive black holes\n(SMBH).

The origin of the radio emission is\nunclear,it could be due either to a jet, as in microquasars, or to the shock\nboundary between the Be star and a possible pulsar wind. We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before).

We find that satellites are older and metal-richer than centrals of the\nsame stellar mass. In addition, the slopes of the age-stellar mass and\nmetallicity-stellar mass relations are found to become shallower in denser\nenvironments. This is due to the fact that the average age and metallicity of\nlow mass satellite galaxies increase with the mass of the halo in which they\nreside. A comparison with the semi-analytical model of Wang et al. (2008) shows\nthat it succesfully reproduces the fact that satellites are older than centrals\nof the same stellar mass and that the age difference increases with the halo\nmass of the satellite. This is a consequence of strangulation, which leaves the\nstellar populations of satellites to evolve passively, while the prolonged star\nformation activity of centrals keeps their average ages younger. The resulting\nage offset is larger in more massive environments because their satellites were\naccreted earlier. The model fails, however, in reproducing the halo mass\ndependence of the metallicities of low mass satellites, yields\nmetallicity-stellar mass and age-stellar mass relations that are too shallow,\nand predicts that satellite galaxies have the same metallicities as centrals of\nthe same stellar mass, in disagreement with the data. We argue that these\ndiscrepancies are likely to indicate the need to (i) modify the recipes of both\nsupernova feedback and AGN feedback, (ii) use a more realistic description of\nstrangulation, and (iii) include a proper treatment of the tidal stripping,\nheating and destruction of satellite galaxies.

Their existence cannot be explained by the\nprocess of star formation or by dynamical interactions in the field, and their\norigin has long been a mystery. We explain the origin of these wide binaries by\nformation during the dissolution phase of young star clusters: an initially\nunbound pair of stars may form a binary when their distance in phase-space is\nsmall. Using N-body simulations, we find that the resulting wide binary\nfraction in the semi-major axis range 1000 au - 0.1 pc for individual clusters\nis 1-30%, depending on the initial conditions. The existence of numerous wide\nbinaries in the field is consistent with observational evidence that most\nclusters start out with a large degree of substructure. The wide binary\nfraction decreases strongly with increasing cluster mass, and the semi-major\naxis of the newly formed binaries is determined by the initial cluster size.\nThe resulting eccentricity distribution is thermal, and the mass ratio\ndistribution is consistent with gravitationally-focused random pairing. As a\nlarge fraction of the stars form in primordial binaries, we predict that a\nlarge number of the observed 'wide binaries' are in fact triple or quadruple\nsystems. By integrating over the initial cluster mass distribution, we predict\na binary fraction of a few per cent in the semi-major axis range 1000 au - 0.1\npc in the Galactic field, which is smaller than the observed wide binary\nfraction.

We identify significant\nsystematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additional\ndiffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-ray\nhaze. To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the\nratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,\nand of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models\nand simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to\nunder-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate\nit at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend\ncrucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy.

We use a cosmological\nsimulation, as well as an analytical model, to investigate how and why the\nscaling relations for BHs evolve with cosmic time. We find that a simulation\nthat reproduces the observed redshift zero relations between m_BH and the\nproperties of its host galaxy, as well as the thermodynamic profiles of the\nintragroup medium, also reproduces the observed evolution in the ratio m_BH/m_s\nfor massive galaxies, although the evolution of the m_BH/sigma relation is in\napparent conflict with observations.

In this paper we put\nforward a different route to the macroscopic dynamics. We begin with the system\ndiscrete in both velocity space and time. We hypothesize that the alternating\nsteps of advection and relaxation, common to all lattice Boltzmann schemes,\ngive rise to a slow invariant manifold. We perform a time step expansion of the\ndiscrete time dynamics using the invariance of the manifold. Finally we\ncalculate the dynamics arising from this system. By choosing the fully discrete\nscheme as a starting point we avoid mixing approximations and arrive at a\ngeneral form of the microscopic dynamics up to the second order in the time\nstep. We calculate the macroscopic dynamics of two commonly used lattice\nschemes up to the first order, and hence find the precise form of the deviation\nfrom the Navier-Stokes equations in the dissipative term, arising from the\ndiscretization of velocity space. Finally we perform a short wave perturbation\non the dynamics of these example systems, to find the necessary conditions for\ntheir stability. \n\n"}

To examine these conflicting data and\npresent a possible resolution of this conflict. Methods.

The absorption spectra which, attributed to the atmosphere\nof the companion, yield an orbital speed of $\\sim$ 60 km s$^{-1}$ could well be\nattributable to absorption of light from the companion in material of the\ncircumbinary disk. Then the absorption spectra predict an orbital speed for the\ncircumbinary disk material of $\\sim$ 240 km s$^{-1}$, in agreement with the\nemission line data. Conclusions. If continuum light from the companion is\nabsorbed in passage through the circumbinary disk material rather than in the\natmosphere of the companion itself, the periodic Doppler shifts in the\nabsorption spectra are entirely consistent with observations of the\ncircumbinary disk and a system mass exceeding $\\sim$ 40 $M_\\odot$.

We use dust radiative transfer\nmodels to constrain the internal luminosity of L673-7, defined to be the\nluminosity of the central source and excluding the luminosity from external\nheating, to be 0.01-0.045 solar luminosities, with 0.04 solar luminosities the\nmost likely value.

We find that globally, these tracers of\nstar formation give a range of results of ~6-11\\msun/yr, with the\ndust-corrected FUV giving the highest value of SFR. We can reconcile the UV and\nIR-based estimates by adopting a steeper UV extinction curve that lies in\nbetween the starburst (Calzetti) and SMC extinction curves. However, the\nregions of highest SFR intensity along the spiral arms are consistent with a\nstarburst-like extinction. Overall, the level of star-formation we find is\nhigher than previously published for this galaxy, by about a factor of two,\nwhich, contrary to previous conclusions, implies that the interaction that\ncaused the distorted morphology of NGC2442 likely also triggered increased\nlevels of star-formation activity.

Decoherence of a quantum superposition state arises from the\ninteraction between the constituent system and the uncontrolled degrees of\nfreedom in its environment. Within the standard Bloch-Redfield picture of\ntwo-level system dynamics, qubit decoherence is characterized by two rates: a\nlongitudinal relaxation rate Gamma1 due to the exchange of energy with the\nenvironment, and a transverse relaxation rate Gamma2 = Gamma1/2 + Gamma_phi\nwhich contains the pure dephasing rate Gamma_phi. Irreversible energy\nrelaxation can only be mitigated by reducing the amount of environmental noise,\nreducing the qubit's internal sensitivity to that noise, or through multi-qubit\nencoding and error correction protocols (which already presume ultra-low error\nrates). In contrast, dephasing is in principle reversible and can be refocused\ndynamically through the application of coherent control pulse methods. In this\nwork we demonstrate how dynamical-decoupling techniques can moderate the\ndephasing effects of low-frequency noise on a superconducting qubit with\nenergy-relaxation time T1 = 1/Gamma1 = 12 us.

We estimate first the\nfraction of chaotic and regular orbits for the two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) case\n(where the galaxy extends only in the (x,y)-space) and show that it is a\nnon-monotonic function of the energy. For the three DOF extension of this model\n(in the z-direction), we give similar estimates, both by exploring different\nsets of initial conditions and by varying the model parameters, like the mass,\nsize and pattern speed of the bar.

After initially considering radio loudnesses derived using total\nradio luminosities, we repeat the investigation using core radio luminosities\nonly, applying a previously established mass correction for these core\nluminosities. In both cases, for Eddington ratios < 1 per cent, Fanaroff-Riley\ntype I and broad-line radio galaxies are on average more radio-loud than\nSeyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. However, the\ndistribution of radio loudnesses for the mass-corrected, core-only sample is\nmuch narrower than that of the clearly bimodal total radio loudness\ndistribution. The advantages and disadvantages of using core- or lobe-dominated\nradio luminosity as a measure of instantaneous jet power are discussed.

Optical counterparts were identified using the SuperCOSMOS database\nand redshifts were found from either the 6dF Galaxy survey or the literature.\nWe also report 144 new redshifts. For AT20G sources outside the Galactic plane,\n78.5% have optical identifications and 30.9% have redshift information. The\noptical identification rate also increases with increasing flux density.\nTargets which had optical spectra available were examined to obtain a spectral\nclassification.\n  There appear to be two distinct AT20G populations; the high luminosity\nquasars that are generally associated with point-source optical counterparts\nand exhibit strong emission lines in the optical spectrum, and the lower\nluminosity radio galaxies that are generally associated with passive galaxies\nin both the optical images and spectroscopic properties. It is suggested that\nthese different populations can be associated with different accretion modes\n(cold-mode or hot-mode). We find that the cold-mode sources have a steeper\nspectral index and produce more luminous radio lobes, but generally reside in\nsmaller host galaxies than their hot-mode counterparts. This can be attributed\nto the fact that they are accreting material more efficiently. Lastly, we\ncompare the AT20G survey with the S-cubed semi-empirical (S3-SEX) models and\nconclude that the S3-SEX models need refining to correctly model the compact\ncores of AGN. The AT20G survey provides the ideal sample to do this. \n\n"}

One of the key questions is how\nthese disks form so close to their host black holes and under what condition\nthey form stars in a tidally stressed environment.

Restricting\nour sample to those lines of sight along which we do not detect elements of\ncold halo substructure (ECHOS), we compile the largest spectroscopic sample of\nstars in the smooth component of the halo ever observed in situ beyond 10 kpc.\nWe find significant spatial autocorrelation in [Fe/H] in the MPMSTO population\nin the distant half of our sample beyond about 15 kpc from the Galactic center.\nInside of 15 kpc however, we find no significant spatial autocorrelation in\n[Fe/H]. At the same time, we perform SEGUE-like observations of N-body\nsimulations of Milky Way analog formation. While we find that halos formed\nentirely by accreted satellite galaxies provide a poor match to our\nobservations of the halo within 15 kpc of the Galactic center, we do observe\nspatial autocorrelation in [Fe/H] in the simulations at larger distances. This\nobservation is an example of statistical chemical tagging and indicates that\nspatial autocorrelation in metallicity is a generic feature of stellar halos\nformed from accreted satellite galaxies. \n\n"}

The deep Ha surveys reach ~3M_sun/yr out to\nz=2.2 for the first time, while the wide area and the coverage over two\nindependent fields allow to greatly overcome cosmic variance. A total of 1742,\n637, 515 and 807 Ha emitters are homogeneously selected at z=0.40, 0.84, 1.47\nand 2.23, respectively, and used to determine the Ha luminosity function and\nits evolution. The faint-end slope is found to be -1.60+-0.08 over z=0-2.23,\nshowing no evolution. The characteristic luminosity of SF galaxies, L*, evolves\nsignificantly as log[L*(z)]=0.45z+log[L*(z=0)]. This is the first time Ha has\nbeen used to trace SF activity with a single homogeneous survey at z=0.4-2.23.\nOverall, the evolution seen in Ha is in good agreement with the evolution seen\nusing inhomogeneous compilations of other tracers of star formation, such as\nFIR and UV, jointly pointing towards the bulk of the evolution in the last 11\nGyrs being driven by a strong luminosity increase from z~0 to z~2.2. Our\nuniform analysis reveals an Ha star formation history of the Universe which can\nbe simply parameterised by log(SFRD)=-2.1/(1+z) for z<2.23. Both the shape and\nnormalisation of the Ha star formation history are consistent with the\nmeasurements of the stellar mass density growth, confirming that our Ha\nanalysis traces the bulk of the formation of stars in the Universe up to z~2.2.\nStar formation activity since z~2.2 is responsible for ~95% of the total\nstellar mass density observed locally today (with half being assembled between\nz=1.2-2.2, and the rest since z<1.2). \n\n"}

The wings are spatially resolved at high\nsignificance level (5-11 sigma), indicating that the molecular outflow extends\non the kpc scale. The CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratio of the red broad wings is\nconsistent with the ratio observed in the narrow core, while the blue broad\nwing is less excited than the core. The latter result suggests that quasar\ndriven outflow models invoking shocks (which would predict higher gas\nexcitation) are not appropriate to describe the bulk of the outflow in Mrk231.\nHowever, we note that within the central 700 pc the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratio of\nthe red wing is slightly, but significantly, higher than in the line core,\nsuggesting that shocks may play a role in the central region.

However, annealing at T=488K=Tp increases Tc up to 33.3 K, sharpens the\nsuperconducting transition, increases the lower critical field, and strengthens\nthe screening efficiency of the applied magnetic field.

Detection of the Galactic haze with\n  Planck Abstract: Using precise full-sky observations from Planck, and applying several methods\nof component separation, we identify and characterize the emission from the\nGalactic \"haze\" at microwave wavelengths. The haze is a distinct component of\ndiffuse Galactic emission, roughly centered on the Galactic centre, and extends\nto |b| ~35 deg in Galactic latitude and |l| ~15 deg in longitude. By combining\nthe Planck data with observations from the WMAP we are able to determine the\nspectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematic\nbiases present in previous analyses. The derived spectrum is consistent with\npower-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excluding\nfree-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrum\nsynchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (number\ndensity per energy) dN/dE ~ E^-2.1.

To disentangle different\nsynchrotron models and place constraints on source magnetic field, age and\nenergetics, we also performed a detailed spectral analysis of M87 extended\nradio-halo using these observations together with archival data. We do not find\nany sign of new extended emissions; on the contrary the source appears well\nconfined by the high pressure of the intra-cluster medium.

We analyze the rest-frame U-B color\ncorrelations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies in\nthe redshift range 0.5< z<0.8 from the DEEP2/AEGIS survey. We find that Sersic\nindex (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters and\nresembles a step-function with a threshold value of n=2.3. There exists,\nhowever, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high n\nvalues that seem to contradict this behavior. We hypothesize that their Sersic\nvalues may be distorted by bursts of star formation, AGNs, and/or poor fits,\nleading us to consider central surface stellar mass density as an alternative\nto Sersic index. Not only does it correct the outliers, it also forms a tight\nrelationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies is\nmost physically linked with quenching. Furthermore, at z~0.65, the majority of\nthe blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since their\nGIM2D bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses of\nsimilar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass must\nabsolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench.

N-body methods are used to\ninvestigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions\nbetween cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs.

We find that a circular binary system with a\nmisaligned circumbinary disk normally produces a double peaked\nmass-accretion-rate variation per binary orbit. This is because each black hole\npasses across the circumbinary disk plane and captures gas twice in one orbital\nperiod. Even in misaligned systems, however, a single peaked\nmass-accretion-rate variation per binary orbit is produced, if the orbital\neccentricity is moderately large (e\\lesssim0.3). The number of peaks in mass\naccretion rates can be understood simply in terms of the orbital phase\ndependence of the distance between each binary black hole and its closest inner\nedge of the circumbinary disk. In the cases of eccentric binary black holes\nhaving different masses, the less massive black hole can get closer to the\ncircumbinary disk than the massive one, thus tidally splitting gas from its\ninner edge, but the created gas flows are comparably captured by both black\nholes with a short time delay.

We show that this correlation is\nsignificantly tightened if galaxies with central AGN emission are removed, but\nthe cosmic scatter of elliptical galaxies in both 24 and 70 micron luminosities\nremains significant along the correlation.

In some\nelliptical galaxies cold interstellar dust emitting at 70 and 160 microns may\narise from recent gas-rich mergers. However, we argue that most of the large\nrange of 70 micron luminosity in elliptical galaxies is due to dust transported\nfrom galactic cores by feedback events in (currently IR-quiet) active galactic\nnuclei.

The internal energy of such systems lacks extensivity and\nadditivity. Although the extensivity can be restored by scaling the interaction\npotential with the number of particles, the non-additivity still remains. Lack\nof additivity leads to inequivalence of statistical ensembles. Before relaxing\nto thermodynamic equilibrium, isolated systems with LR forces become trapped in\nout-of-equilibrium quasi-stationary state (qSS), the lifetime of which diverges\nwith the number of particles. Therefore, in thermodynamic limit LR systems will\nnot relax to equilibrium. The qSSs are attained through the process of\ncollisionless relaxation.

This metallicity\ncorrelation implies that outflows from BLRs carry metal-rich gas to NLRs at\ncharacteristic radial distances of ~ 1.0 kiloparsec. This chemical connection\nprovides evidence for a kinetic feedback of the outflows to their hosts. Metals\ntransported into the NLR enhance the cooling of the ISM in this region, leading\nto local star formation after the AGNs turn to narrow line LINERs.

Here we extend these results to different distances from the\nGalactic center, looking for variations of observables that can be related to\non-going and future spectroscopic surveys. By separating the effects of\nkinematic heating and radial migration, we show that migration is much more\nimportant, even for the oldest and hottest stellar population. The\ndistributions of stellar birth guiding radii and final guiding radii\n(signifying contamination from migration and heating, respectively) widen with\nincreasing distance from the Galactic center. As a result, the slope in the\nage-metallicity relation flattens significantly at Galactic radii larger than\nsolar. The radial metallicity and [Mg/Fe] gradients in our model show\nsignificant variations with height above the plane due to changes in the\nmixture of stellar ages. An inversion in the radial metallicity gradient is\nfound from negative to weakly positive (at r<10 kpc), and from positive to\nnegative for the [Mg/Fe] gradient, with increasing distance from the disk\nplane. We relate this to the combined effect of (i) the predominance of young\nstars close to the disk plane and old stars away from it, (ii) the more\nconcentrated older stellar component, and (iii) the flaring of mono-age disk\npopulations. We also investigate the effect of recycled gas flows on the mean\n[Fe/H] and find that in the region 4<r<12 kpc the introduced errors are less\nthan 0.05-0.1 dex, related to the fact that inward and outward flows mostly\ncancel in that radial range. We show that radial migration cannot compete with\nthe inside-out formation of the disk, exposed by the more centrally\nconcentrated older disk populations, and consistent with recent observations. \n\n"}

We find that there is more dust obscured star\nformation in the protocluster galaxies than in similarly selected control field\ngalaxies and there is tentative evidence of a higher fraction of starbursting\ngalaxies in the denser environment. However, on average we do not find a\ndifference between the star formation rate (SFR)-mass relations of the\nprotocluster and field galaxies and so conclude that the SFR of these galaxies\nat z~2.5 is governed predominantly by galaxy mass and not the host environment.\nWe also find that the stellar mass distribution of the protocluster galaxies is\nskewed towards higher masses and there is a significant lack of galaxies at M <\n10^10Msun within our small field of view.

We\npresent a picture in which the population of AGN can be divided into two\ndistinct populations. The Radiative-Mode AGN are associated with black holes\nthat produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of ~1% of\nthe Eddington Limit. They are primarily associated with less massive black\nholes growing in high-density pseudo-bulges at a rate sufficient to produce the\ntotal mass budget in these black holes in ~10 Gyr. The circum-nuclear\nenvironment contains high density cold gas and associated star-formation. Major\nmergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular\nprocesses appear dominant. Stellar feedback will be generic in these objects\nand strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGN. In Jet-Mode AGN\nthe bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows (jets).\nThese AGN are associated with the more massive black holes in more massive\n(classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies. Neither the accretion onto these\nblack holes nor star-formation in their host bulge is significant today. These\nAGN are probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas that is\nlimited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN radio sources.

We show that the presence of magnetic fields generated via the\nsmall-scale dynamo stabilises the protostellar disc and provides some degree of\nsupport against fragmentation. In the absence of magnetic fields, the\nfragmentation timescale in our model decreases by a factor of ~10 at the\ntransition from Z=0 to Z>0, with subsequently only a weak dependence on\nmetallicity.

We show that such a\nstatement is not precise. We introduce the concept of \\emph{gapped quantum\nliquid} as a special kind of gapped quantum states that can \"dissolve\" any\nproduct states on additional sites. Topologically ordered states actually\ncorrespond to gapped quantum liquids with stable ground-state degeneracy.\nSymmetry-breaking states for on-site symmetry are also gapped quantum liquids,\nbut with unstable ground-state degeneracy. (2) We point out that the\nuniversality classes of generalized local unitary (gLU) transformations\n(without any symmetry) contain both topologically ordered states and\nsymmetry-breaking states. This allows us to use a gLU invariant -- topological\nentanglement entropy -- to probe the symmetry-breaking properties hidden in the\nexact ground state of a finite system, which does not break any symmetry. This\nmethod can probe symmetry- breaking orders even without knowing the symmetry\nand the associated order parameters. (3) The universality classes of\ntopological orders and symmetry-breaking orders can be distinguished by\n\\emph{stochastic local (SL) transformations} (i.e.\\ \\emph{local invertible\ntransformations}): small SL transformations can convert the symmetry-breaking\nclasses to the trivial class of product states with finite probability of\nsuccess, while the topological-order classes are stable against any small SL\ntransformations, demonstrating a phenomenon of emergence of unitarity.

With such\nsmall scatter this star-formation main sequence (SFMS) has been interpreted as\ndeterministic and fundamental. Here we demonstrate that it is a simple\nconsequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by\napproximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a\nrandom walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at\nthe previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of\nstar-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for\nstochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are\ncorrelated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an\nexpectation that <SSFR> should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have\na relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. The derived SFMS and\nits evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy to\nconstrain cosmological parameters. The framework reproduces several important\nobservables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby\ndwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation.\nThe evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways\nto generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as\nmergers. The predicted dispersion in SSFR has consequences for the\nclassification of quiescent galaxies, as such galaxies have heterogeneous\nformation histories, and many may only be temporarily diminished in their\nstar-formation activity. The implied dispersion in SFHs, and the SFMS's\ninsensitivity to timescales of stochasticity, thus substantially limits the\nability to connect massive galaxies to their progenitors over long cosmic\nbaselines.

We note that this is not the case for dusty shells and\nclouds. Instead, if the shell or cloud is initially optically-thick to the UV\nemission from the source of luminosity L, then there is a significant boost in\nV that reflects the integral of the momentum absorbed as it is accelerated. For\nshells reaching a generalized Eddington limit, we show that V ~ (4R_UV L/M_sh\nc)^1/2, in both point-mass and isothermal-sphere potentials, where R_UV is the\nradius where the shell becomes optically-thin to UV photons, and M_sh is the\nmass of the shell. The asymptotic velocity significantly exceeds v_esc for\ntypical parameters, and can explain the ~1000-2000km/s outflows observed from\nrapidly star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei if the surrounding\nhalo has low gas density. Similarly fast outflows from massive stars can be\naccelerated on few - 10^3 yr timescales.

Consequently, the He$^{+}$\n1640 angstrom recombination line is expected to become much weaker. Supernova\nfeedback exhibits great variety due to the uncertainty in possible explosion\npathways.

Another basic tool\nto determine the mass of a system of stars or galaxies comes from the study of\ntheir motion, as Newton demonstrated with his law of gravitation, which yields\nthe {\\em gravitational mass}. Because the luminous mass can at best only\nrepresent a portion of the gravitational mass, finding the luminous mass to be\ndifferent or less than the gravitational mass should not be surprising. Using\nsuch an apparent discrepancy as a compelling evidence for the so-called dark\nmatter, which has been believed to possess mysterious nonbaryonic properties\nand present a dominant amount in galaxies and the universe, seems to be too far\na stretch when seriously examining the facts and uncertainties in the\nmeasurement techniques. In our opinion, a galaxy with star type distribution\nvarying from its center to edge may have a mass-to-light ratio varying\naccordingly.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data.

Important\nprocesses include: accretion (hot and cold mode, mergers), depletion (star\nformation, galactic winds, AGN), phase changes (ionised/atomic/molecular), and\nenvironmental effects (ram pressure stripping, tidal effects, strangulation).\nGoverning all of these to various extents is the underlying dark matter\ndistribution.

We construct model templates of galaxies using a stellar\npopulation synthesis code and apply Bayesian priors on physical properties such\nas stellar mass and star formation rate.

We demonstrate that the priors help reduce the\ndegeneracy and deliver significantly improved photometric redshifts.\nFurthermore, we show that a template error function, which corrects for\nsystematic flux errors in the model templates as a function of rest-frame\nwavelength, delivers further improvements. One great advantage of our technique\nis that we simultaneously measure redshifts and physical properties of galaxies\nin a fully self-consistent manner, unlike the two-step measurements with\ndifferent templates often performed in the literature.

We test this claim by performing a\ncounts-in-cells analysis of mock SMG catalogues derived from the Bolshoi\ncosmological simulation to investigate how well SMG associations trace the\nunderlying dark matter structure. We find that SMGs exhibit a relatively\ncomplex bias: some regions of high SMG overdensity are underdense in terms of\ndark matter mass, and some regions of high dark matter overdensity contain no\nSMGs. Because of their rarity, Poisson noise causes scatter in the SMG\noverdensity at fixed dark matter overdensity.

H$\\beta$ Time Lags and Implications for Super-Eddington Accretion Abstract: We have completed two years of photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of a\nlarge number of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with very high accretion rates.\nIn this paper, we report on the result of the second phase of the campaign,\nduring 2013--2014, and the measurements of five new H$\\beta$ time lags out of\neight monitored AGNs. All five objects were identified as super-Eddington\naccreting massive black holes (SEAMBHs). The highest measured accretion rates\nfor the objects in this campaign are $\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}\\gtrsim 200$, where\n$\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}= \\dot{M}_{\\bullet}/L_{\\rm Edd}c^{-2}$, $\\dot{M}_{\\bullet}$\nis the mass accretion rates, $L_{\\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity and $c$\nis the speed of light. We find that the H$\\beta$ time lags in SEAMBHs are\nsignificantly shorter than those measured in sub-Eddington AGNs, and the\ndeviations increase with increasing accretion rates. Thus, the relationship\nbetween broad-line region size ($R_{_{\\rm H\\beta}}$) and optical luminosity at\n5100\\AA, $R_{_{\\rm H\\beta}}-L_{5100}$, requires accretion rate as an additional\nparameter.

We examine radii ~0.1-100 pc around a black hole (BH), where the\naccretion rate onto the BH is determined and where AGN-powered winds and\nradiation couple to the ISM. We conclude: (1) The BH accretion rate is\ndetermined by exchange of angular momentum between gas and stars in\ngravitational instabilities. This produces accretion rates ~0.03-1 Msun/yr,\nsufficient to power luminous AGN. (2) The gas disk in the galactic nucleus\nundergoes an initial burst of star formation followed by several Myrs where\nstellar feedback suppresses the star formation rate (SFR). (3) AGN winds\ninjected at small radii with momentum fluxes ~L/c couple efficiently to the ISM\nand have dramatic effects on ISM properties within ~100 pc.

We present a\nstatistical study of the filamentary structure of the 353 GHz Planck Stokes\nmaps at high Galactic latitude, relevant to the study of dust emission as a\npolarized foreground to the CMB. We filter the intensity and polarization maps\nto isolate filaments in the range of angular scales where the power asymmetry\nbetween E-modes and B-modes is observed. Using the Smoothed Hessian Major Axis\nFilament Finder, we identify 259 filaments at high Galactic latitude, with\nlengths larger or equal to 2\\deg\\ (corresponding to 3.5 pc in length for a\ntypical distance of 100 pc). These filaments show a preferred orientation\nparallel to the magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky, derived\nfrom their polarization angles. We present mean maps of the filaments in Stokes\nI, Q, U, E, and B, computed by stacking individual images rotated to align the\norientations of the filaments. Combining the stacked images and the histogram\nof relative orientations, we estimate the mean polarization fraction of the\nfilaments to be 11 %. Furthermore, we show that the correlation between the\nfilaments and the magnetic field orientations may account for the E and B\nasymmetry and the $C_{\\ell}^{TE}/C_{\\ell}^{EE}$ ratio, reported in the power\nspectra analysis of the Planck 353 GHz polarization maps.

We show that, in the\npresence of a galactic bar, gas in a disc in the central regions of a galaxy\nwill be driven inwards by angular momentum transport induced by acoustic\ninstabilities within the bar's inner Lindblad resonance. This transport process\ndrives turbulence within the gas that temporarily keeps it strongly\ngravitationally stable and prevents the onset of rapid star formation. However,\nat some point the rotation curve must transition from approximately flat to\napproximately solid body, and the resulting reduction in shear reduces the\ntransport rates and causes gas to build up, eventually producing a\ngravitationally-unstable region that is subject to rapid and violent star\nformation. For the observed rotation curve of the Milky Way, the accumulation\nhappens $\\sim 100$ pc from the centre of the Galaxy, in good agreement with the\nobserved location of gas clouds and young star clusters in the CMZ.

Abstract: The galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) is nearly time-independent\nfor $z < 4$. We therefore construct a time-independent SHMR model for central\ngalaxies, wherein the in-situ star formation rate (SFR) is determined by the\nhalo mass accretion rate (MAR), which we call Stellar-Halo Accretion Rate\nCoevolution (SHARC). We show that the $\\sim0.3$ dex dispersion of the halo MAR\nmatches the observed dispersion of the SFR on the star-formation main sequence\n(MS). In the context of \"bathtub\"-type models of galaxy formation, SHARC leads\nto mass-dependent constraints on the relation between SFR and MAR. Despite its\nsimplicity and the simplified treatment of mass growth from mergers, the SHARC\nmodel is likely to be a good approximation for central galaxies with $M_*=10^9-\n10^{10.5}M_\\odot$ that are on the MS, representing most of the star formation\nin the Universe.

They are a ubiquitous feature of the simulated clouds, which appear\nfrom the beginning of the simulation and are not formed by gradual\nfragmentation of larger filaments. Most of the sub-filaments are\ngravitationally sub-critical and do not fragment into cores, however, there is\nalso a significant fraction of supercritical sub-filaments which break up into\nstar-forming cores. The sub-filaments are coherent along their length, and the\nresidual velocities along their spine show that they are subsonically\ncontracting without any ordered rotation on scales of ~0.1 pc.

This is the first source from the\nPlanck catalogue of high-z candidates that has been completely characterised\nwith follow-up observations from the optical to the sub-millimetre domain.\nHerschel/SPIRE observations at 250, 350 and 500 microns reveal the existence of\nfive sources producing a 500 microns emission excess that spatially corresponds\nto the candidate proto-clusters discovered by Planck. Further observations at\nCFHT in the optical bands (g and i) and in the near infrared (J, H and K_s),\nplus mid infrared observations with IRAC/Spitzer (at 3.6 and 4.5 microns)\nconfirm that the sub-mm red excess is associated with an over-density of\ncolour-selected galaxies. Follow-up spectroscopy of 13 galaxies with\nVLT/X-Shooter establishes the existence of two high-z structures: one at z~1.7\n(three confirmed member galaxies), the other at z~2.0 (six confirmed members).\nThis double structure is also seen in the photometric redshift analysis of a\nsample of 127 galaxies located inside a circular region of 1'-radius containing\nthe five Herschel/SPIRE sources, where we found a double-peaked excess of\ngalaxies at z~1.7 and z~2.0 with respect to the surrounding region.

Controlled formation simulations of isolated galaxies can\nreproduce all of these profile types by varying a single parameter, the initial\nhalo spin.

We\nfocus on the total infrared luminosity from the cold-dust component\n(L_IR^(cd)), whose emission can be described by a modified black body (MBB) of\na single temperature (T_mbb). An object on the (L_IR^(cd), T_mbb) plane can be\nexplained by the equivalent of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a MBB with an\neffective radius of R_eff. We show that R_eff is a good measure of the combined\nsize of the dusty starbursting regions (DSBRs) of the host galaxy. In at least\none case where the individual DSBRs are well resolved through strong\ngravitational lensing, R_eff is consistent with the direct size measurement. We\nshow that the observed L_IR-T relation is simply due to the limited R_eff (<~ 2\nkpc). The small R_eff values also agree with the compact sizes of the DSBRs\nseen in the local universe. However, previous interferometric observations to\nresolve high-z dusty starbursting galaxies often quote much larger sizes.

Our progenitor is a massive,\nlate-type galaxy similar to the Milky Way, composed of an exponential disk and\nan NFW dark matter halo. We place the galaxy on four different orbits in a\nVirgo-like cluster and evolve it for 10 Gyr. As a reference case we also evolve\nthe same model in isolation. Tidally induced bars form on all orbits soon after\nthe first pericenter passage and survive until the end of the evolution. They\nappear earlier, are stronger, longer and have lower pattern speeds for tighter\norbits. Only for the tightest orbit the properties of the bar are controlled by\nthe orientation of the tidal torque from the cluster at pericenters. The\nmechanism behind the formation of the bars is the angular momentum transfer\nfrom the galaxy stellar component to its halo. All bars undergo extended\nperiods of buckling instability that occur earlier and lead to more pronounced\nboxy/peanut shapes when the tidal forces are stronger. Using all simulation\noutputs of galaxies at different evolutionary stages we construct a toy model\nof the galaxy population in the cluster and measure the average bar strength\nand bar fraction as a function of clustercentric radius.

In the recent Guo et\nal (2011) and Fu et al (2013) semi-analytic + N-body models, the gaseous\nenvironment of the satellite galaxy is governed by the properties of the dark\nmatter subhalo in which it resides. This quantity depends of the resolution of\nthe N-body simulation, leading to a divergent fraction of quenched satellites\nin high- and low-resolution simulations. Here, we incorporate an analytic model\nto trace the subhaloes below the resolution limit. We demonstrate that we then\nobtain better converged results between the Millennium I and II simulations,\nespecially for the satellites in the massive haloes ($\\rm log\nM_{halo}=[14,15]$). We also include a new physical model for the ram-pressure\nstripping of cold gas in satellite galaxies. However, we find very clear\ndiscrepancies with observed trends in quenched satellite galaxy fractions as a\nfunction of stellar mass at fixed halo mass. At fixed halo mass, the quenched\nfraction of satellites does not depend on stellar mass in the models, but\nincreases strongly with mass in the data. In addition to the over-prediction of\nlow-mass passive satellites, the models also predict too few quenched central\ngalaxies with low stellar masses, so the problems in reproducing quenched\nfractions are not purely of environmental origin.

In this\npaper we present the deep photometry inside two square degrees around the\nbright galaxy NGC1399 in the core of the cluster. We found a very extended and\ndiffuse envelope surrounding the luminous galaxy NGC1399: we map the surface\nbrightness out to 33 arcmin (~ 192 kpc) from the galaxy center and down to\nabout 31 mag/arcsec^2 in the g band. The deep photometry allows us to detect a\nfaint stellar bridge in the intracluster region between NGC1399 and NGC1387. By\nanalyzing the integrated colors of this feature, we argue that it could be due\nto the ongoing interaction between the two galaxies, where the outer envelope\nof NGC1387 on its east side is stripped away. By fitting the light profile, we\nfound that it exists a physical break radius in the total light distribution at\nR=10 arcmin (~58 kpc) that sets the transition region between the bright\ncentral galaxy and the outer exponential stellar halo. We discuss the main\nimplications of this work on the build-up of the stellar halo at the center of\nthe Fornax cluster. By comparing with the numerical simulations of the stellar\nhalo formation for the most massive BCGs, we find that the observed stellar\nhalo mass fraction is consistent with a halo formed through the multiple\naccretion of progenitors with a stellar mass in the range 10^8 - 10^11 M_sun.\nThis might suggest that the halo of NGC1399 has also gone through a major\nmerging event. The absence of a significant number of luminous stellar streams\nand tidal tails out to 192 kpc suggests that the epoch of this strong\ninteraction goes back to an early formation epoch. Therefore, differently from\nthe Virgo cluster, the extended stellar halo around NGC1399 is characterised by\na more diffuse and well-mixed component, including the ICL. \n\n"}

Illustris galaxies display similar relations to those observed.\nUtilizing our knowledge of simulated formation histories, and leveraging the\nlarge simulation volume, we construct galaxy samples of satellites and centrals\nthat are matched in formation histories. This allows us to find that ~1/3 of\nthe metallicity-environment correlation is due to different formation histories\nin different environments. This is a combined effect of satellites (in\nparticular, in denser environments) having on average lower z=0 star formation\nrates (SFRs), and of their older stellar ages, even at a given z=0 SFR. Most of\nthe difference, ~2/3, however, is caused by the higher concentration of\nstar-forming disks of satellite galaxies, as this biases their SFR-weighted\nmetallicities toward their inner, more metal-rich parts. With a newly defined\nquantity, the 'radially averaged' metallicity, which captures the metallicity\nprofile but is independent of the SFR profile, the metallicities of satellites\nand centrals become environmentally independent once they are matched in\nformation history.

Even with\nour limited dynamical range, we find a trend for low-mass galaxies to exhibit\nshallower rotation curve inner slopes than high-mass galaxies, whereas steep\ninner slopes are found exclusively in high-mass galaxies. This trend may arise\nfrom the relationship between the total stellar mass and the mass of the bulge,\nwhich are correlated among them.

In the bin with the smallest H$\\beta$ width, objects with the bluest\nslopes that are similar to accretion disk predictions are found to have\nEW(NaID)=0, supporting the line-of-sight dust hypothesis. This conclusion is\nalso supported by the dependence of the $H\\alpha/H\\beta$ line ratio on\nalpha_opt. The implied relationship between alpha_opt and dust reddening is\ngiven by E(B-V)~0.2(-0.1-alpha_opt), and the implied reddening of a typical\ntype 1 AGN with alpha_opt=-0.5 is E(B-V)~0.08mag.

This\nseparation occurs because the diffuse gas experiences ram pressure forces while\nthe effectively collisionless galaxies (and presumably their associated dark\nmatter halos) do not.

The exception is the $^{13}$CO\ncolumn density method. It is affected by chemical and optical depth issues, and\nit measures both the true H$_{2}$ column density distribution and the molecular\nmass poorly.

This is explained by a\nsystematically lower virial parameter (i.e. closer to equilibrium) in the\nCO-emitting regions; in CO emission, clouds might seem (sub-)virial, even when,\nin fact, they are expanding or being dispersed. A single CO-to-H$_{2}$\nconversion factor appears to be a robust choice over relatively wide ranges of\ncloud conditions, unless the metallicity is low.

Recent galaxy formation simulations\nhave demonstrated the need for active CR transport either in the form of\ndiffusion or streaming to successfully launch winds in galaxies. However, due\nto computational limitations, most previous simulations have modeled CR\ntransport isotropically. Here, we discuss high resolution simulations of\nisolated disk galaxies in a $10^{11}\\rm{M_\\odot}$ halo with the moving mesh\ncode {\\sc Arepo} that include injection of CRs from supernovae, advective\ntransport, CR cooling, and CR transport through isotropic or anisotropic\ndiffusion.

Moreover, we find that isotropic diffusion allows most of the CRs to\nquickly diffuse out of the disk, while in the simulation with anisotropic\ndiffusion, most CRs remain in the disk once the magnetic field becomes\ndominated by its azimuthal component, which occurs after $\\sim 300\\,{\\rm\nMyrs}$. This has important consequences for the gas dynamics in the disk. In\nparticular, we show that isotropic diffusion strongly suppresses the\namplification of the magnetic field in the disk compared to anisotropic or no\ndiffusion models.

Abstract: Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is widely considered to be the\nmain driver in regulating the growth of massive galaxies through heating or\ndriving gas out of the galaxy, preventing further increase in stellar mass.\nObservational proof for this scenario has, however, been scarce. We have\nassembled a sample of 132 radio-quiet type-2 and red AGN at 0.1<z<1. We measure\nthe kinematics of the AGN-ionized gas, the host galaxies' stellar masses and\nstar formation rates and investigate the relationships between AGN\nluminosities, specific star formation rates (sSFR) and outflow strengths W90 --\nthe 90\\% velocity width of the [OIII]5007 line power and a proxy for the\nAGN-driven outflow speed. Outflow strength is independent of sSFR for AGN\nselected on their mid-IR luminosity, in agreement with previous work\ndemonstrating that star formation is not sufficient to produce the observed\nionized gas outflows which have to be powered by AGN activity. More\nimportantly, we find a negative correlation between W90 and sSFR in the AGN\nhosts with the highest SFRs, i.e., with the highest gas content, where\npresumably the coupling of the AGN-driven wind to the gas is strongest. This\nimplies that AGN with strong outflow signatures are hosted in galaxies that are\nmore `quenched' than galaxies with weaker outflow signatures. Despite the\ngalaxies' high SFRs, we demonstrate that the outflows are not star-formation\ndriven but indeed due to AGN-powering. This observation is consistent with the\nAGN having a net suppression, `negative' impact, through feedback on the\ngalaxies' star formation history. \n\n"}

Since most of the elements visible in\nX-rays are formed by type Ia (SNIa) and/or core-collapse (SNcc) supernovae,\nmeasuring their abundances gives us direct information on the nucleosynthesis\nproducts of billions of SNe since the epoch of the star formation peak (z~2-3).\nIn this study, we compare the most accurate average X/Fe abundance ratios\n(compiled in a previous work from XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS observations of 44\ngalaxy clusters, groups, and ellipticals), representative of the chemical\nenrichment in the nearby ICM, to various SNIa and SNcc nucleosynthesis models\nfound in the literature. The use of a SNcc model combined to any favoured\nstandard SNIa model (deflagration or delayed-detonation) fails to reproduce our\nabundance pattern. In particular, the Ca/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios are significantly\nunderestimated by the models. We show that the Ca/Fe ratio can be reproduced\nbetter, either by taking a SNIa delayed-detonation model that matches the\nobservations of the Tycho supernova remnant, or by adding a contribution from\nthe Ca-rich gap transient SNe, whose material should easily mix into the hot\nICM.

In either case, the fraction of SNIa over\nthe total number of SNe (SNIa+SNcc) contributing to the ICM enrichment ranges\nwithin 29-45%.

These are characterised by exceptionally large\nAGN radio fluxes, indicating high CR yields and associated CR heating rates. We\nsuggest a self-regulation cycle of AGN feedback in which non-RMH clusters are\nheated by streaming CRs homogeneously throughout the central cooling region. We\npredict {\\em radio micro halos} surrounding the AGNs of these CR-heated\nclusters in which the primary emission may predominate the hadronically\ngenerated emission. Once the CR population has streamed sufficiently far and\nlost enough energy, the cooling rate increases, which explains the increased\nstar formation rates in clusters hosting RMHs.

This is not a newly discovered relation. Rather,\nit improves on the many previous studies of it, with more and better data. Like\nits precedents, it bears crucial ramifications for the observed dynamical\nanomalies in disc galaxies, and, in particular, on their resolution by the MOND\nparadigm. Their result, indeed, constitute a triumph for MOND. However, unlike\nprevious analyses of the MDAR, McGaugh et al. have chosen to obfuscate the MOND\nroots of their analysis, and its connection with, and implications for, this\nparadigm. For example, the fitting formula they use, seemingly as a result of\nsome unexplained inspiration, follows in its salient properties from the basic\ntenets of MOND, and has already been used in the past in several MOND analyses.\nNo other possible origin for such a function is known. Given that this formula\nhad already been shown to reproduce correctly the observed rotation curves from\nthe baryon distribution (as a MOND effect), it must have been clear, a priory,\nthat it should describe correctly the MDAR, which is but a summary of rotation\ncurves. The present paper corrects these oversights -- bringing to light the\ndeep connections with MOND, suppressed by McGaugh et al. It also gives due\ncredit to previous works, and discusses some new, important, but less known,\naspects of this MOND relation. (Substantially abridged.) \n\n"}

The\nradiation from the unresolved circum-BH disc is analytically modeled\nconsidering self-shadowing effect.

Here we analyse the stability of a large sample of nearby\nstar-forming spirals treating molecular gas, atomic gas and stars as three\ndistinct components, and using radial profiles of sigma_CO and sigma_HI derived\nfrom HERACLES and THINGS observations. We show that the radial variations of\nsigma_CO and sigma_HI have a weak effect on the local stability level of galaxy\ndiscs, which remains remarkably flat and well above unity, but is low enough to\nensure (marginal) instability against non-axisymmetric perturbations and gas\ndissipation.

By using\nthe disc stability condition as a function of perturbation wavelength and\ndistance from the galaxy centre we calculate the effective disc stability\nparameters and the least stable wavelengths at different distances. For this we\nutilise a mass distribution model of M31 with four disc components (old and\nyoung stellar discs, cold and warm gaseous discs) embedded within the external\npotential of the bulge, the stellar halo and the dark matter halo.

Our 8-10 GHz observations do not find evidence\nfor the presence of thermal radio jets, and constrain the radio jet/wind flux\nto at least 90 times lower than the expected value from the previously reported\nbolometric luminosity-radio luminosity correlation. The emission at $>$29 GHz\nmay be dominated by the two spatially unresolved sources, which are located\nimmediately around FU Ori and its companion FU Ori S, respectively. Their\ndeconvolved radii at 33 GHz are only a few au. The 8-346 GHz SEDs of FU Ori and\nFU Ori S cannot be fit by constant spectral indices (over frequency). The more\nsophisticated models for SEDs suggest that the $>$29 GHz emission is\ncontributed by a combination of free-free emission from ionized gas, and\nthermal emission from optically thick and optically thin dust components.

Our objective is to identify the heating mechanisms in one\nsuch galaxy, IZw18, and assess the diagnostic value of fine-structure cooling\nlines. We also seek to constrain the mass of H$_2$, which, despite being an\nimportant catalyst and tracer of star formation, remains elusive in this\nobject. Building on a previous photoionization model within a multi-sector\ntopology, we provide additional constraints from the [CII] and [OI] lines and\nthe dust mass recently measured with Herschel. The heating of the HI region\nappears to be mainly due to photoionization by radiation from a bright X-ray\nbinary source, while photoelectric effect (PE) is negligible. The [CII] and\n[OI] lines imply an average X-ray luminosity of $4\\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$,\nwhile the [NeV] upper limits bring strong constraints to the soft X-ray flux\narising from the binary.

In this scenario, favorable conditions for the\ninspiral of a black hole binary are initiated by its gravitational interaction\nwith a distant companion, rather than by a common-envelope phase invoked in\nstandard binary evolution models. We use a code that follows self-consistently\nthe evolution of massive triple stars, combining the secular triple dynamics\n(Lidov-Kozai cycles) with stellar evolution. After a black hole triple is\nformed, its dynamical evolution is computed using either the orbit-averaged\nequations of motion, or a high-precision direct integrator for triples with\nweaker hierarchies for which the secular perturbation theory breaks down. Most\nblack hole mergers in our models are produced in the latter non-secular\ndynamical regime. We derive the properties of the merging binaries and compute\na black hole merger rate in the range (0.3- 1.3) Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}, or up to\n~2.5Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1} if the black hole orbital planes have initially random\norientation. Finally, we show that black hole mergers from the triple channel\nhave significantly higher eccentricities than those formed through the\nevolution of massive binaries or in dense star clusters. Measured\neccentricities could therefore be used to uniquely identify binary mergers\nformed through the evolution of triple stars. While our results suggest up to\n~10 detections per year with Advanced-LIGO, the high eccentricities could\nrender the merging binaries harder to detect with planned space based\ninterferometers such as LISA. \n\n"}

This leads to the signature of the b/p bulge in the\nthick disc to be weaker and further away from the plane than in the thin disc.\nRegarding the kinematics, we find that the los velocity of thick disc stars in\nthe outer parts of the b/p bulge can be \\emph{larger} than that of thin disc\nstars, by up to 40\\% and 20\\% for side-on and Milky Way-like orientations of\nthe bar respectively.

We study in detail how\nionizing radiation can leak from high redshift galaxies. For this purpose, we\nuse a series of high resolution radiation hydrodynamics simulations, zooming on\nthree dwarf galaxies in a cosmological context.

As\nfield galaxies have an H I covering fraction of ~100% at similar radii, the\ndearth of CGM H I in our data indicates that the cluster environment has\neffectively stripped or overionized the gaseous halos of these cluster\ngalaxies.

In contrast, common\n'fully-thermal' (energy-dump) or 'fully-kinetic' (particle-kicking) schemes in\nthe literature depend strongly on resolution: when applied at mass resolution\n>100 solar masses, they diverge by orders-of-magnitude from the converged\nsolution.

Abstract: The assembly of the Milky Way bulge is an old topic in astronomy, one now in\na period of renewed and rapid development. The dominant scenario for bulge\nformation is that of the Milky Way as a nearly pure disk galaxy, with the inner\ndisk having formed a bar and buckled. This can potentially explain virtually\nall bulge stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.0, comprising 95% of the stellar population.\nThe evidence is the incredible success in N-body models of this type in making\nmeaningful predictions, such as the rotation curve and velocity dispersion\nmeasured from radial velocities, and the spatial morphologies of the\npeanut/X-shape and the long bar. The classical bulge scenario remains viable\nfor stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.0 and potentially a minority of the other stars. A\nclassical bulge is expected from Lambda-CDM cosmological simulations, can\naccentuate the properties of an existing bar in a hybrid system, and is most\nconsistent with the bulge abundance trends such as [Mg/Fe], which are elevated\nrelative to both the thin and thick disks. Finally, the clumpy-galaxy scenario\nis considered, as it is the correct description of most Milky Way precursors\ngiven observations of high-redshift galaxies. Simulations predict that these\nstar-forming clumps will sometimes migrate to the centres of galaxies where\nthey may form a bulge, and galaxies often include a bulge clump as well. They\nwill possibly form a bar with properties consistent with those of the Milky\nWay, such as the exponential profile and metallicity gradient. Given the\nrelative successes of these scenarios, the Milky Way bulge is plausibly of\ncomposite origin, with a classical bulge and/or inner halo numerically dominant\nfor stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.0, a buckling thick disk for stars with -1.0 <~\n[Fe/H] <~ -0.50 perhaps descended from the clumpy galaxy phase, and a buckling\nthin disk for stars with [Fe/H] >~ -0.50. \n\n"}

One popular BLR model is the disk-wind model that\noffers a geometric unification of a quasar based on the angle of viewing. We\nconstruct a simple kinematical disk-wind model with a narrow outflowing wind\nangle. The model is combined with radiative transfer in the Sobolev, or high\nvelocity, limit. We examine how angle of viewing affects the observed\ncharacteristics of the emission line, especially the line widths and velocity\noffsets. The line profiles exhibit distinct properties depending on the\norientation, wind opening angle, and region of the wind where the emission\narises.\n  At low inclination angle (close to face-on), we find the shape of the\nemission line is asymmetric with narrow width and significantly blueshifted. As\nthe inclination angle increases (close to edge-on), the line profile becomes\nmore symmetric, broader, and less blueshifted. Additionally, lines that arise\nclose to the base of the disk wind, near the accretion disk, tend to be broad\nand symmetric. The relative increase in blueshift of the emission line with\nincreasing wind vertical distance is larger for polar winds compared with\nequatorial winds. By considering the optical thickness of the wind,\nsingle-peaked line profiles are recovered for the intermediate and equatorial\noutflowing wind. The model is able to reproduce a faster response in either the\nred and blue sides of the line profile found in reverberation mapping studies.\nA quicker response in the red side is achieved in the model with a polar wind\nand intermediate wind opening angle at low viewing angle.

Based on the apparent angular size, DES 3,\nwith a value of $r_\\mathrm{h}\\sim 0.\\!^{\\prime}3$, is among the smallest faint\nstar clusters known to date. Furthermore, using deeper imaging of DES\nJ0222.7$-$5217 taken with the SOAR telescope, we update structural parameters\nand perform the first isochrone modeling. Our analysis yields the first age\n($\\simeq 12.6\\,\\mathrm{Gyr}$) and metallicity ($\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\\simeq -2.01$)\nestimates for this object.

As\nemerged in the recent picture of the top-down multiphase condensation, the hot\ngaseous halos are tightly linked to all other phases in terms of cospatiality\nand thermodynamics. While hot halos (10^7 K) are perturbed by subsonic\nturbulence, warm (10^4 K) ionized and neutral filaments condense out of the\nturbulent eddies. The peaks condense into cold molecular clouds (< 100 K)\nraining in the core via chaotic cold accretion (CCA). We show all phases are\ntightly linked via the ensemble (wide-aperture) velocity dispersion along the\nline of sight. The correlation arises in complementary long-term AGN feedback\nsimulations and high-resolution CCA runs, and is corroborated by the combined\nHitomi and new IFU measurements in Perseus cluster.

The\nAGN sample is COMPLETE with respect to radio selection at all z<3.5. Out of 704\nAGN, 272 have a counterpart in the Herschel maps. By exploiting the better\nstatistics of the new sample, we confirm the results of Magliocchetti et al.\n(2014): the probability for a radio-selected AGN to be detected at FIR\nwavelengths is both a function of radio luminosity and redshift, whereby\npowerful sources are more likely FIR emitters at earlier epochs. Such an\nemission is due to star-forming processes within the host galaxy. FIR emitters\nand non-FIR emitters only differentiate in the z<1 universe. At higher\nredshifts they are indistinguishable from each other, as there is no difference\nbetween FIR-emitting AGN and star-forming galaxies. Lastly, we focus on radio\nAGN which show AGN emission at other wavelengths. We find that MIR emission is\nmainly associated with ongoing star-formation and with sources which are\nsmaller, younger and more radio luminous than the average parent population.\nX-ray emitters instead preferentially appear in more massive and older\ngalaxies. We can therefore envisage an evolutionary track whereby the first\nphase of a radio-active AGN and of its host galaxy is associated with MIR\nemission, while at later stages the source becomes only active at radio\nwavelengths and possibly also in the X-ray. \n\n"}

The simulated galaxies have more extended morphologies and larger\nsizes when measured using rest-frame optical B-band light than rest-frame UV\nlight; sizes measured from stellar mass surface density are even larger. The UV\nmorphologies are usually dominated by several small, bright young stellar\nclumps that are not always associated with significant stellar mass. The B-band\nlight traces stellar mass better than the UV, but it can also be biased by the\nbright clumps. At all redshifts, galaxy size correlates with stellar\nmass/luminosity with large scatter. The half-light radii range from 0.01 to 0.2\narcsec (0.05-1 kpc physical) at fixed magnitude. At z>5, the size of galaxies\nat fixed stellar mass/luminosity evolves as (1+z)^{-m}, with m~1-2.

A prime example is the Fermi gas with\nunitarity limited interactions, whose universal properties are relevant to\nsystems ranging from atomic gases at microkelvin temperatures to the inner\ncrust of neutron stars. Here we address the question of whether unitary Bose\nsystems can possess a similar universality. We consider the simplest strongly\ninteracting Bose system, where we have an impurity particle (\"polaron\")\nresonantly interacting with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Focusing on the\nground state of the equal-mass system, we use a variational wave function for\nthe polaron that includes up to three Bogoliubov excitations of the BEC, thus\nallowing us to capture both Efimov trimers and associated tetramers. Unlike the\nFermi case, we find that the length scale associated with Efimov trimers (i.e.,\nthe three-body parameter) can strongly affect the polaron's behaviour, even at\nboson densities where there are no well-defined Efimov states. However, by\ncomparing our results with recent quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we argue\nthat the polaron energy is a \\emph{universal} function of the Efimov three-body\nparameter for sufficiently low boson densities. We further support this\nconclusion by showing that the energies of the deepest bound Efimov trimers and\ntetramers at unitarity are universally related to one another, regardless of\nthe microscopic model.

The effects of label sparsity on\nthe classification capacity of manifolds are elucidated, revealing a scaling\nrelation between label sparsity and manifold radius. Theoretical predictions\nare corroborated by numerical simulations using recently developed algorithms\nto compute maximum margin solutions for manifold dichotomies. Our theory and\nits extensions provide a powerful and rich framework for applying statistical\nmechanics of linear classification to data arising from neuronal responses to\nobject stimuli, as well as to artificial deep networks trained for object\nrecognition tasks. \n\n"}

We\nfind that although very close fly-bys are required to obtain the observed\nproperties of Pr 0211c, such fly-bys are relatively common due to the high\nstellar density and longevity of the cluster. Such close fly-bys are most\nfrequent during the first 1-2 Myr after cluster formation, corresponding to a\ncluster age $\\leq$ 3 Myr. During the first 2 to 3 Myr about 6.5% of stars\nactually experience a fly-by that would lead to such a small system-size as\nobserved for Pr0211 or even smaller.

When only radiative cooling is\nconsidered, the temperature of the dense shocked gas rapidly drops below the\ndust condensation temperature. However, by accounting for the heating of the\npostshock gas by the downstream radiation from the shock, we show that dust\nformation is inhibited until the radiation from the shock weakens, as the shock\npropagates into the less dense outer regions of the CSM.

Spectroscopy of\ngamma-ray burst afterglows can be used to determine the neutral hydrogen\ncolumn-density in their host galaxies and hence the opacity to extreme\nultra-violet radiation along the lines-of-sight to the bursts. Thus, making the\nreasonable assumption that long-duration GRB locations are representative of\nthe sites of massive stars that dominate EUV production, one can calculate an\naverage escape fraction of ionizing radiation in a way that is independent of\ngalaxy size, luminosity or underlying spectrum. Here we present a sample of NH\nmeasures for 138 GRBs in the range 1.6<z<6.7 and use it to establish an average\nescape fraction at the Lyman limit of <fesc>~0.005, with a 98% confidence upper\nlimit of ~0.015. This analysis suggests that stars provide a small contribution\nto the ionizing radiation budget of the IGM at z<5, where the bulk of the\nbursts lie. At higher redshifts, z>5, firm conclusions are limited by the small\nsize of the GRB sample, but any decline in average HI column-density seems to\nbe modest. We also find no indication of a significant correlation of NH with\ngalaxy UV luminosity or host stellar mass, for the subset of events for which\nthese are available. We discuss in some detail a number of selection effects\nand potential biases. Drawing on a range of evidence we argue that such\neffects, while not negligible, are unlikely to produce systematic errors of\nmore than a factor ~2, and so would not affect the primary conclusions. Given\nthat many GRB hosts are low metallicity, high specific star-formation rate,\ndwarf galaxies, these results present a particular problem for the hypothesis\nthat such galaxies dominated the reionization of the universe. \n\n"}

Accounting for the fact that most star formation is clustered\nalleviates this problem. Super-bubbles driven by the combined effects of\nclustered SNe propagate rapidly enough to break out of galactic discs well\nbefore the clusters' SNe stop going off. The radiative losses post-breakout are\nreduced dramatically and a large fraction ($\\gtrsim 0.2$) of the energy\nreleased by SNe vents into the halo powering a strong galactic wind.

Here, we\nstudy a mechanism of superconductivity in heavy fermion systems, by focusing on\nthe impact of vertex corrections (VCs) for the pairing interaction going beyond\nthe Migdal approximation. In heavy fermion systems, strong interference between\nmultipole fluctuations cause significant VCs, that represent many-body effects\nbeyond mean-field-type approximations. Especially, the coupling constants\nbetween electrons and charged-bosons, including the electron-phonon coupling\nconstant, are strongly magnified by the VCs.

In\nparticular, phonon-mediated superconductivity is expected to be realized near\nthe magnetic criticality, thanks to the VCs due to magnetic multipole\nfluctuations.

To robustly compare\nmodel predictions with the observed fluxes of product particles, most analyses\nof astrophysical data -- which are generally frequentist -- rely on estimating\nthe abundance of DM by calculating the so-called $\\textit{J-factor}$. This\nquantity is usually inferred from the kinematic properties of the stellar\npopulation of a dSph using Jeans equation, commonly by means of Bayesian\ntechniques which entail the presence (and additional systematic uncertainty) of\nprior choice. Here, extending earlier work, we develop a scheme to derive the\nprofile likelihood for $J$-factors of dwarf spheroidals for models with five or\nmore free parameters.

The model involves an impulse\nby a fast encounter, after which the stream grows a loop of stars at different\norbital energies.

A correction for\ndust attenuation, A_UV, is needed for these measurements. This correction is\ntypically inferred from UV spectral slopes (beta) using an equation known as\n\"Meurer's Relation.\" In this paper, we study this relation at a redshift of 1.5\nusing images and photometric measurements in the rest-frame UV (HST) through\nmid-infrared (Spitzer). It is shown that massive star-forming galaxies (above\n10^10 Msun) have dust corrections that are dependent on their inclination to\nthe line-of-sight. Edge-on galaxies have higher A_UV and infrared excess\n(IRX=L(IR)/L(UV)) than face-on galaxies at a given beta. Interestingly, dust\ncorrections for low-mass star-forming galaxies do not depend on inclination.\nThis is likely because more massive galaxies have more disk-like\nshapes/kinematics, while low-mass galaxies are more prolate and have more\ndisturbed kinematics. To account for an inclination-dependent dust correction,\na modified Meurer's Relation is derived: A_UV=4.43+1.99 beta - 1.73 (b/a-0.67),\nwhere b/a is the galaxy axis ratio. This inclination-dependence of A_UV can be\nexplained by a two-component model of the dust distribution inside galaxies. In\nsuch a model, the dust attenuation of edge-on galaxies has a higher\ncontribution from a \"mixture\" component (dust uniformly mixed with stars in the\ndiffuse interstellar medium), and a lower contribution from a \"birth cloud\"\ncomponent (near-spherical dust shells surrounding young stars in H II regions)\nthan that of face-on galaxies. The difference is caused by the larger\npath-lengths through disks at higher inclinations. \n\n"}

Individual trajectories show that galaxies cease mass growth\nwithin roughly three virial radii of the main group. Single galaxies continue\nto form stars until the group virial radius is crossed, when they begin to lose\nboth dark matter and gas.

In this work we discuss\nmechanisms that lead to the formation of two spatially segregated metallicity\npopulations. Using a set of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of Local\nGroup-like environments, we select a sample of satellite and field galaxies,\nspanning the stellar mass range $10^6-10^9$M$_{\\odot}$, that exhibit bimodality\nin their metallicity distributions. Among those, we identify a subsample with a\nstrong spatial segregation in the two populations. We find three distinct\nmechanisms for their formation. In field dwarfs and in a small fraction of\nsatellites, a merger causes the metal-poor stars to migrate to larger radii and\nencourages the available gas to sink to the centre of the dwarf.

In~this study, we showed that $r_s$, $M_s$, and the X-ray\ntemperature of the intracluster medium (ICM), $T_X$, form a thin plane in the\nspace of $(\\log r_s, \\log M_s, \\log T_X)$. This tight correlation indicates\nthat the ICM temperature is also determined by the formation time of individual\nclusters.

The\nformer one exists only when the function V(\\rho) that monitors the relaxation\nof grains assumes a cut off at the closed packed density, \\rho_c, with\nV(\\rho_c)=0, while the latter one exists for any form of V.
