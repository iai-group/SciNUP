Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

It was originally estimated that only one or two\nof the essential evolutionary steps had to have been hard in this sense, but it\nhas become apparent that this figure may need upward revision, because recent\nstudies of climatic instability suggest that the possible future duration of\nour biologically favourable environment may be shorter than had been supposed,\nonly about one Giga year rather than five. On the basis of the statistical\nrequirement of roughly equal spacing between hard steps, it is argued that the\nbest fit with the fossil record is now obtainable by postulating the number of\nhard steps to be five, if our evolution was exclusively terrestrial, or six if,\nas now seems very plausible, the first step occurred on Mars. \n\n"}

No absorption features at\nnegative velocities strongly argue against the widely-used large distance of 19\nto 21 kpc for Kes 75, and show that Kes 75 is within the Solar circle, i.e. a\ndistance $d<$13.2 kpc.

Indeed, merely a single case of a star-planet-disk\nsystem has previously been detected at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths.\nConsequently, one of our aims is to understand the reasons for these poor\nstatistics, i.e., whether these results reflected the composition and/or the\nphysics of the planetary disks or were simply due to observational bias and\nselection effects. Finding more examples would be very significant. The\nselected target, q1 Eri, is a solar-type star, which was known to possess a\nplanet, q1 Eri b, and to exhibit excess emission at IRAS wavelengths, but had\nremained undetected in the millimeter regime. Therefore, submm flux densities\nwould be needed to better constrain the physical characteristics of the\nplanetary disk. Consequently, we performed submm imaging observations of q1\nEri. The detected dust toward q1 Eri at 870 micron exhibits the remarkable fact\nthat the entire SED, from the IR to mm-wavelengths, is fit by a single\ntemperature blackbody function (60 K). This would imply that the emitting\nregions are confined to a narrow region (ring) at radial distances much larger\nthan the orbital distance of q1 Eri b, and that the emitting particles are\nconsiderably larger than some hundred micron. However, the 870 micron source is\nextended, with a full-width-half-maximum of roughly 600 AU. Therefore, a\nphysically more compelling model also invokes a belt of cold dust (17 K),\nlocated at 300 AU from the star and about 60 AU wide.

Such binaries form after major galaxy\nmergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering\nbecomes very inefficient at sub-parsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary\ndynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the orbits of binaries embedded within\ngeometrically thin gas discs.

We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good\nagreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation\nof eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e > 0.35. Accretion onto\nthe black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital\nfrequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of\nbinary decay that is possible without fragmentation occuring within the\nsurrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar\ndynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 10^5 < M/Msun < 10^8\nwe find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~\n0.01--0.1 pc, where the disc is optically thick.

Dark matter particles that end up within two virial\nradii of a Milky-Way-sized DM halo at $z=0$ have an approximately Gaussian\ndistribution in log(f) at early redshifts, but the distribution becomes\nincreasingly skewed at lower redshifts. The value corresponding to the peak of\nthe Gaussian decreases as the evolution progresses and is well described by a\npower-law in (1+z). The highest values of f are found at the centers of dark\nmatter halos and subhalos, where f can be an order of magnitude higher than in\nthe center of the main halo.

By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show that such discs fragment within a few thousand years, and\nproduce mainlybrown dwarf (BDs) stars, but also planetary mass (PM) stars and\nvery low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a\nfew Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these\ndiscs if they remain bound to the primary star.

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass. This model successfully\nreproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in the\ncomoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies.

In fact, the addition of a new contribution accounting for the\ngas can increase the statistical significance of the lensing model. We propose\na parametric method for strong lensing analyses which exploits multi-wavelength\nobservations.

First, giant stars\nwith planets do not show a metallicity distribution skewed towards metal-rich\nobjects, as found for dwarfs. Second, the correlation with metallicity is not\nvalid at intermediate metallicities, for which it can be shown that giant\nplanets are preferentially found orbiting thick disk stars.\n  None of these two peculiarities is explained by the proposed scenarios of\ngiant planet formation. We contend that they are galactic in nature, and\nprobably not linked to the formation process of giant planets. It is suggested\nthat the same dynamical effect, namely the migration of stars in the galactic\ndisk, is at the origin of both features, with the important consequence that\nmost metal-rich stars hosting giant planets originate from the inner disk, a\nproperty that has been largely neglected until now.

This implies that, at z ~ 0, or at low luminosity AGN levels,\nthere is an anti-correlation between Gamma and L/Ledd, opposite to the trend\nexhibited by high z AGN (quasars).

First, a\nkinematical model is constructed for SN Ia 2003hv, which can account for the\nmain features in its optical, Near-Infrared (NIR), and Mid-Infrared (Mid-IR)\nlate-time spectra. It is found that an asymmetric off-center model can explain\nthe observed characteristics of SN 2003hv. This model includes a relatively\nhigh density, Fe-rich region which displays a large velocity off-set, and a\nrelatively low density, extended 56Ni-rich region which is more spherically\ndistributed. The high density region consists of the inner stable Fe-Ni region\nand outer 56Ni-rich region. Such a distribution may be the result of a\ndelayed-detonation explosion, in which the first deflagration produces the\nglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, while the subsequent detonation can\nlead to the bulk spherical symmetry. This configuration, if viewed from the\ndirection of the off-set, can consistently explain the blueshift in some of the\nemission lines and virtually no observed shift in other lines in SN 2003hv. For\nthis model, we then explore the effects of different viewing angles and the\nimplications for SNe Ia in general. The model predicts that a variation of the\ncentral wavelength, depending on the viewing angle, should be seen in some\nlines (e.g., [Ni II]7378), while the strongest lines (e.g., [Fe III] blend at\n4700A) will not show this effect.

Though frenetic, the observations constitute a\n\"controlled experiment\", which permits measurement of absolute planet\nfrequency. High-mag events are rare, but the high-mag channel is efficient:\nhalf of high-mag events were successfully monitored and half of these yielded\nplanet detections. The planet frequency derived from microlensing is a factor 7\nlarger than from RV studies at factor ~25 smaller separations [2<P<2000 days].\nHowever, this difference is basically consistent with the gradient derived from\nRV studies (when extrapolated well beyond the separations from which it is\nmeasured). This suggests a universal separation distribution across 2 dex in\nsemi-major axis, 2 dex in mass ratio, and 0.3 dex in host mass. Finally, if all\nplanetary systems were \"analogs\" of the Solar System, our sample would have\nyielded 18.2 planets (11.4 \"Jupiters\", 6.4 \"Saturns\", 0.3 \"Uranuses\", 0.2\n\"Neptunes\") including 6.1 systems with 2 or more planet detections. This\ncompares to 6 planets including one 2-planet system in the actual sample,\nimplying a first estimate of 1/6 for the frequency of solar-like systems. \n\n"}

The\nresults are consistent with Gaussian simulations of the the best-fitting\ncosmological model, but deviate from the previous results determined using the\nWMAP1 data. We show that it is unlikely that the improved skeleton tracing\nmethod, the omission of Q-band data, the modification of the\nforeground-template fitting method or the absence of 6 extended regions in the\nnew mask contribute to such a deviation. However, the application of the Kp0\nbase-mask in data processing does improve the consistency with the WMAP1\nresults.\n  The f_NL-likelihoods of the data are estimated at 9 different smoothing\nlevels. It is unexpected that the best-fit values show positive correlation\nwith the smoothing scales. Further investigation argues against a point-source\nor goodness-of-fit explanation but finds that about 30% of either Gaussian or\nf_NL samples having better goodness-of-fit than the WMAP5 show a similar\ncorrelation. We present the estimate f_NL=47.3+/-34.9 (1sigma error) determined\nfrom the first four smoothing angles and f_NL=76.8+/-43.1 for the combination\nof all nine. The former result may be overestimated at the 0.21sigma-level\nbecause of point sources. \n\n"}

Observations of copper abundances rely on a very limited\nnumber of lines, the strongest are the Cu I lines of Mult. 1 at 324.7 nm and\n327.3 nm which can be measured even at extremely low metallicities. Aims. We\ninvestigate the quality of these lines as abundance indicators. Method. We\nmeasure these lines in two turn-off (TO) stars in the Globular Cluster NGC 6752\nand two TO stars in the Globular Cluster NGC 6397 and derive abundances with 3D\nhydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the CO5BOLD code. These\nabundances are compared to the Cu abundances measured in giant stars of the\nsame clusters, using the lines of Mult. 2 at 510.5 nm and 578.2 nm. Results.\nThe abundances derived from the lines of Mult. 1 in TO stars differ from the\nabundances of giants of the same clusters. This is true both using CO5BOLD\nmodels and using traditional 1D model atmospheres. The LTE 3D corrections for\nTO stars are large, while they are small for giant stars. Conclusions. The Cu I\nresonance lines of Mult. 1 are not reliable abundance indicators. It is likely\nthat departures from LTE should be taken into account to properly describe\nthese lines, although it is not clear if these alone can account for the\nobservations.

We find that the average LAT gamma-ray spectrum of\nMrk 501 can be well described by a single power-law function with a photon\nindex of 1.78 +/- 0.03. While we observe relatively mild flux variations with\nthe Fermi-LAT (within less than a factor of 2), we detect remarkable spectral\nvariability where the hardest observed spectral index within the LAT energy\nrange is 1.52 +/- 0.14, and the softest one is 2.51 +/- 0.20.

Importantly,\nthese environments consist just of electrons and ions and the dissipated energy\nalways stays with the plasma. In contrast, in this paper I introduce a new\ndirection of research, motivated by several important problems in high-energy\nastrophysics --- reconnection in high energy density (HED) radiative plasmas,\nwhere radiation pressure and radiative cooling become dominant factors in the\npressure and energy balance. I identify the key processes distinguishing HED\nreconnection: special-relativistic effects; radiative effects (radiative\ncooling, radiation pressure, and Compton resistivity); and, at the most extreme\nend, QED effects, including pair creation. I then discuss the main\nastrophysical applications --- situations with magnetar-strength fields\n(exceeding the quantum critical field of about 4 x 10^13 G): giant SGR flares\nand magnetically-powered central engines and jets of GRBs.

The optimization is performed by\nminimizing several volume integrals which would vanish for an exact\nRobertson-Walker metric. Covariance is automatic. Foliation of space-time is\npart of the optimization procedure. Only the metric is involved in the\nprocedure, no assumptions about the origin of the energy-momentum tensor are\nneeded. A scale factor does not show up during the optimization process, the\noptimal scale factor is determined at the end. The general formulation is non\nperturbative. An explicit perturbative treatment is possible. The shifts which\nlead to the optimal coordinates obey Euler-Lagrange equations which are\nformulated and solved in first order of the perturbation. The extension to\nsecond order is sketched, but turns out to be unnecessary. The only freedom in\nthe choice of coordinates which finally remains are the rigid transformations\nwhich keep the form of the Robertson-Walker metric intact, i.e. translations in\nspace and time, spatial rotations, and spatial scaling. Spatial averaging\nbecomes trivial. In first order of the perturbation there is no backreaction. A\nsimplified second order treatment results in a very small effect, excluding the\npossibility to mimic dark energy from backreaction.

These data are used to identify the physical conditions\ngiving rise to the H2O emission and infer any dependence with velocity. These\nobservations provide evidence that the observed water lines probe a warm\n(T_kin~400-600 K) and very dense (n 10^6 - 10^7 cm^-3) gas, not traced by other\nmolecules, such as low-J CO and SiO, but rather traced by mid-IR H2 emission.\nIn particular, H2O shows strong differences with SiO in the excitation\nconditions and in the line profiles in the two observed shocked positions,\npointing to chemical variations across the various velocity regimes and\nchemical evolution in the different shock spots. Physical and kinematical\ndifferences can be seen at the two shocked positions. At the R4 position, two\nvelocity components with different excitation can be distinguished, with the\ncomponent at higher velocity (R4-HV) being less extended and less dense than\nthe low velocity component (R4-LV). H2O column densities of about 2 10^13 and 4\n10^14 cm^-2 have been derived for the R4-LV and the R4-HV components,\nrespectively. The conditions inferred for the B2 position are similar to those\nof the R4-HV component, with H2O column density in the range 10^14 - 5 10^14\ncm^-2, corresponding to H2O/H2 abundances in the range 0.5 - 1 10^-5.

The\nhydrodynamics of the interaction between a jet and a clumpy wind is studied,\nfocusing on the global wind and single clump-jet interplay. We have performed,\nusing the code \\textit{Ratpenat}, three-dimensional numerical simulations of a\nclumpy wind interacting with a mildly relativistic jet, and of individual\nclumps penetrating into a jet. For typical wind and jet velocities, filling\nfactors of about > 0.1 are already enough for the wind to be considered as\nclumpy. An inhomogeneous wind makes the jet more unstable when crossing the\nsystem. Kinetic luminosities of the order 1.e37 erg/s allow the jet to reach\nthe borders of a compact binary with an O star, as in the smooth wind case,\nalthough with a substantially higher degree of disruption. When able to enter\ninto the jet, clumps are compressed and heated during a time of about their\nsize divided by the sound speed in the shocked clump.

One of the key questions is how\nthese disks form so close to their host black holes and under what condition\nthey form stars in a tidally stressed environment.

To search for additional blazar candidates\nwe have devised new diagnostic diagrams and found that known blazars occupy a\nregion of the log(S500{\\mu}m/S350{\\mu}m) vs. log(S500{\\mu}m/S1.4GHz) plane\nseparated from that of the other sub-mm sources with radio counterparts. Using\nthis diagnostic we have selected 12 further candidates that turn out to be\nscattered in the (r-z) vs. (u-r) plane or in the WISE colour-colour diagram\nproposed by Massaro et al. (2012), where known blazars are concentrated in well\ndefined strips. This suggests that the majority of them either are not blazars\nor have spectral energy distributions contaminated by their host galaxies. A\nsignificant fraction of true blazars are found to be hosted by star-forming\ngalaxies. This finding, supported by an analysis of blazars detected in Planck\n545 and 857 GHz bands, is at odds with the notion that blazar hosts are passive\nellipticals and indicates that the sub-mm selection is providing a novel\nprospect on blazar properties. Based on an inspection of the available\nphotometric data, including the WISE all-sky survey, the unpublished VIKING\nsurvey and new radio observations, we tentatively estimate that there are 11\nblazars with synchrotron flux density S500{\\mu}m > 35mJy over the considered\narea.

No\nprogenitor system has ever been identified either in the pre- or post-explosion\nimages of a Ia event. There have been recent claims for and against the\ndetection of ex-companion stars in several SNe Ia remnants. These studies,\nhowever, usually ignore the angular momentum gain of the progenitor WD, which\nleads to a spin-up phase and a subsequent spin-down phase before explosion. For\nspin-down timescales greater than 10^5 years, the donor star could be too dim\nto detect by the time of explosion.

For the stellar core collapse simulation, we present the\nlatest numerical results. We employed a purely nucleonic EOS (Shen-EOS). As an\ninitial condition, we adopted a 100 $M_{\\odot}$ presupernova model calculated\nby Umeda and Nomoto. Changing the degree of rotation for the initial condition,\nwe clarify the strong dependence of the outcome of the collapse on this. When\nthe rotation is rapid enough, the shock wave formed at the core bounce is\ndeformed to be a torus-like shape. Then, the infalling matter is accumulated in\nthe central region due to the oblique shock at the torus surface, hitting the\nPNS and dissipating the kinetic energy there. As a result, outflows can be\nlaunched. The PNS eventually collapses to a BH and an accretion torus is formed\naround it. We also found that the evolution of the BH and torus depends\nstrongly on the rotation initially given. In the BNS merger simulations, we in\naddition employ an EOS incorporating a degree of freedom for hyperons. The\nnumerical simulations show that for the purely nucleonic EOS, a HMNS with a\nlong lifetime ($\\gg 10$ ms) is the outcome for the total mass $M \\lesssim\n3.0M_{\\odot}$.

Assuming that the observed MIR\nemission is radiation from an accretion disk reprocessed in a surrounding dusty\ntorus that subtends a solid angle decreasing with increasing luminosity (as\ninferred from the declining fraction of obscured AGNs), the intrinsic disk\nluminosity, L_D, is approximately proportional to the luminosity of the corona\nin the 2-300 keV energy band, L_C, with the L_D/L_C ratio varying by a factor\nof 2.1 around a mean value of 1.6.

Only\nthree confirmed novae and three SSSs have been discovered in globular clusters\n(GCs) of any galaxy so far, of which one nova and two SSSs (including the nova)\nwere found in M 31 GCs. To study the SSS state of CNe we carried out a\nhigh-cadence X-ray monitoring of the M 31 central area with XMM-Newton and\nChandra. We analysed X-ray and optical data of a new transient X-ray source in\nthe M 31 GC Bol 126, discovered serendipitously in Swift observations. Our\noptical data set was based on regular M 31 monitoring programmes from five\ndifferent small telescopes. Additionally, we made use of Pan-STARRS 1 data\nobtained during the PAndromeda survey. Our observations reveal that the X-ray\nsource in Bol 126 is the third SSS in an M 31 GC and can be confirmed as the\nsecond CN in the M 31 GC system. This nova is named M31N 2010-10f. Its\nproperties in the X-ray and optical regimes agree with a massive white dwarf\n(M_WD >~ 1.3 M_sun) in the binary system. Incorporating the data on previously\nfound (suspected) novae in M 31 GCs we used our high-cadence X-ray monitoring\nobservations to estimate a tentative nova rate in the M 31 GC system of 0.05\n/yr/GC. An optical estimate, based on the recent 10.5-year WeCAPP survey, gives\na lower nova rate, which is compatible with the X-ray rate on the 95%\nconfidence level. There is growing evidence that the nova rate in GCs is higher\nthan expected from primordial binary formation and under conditions as in the\nfield. Dynamical binary formation and/or additional accretion from the\nintracluster medium are possible scenarios for an increased nova rate, but\nobservational confirmation for this enhancement has been absent, so far.\nRegular X-ray monitoring observations of M 31 provide a promising strategy to\nfind these novae. \n\n"}

This scenario is\nattractive for the progenitor systems of present-day massive globular clusters\n(GCs) which likely had masses M \\gtrsim 10^7\\msun. In such clusters, supernovae\nand stellar winds cannot provide a plausible explanation for the sudden removal\nof the primordial gas reservoir that is required to explain their complex\nchemical enrichment history.\n  In order to consider different regimes in the gas accretion rate onto\nstellar-mass BHs, we consider both the Bondi-Hoyle and Eddington\napproximations. For either model, our results show that the gas can be\nsignificantly depleted within only a few tens of Myrs. This process will affect\nthe distribution of BH masses, and may accelerate the dynamical decoupling of\nthe BH population and, ultimately, their dynamical ejection. Moreover, the\ntimescales for gas depletion are sufficiently short that the accreting BHs\ncould significantly affect the chemistry of subsequent star formation episodes.\n  The gas depletion times and final mass in BHs are sensitive to the assumed\nmodel for the accretion rate, and to the initial mass of the most massive BH\nwhich, in turn, is determined by the upper mass cut-off of the stellar IMF. Our\nresults imply that the remnant accretion history can have an important bearing\non the observed present-day cluster mass-to-light ratio.

Aims: We intended to find the X-ray coronal counterpart of the\nchromospheric cycle for i Hor. This represents the first X-ray cycle observed\nin an active star, as well as the paradigm of the first coronal cycles in the\nlife of a solar-like star. Methods: We monitored i Hor with XMM-Newton\nobservations spanning almost two years. The spectra of each observation are fit\nwith two-temperature coronal models to study the long-term variability of the\nstar. Results: We find a cyclic behavior in X-rays very similar to the\ncontemporaneous chromospheric cycle. The continuous chromospheric monitoring\nfor more than three cycle lengths shows a trend toward decreasing amplitude,\napparently modulated by a longer term trend. The second cycle is disrupted\nprior to reaching its maximum, followed by a brief episode of chaotic\nvariability before the cyclic behavior resumes, only to be disrupted again\nafter slightly more than one cycle. Conclusions: We confirm the presence of an\nactivity cycle of ~1.6 yr in i Hor both in X-rays and Ca II H&K. It is likely\nsubject to the modulation of a longer, not yet constrained second cycle. The\n1.6 yr cycle is the shortest coronal one observed to date, and i Hor represents\nthe most active star for which a coronal activity cycle has been found.

It has\nbeen found that most O-stars are multiples. HD 150 136 is the nearest system to\nEarth with >100 M_sol, and provides a unique opportunity to study an extremely\nmassive system. Recently, evidence for the existence of a third component in HD\n150 136, in addition to the tight spectroscopic binary that forms the main\ncomponent, was found in spectroscopic observations. Our aim was to image and\nobtain astrometric and photometric measurements of this component using long\nbaseline optical interferometry to further constrain the nature of this\ncomponent. We observed HD150136 with the near-infrared instrument AMBER\nattached to the ESO VLT Interferometer. The recovered closure phases are robust\nto systematic errors and provide unique information on the source asymmetry.\nTherefore, they are of crucial relevance for both image reconstruction and\nmodel fitting of the source structure. The third component in HD 150 136 is\nclearly detected in the high-quality data from AMBER. It is located at a\nprojected angular distance of 7.3 mas, or about 13 AU at the line-of-sight\ndistance of HD 150 136, at a position angle of 209 degrees East of North, and\nhas a flux ratio of 0.25 with respect to the inner binary. We resolved the\nthird component of HD 150 136 in J, H and K filters. The luminosity and color\nof the tertiary agrees with the predictions and shows that it is also an O\nmain-sequence star. The small measured angular separation indicates that the\ntertiary may be approaching the periastron of its orbit.

Recent studies have reported relatively weak\ncorrelations between observed AGN luminosities and the properties of AGN hosts,\nwhich has been interpreted to imply that there is no direct connection between\nAGN activity and star formation. However, AGNs may be expected to vary\nsignificantly on a wide range of timescales (from hours to Myr) that are far\nshorter than the typical timescale for star formation (>~100 Myr). This\nvariability can have important consequences for observed correlations. We\npresent a simple model in which all star-forming galaxies host an AGN when\naveraged over ~100 Myr timescales, with long-term average AGN accretion rates\nthat are perfectly correlated with the star formation rate (SFR). We show that\nreasonable prescriptions for AGN variability reproduce the observed weak\ncorrelations between SFR and L_AGN in typical AGN host galaxies, as well as the\ngeneral trends in the observed AGN luminosity functions, merger fractions, and\nmeasurements of the average AGN luminosity as a function of SFR.

This uncertainty stems from a dearth of observational\nconstraints as well as the great dynamic range between the small scales (<1 pc)\nwhere the feedback occurs and the large scales of galaxies (>1 kpc) that are\nshaped by this feedback. To bridge this divide, in this paper we aim to assess\nobservationally the role of stellar feedback at the intermediate scales of HII\nregions. In particular, we employ multiwavelength data to examine several\nstellar feedback mechanisms in a sample of 32 HII regions in the Large and\nSmall Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively). Using optical, infrared,\nradio, and X-ray images, we measure the pressures exerted on the shells from\nthe direct stellar radiation, the dust-processed radiation, the warm ionized\ngas, and the hot X-ray emitting gas. We find that the warm ionized gas\ndominates over the other terms in all of the sources, although two have\ncomparable dust-processed radiation pressures to their warm gas pressures. The\nhot gas pressures are comparatively weak, while the direct radiation pressures\nare 1-2 orders of magnitude below the other terms. We discuss the implications\nof these results, particularly highlighting evidence for hot gas leakage from\nthe HII shells and regarding the momentum deposition from the dust-processed\nradiation to the warm gas. Furthermore, we emphasize that similar observational\nwork should be done on very young HII regions to test whether direct radiation\npressure and hot gas can drive the dynamics at early times. \n\n"}

The predicted SFR\ndensity and how much of this is contributed by galaxies with different stellar\nmasses and infrared luminosities are in agreement with observations. The model\npredicts a modest evolution of the HI density at z<3, which is also in\nagreement with the observations. The HI density is predicted to be always\ndominated by galaxies with SFR<1Msun/yr. This contrasts with the H2 density,\nwhich is predicted to be dominated by galaxies with SFR>10Msun/yr. Current\nhigh-redshift galaxy surveys are limited to detect carbon monoxide in galaxies\nwith SFR>30Msun/yr, which in our model make up, at most, 20% of the H2 in the\nuniverse.

One component exhibits a sawtooth-like\nvelocity waveform while the other is nearly sinusoidal. One method of\ngenerating such a hybrid is presented: a nonlinear model is developed for the\nfirst overtone mode, which, if excited to large amplitude, is found to drop\nstrongly in frequency and become highly non-sinusoidal. If the frequency drops\nsufficiently to become equal to the fundamental frequency, the two can become\nphase locked and form the desired hybrid. A relationship is assumed between the\nhybrid mode velocity and the observed light curve, which is approximated as a\npower series. An accurate fit of the hybrid model is made to actual Kepler data\nfor RR Lyr. The sinusoidal component may tend to stabilize the period of the\nhybrid which is found in real Blazhko data to be extremely stable. It is\nproposed that the variations in amplitude and phase might result from a\nnonlinear interaction with a third mode, possibly a nonradial mode at 3/2 the\nfundamental frequency.

Here, we perform a study of the density of the rapidly\nupflowing material and compare it to that of the line core which corresponds to\nthe bulk of the plasma. For this task we use spectroscopic observations of\nseveral active regions taken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer of\nthe Hinode mission. The density sensitive ratio of the Fe XIV lines at 264.78\nand 274.20 A is used to determine wing and core densities.

Abstract: Using idealized 1-D Eulerian hydrodynamic simulations, we contrast the\nbehavior of isolated supernovae with the superbubbles driven by multiple,\ncollocated supernovae. Continuous energy injection via successive supernovae\ngoing off within the hot/dilute bubble maintains a strong termination shock.\nThis strong shock keeps the superbubble over-pressured and drives the outer\nshock well after it becomes radiative. Isolated supernovae, in contrast, with\nno further energy injection, become radiative quite early ($\\lesssim 0.1$ Myr,\n10s of pc), and stall at scales $\\lesssim 100$ pc. We show that isolated\nsupernovae lose almost all of their mechanical energy by a Myr, but\nsuperbubbles can retain up to $\\sim 40\\%$ of the input energy in form of\nmechanical energy over the lifetime of the star cluster (few 10s of Myr).

Results\n  from scaling the ISM opacity Abstract: The opacity due to grains in the envelope of a protoplanet regulates the\naccretion rate of gas during formation, thus the final bulk composition of\nplanets with primordial H/He is a function of it. Observationally, for\nexoplanets with known mass and radius it is possible to estimate the bulk\ncomposition via internal structure models. We first determine the reduction\nfactor of the ISM grain opacity f_opa that leads to gas accretion rates\nconsistent with grain evolution models. We then compare the bulk composition of\nsynthetic low-mass and giant planets at different f_opa with observations. For\nf_opa=1 (full ISM opacity) the synthetic low-mass planets have too small radii,\ni.e., too low envelope masses compared to observations. At f_opa=0.003, the\nvalue calibrated with the grain evolution models, synthetic and actual planets\noccupy similar mass-radius loci. The mean enrichment of giant planets relative\nto the host star as a function of planet mass M can be approximated as\nZ_p/Z_star = beta*(M/M_Jup)^alpha. We find alpha=-0.7 independent of f_opa in\nsynthetic populations in agreement with the observational result (-0.71+-0.10).\nThe absolute enrichment level decreases from beta=8.5 at f_opa=1 to 3.5 at\nf_opa=0. At f_opa=0.003 one finds beta=7.2 which is similar to the\nobservational result (6.3+-1.0). We thus find observational hints that the\nopacity in protoplanetary atmospheres is much smaller than in the ISM even if\nthe specific value of the grain opacity cannot be constrained here. The result\nfor the enrichment of giant planets helps to distinguish core accretion and\ngravitational instability. In the simplest picture of core accretion where\nfirst a critical core forms and afterwards only gas is added, alpha=-1. If a\ncore accretes all planetesimals inside the feeding zone, alpha=-2/3.

In this study we use deep optical and near-infrared observations of\nthe underlying hosts of BCDs in order to study the structural differences\nbetween different types of dwarf galaxies. When compared with dwarf irregular\ngalaxies of similar luminosities, we find that the underlying hosts of BCDs\nhave significantly more concentrated light distributions, with smaller scale\nlengths and brighter central surface brightnesses. We demonstrate here that the\nunderlying hosts of BCDs are distinct from the broad continuum of typical dwarf\nirregular galaxies, and that it is unlikely that most dwarf irregular galaxies\ncan transform into a BCD or vice versa. Furthermore, we find that the starburst\nin a BCD only brightens it on average by ~0.8 mag (factor of two), in agreement\nwith other studies. It appears that a BCD is a long-lived and distinct type of\ndwarf galaxy that exhibits an exceptionally concentrated matter distribution.\nWe suggest that it is this compact mass distribution that enables the strong\nstar formation events that characterize this class of dwarf galaxy, that the\ncompactness of the underlying host can be used as a distinguishing parameter\nbetween BCDs and other dwarf galaxies, and that it can also be used to identify\nBCDs which are not currently experiencing an intense starburst event. \n\n"}

Focusing on z = 1 and 2 we propose a method of environmental\ncalibration which can be applied to the next generation of low to medium\nresolution spectroscopic surveys. Using an up-to-date semi-analytic model of\ngalaxy formation, we measure the local density of galaxies in fixed apertures\non different scales. There is a clear correlation of density with halo mass for\nsatellite galaxies, while a significant population of low mass centrals is\nfound at high densities in the neighbourhood of massive haloes. In this case\nthe density simply traces the mass of the most massive halo within the\naperture. To identify central and satellite galaxies, we apply an\nobservationally motivated stellar mass rank method which is both highly pure\nand complete, especially in the more massive haloes where such a division is\nmost meaningful. Finally we examine a test case for the recovery of\nenvironmental trends: the passive fraction of galaxies and its dependence on\nstellar and halo mass for centrals and satellites. With careful calibration,\nobservationally defined quantities do a good job of recovering known trends in\nthe model. This result stands even with reduced redshift accuracy, provided the\nsample is deep enough to preserve a wide dynamic range of density. \n\n"}

We find from our magnetograms that the\ndistributions of the vertical [B_v] and the horizontal [B_h] component of the\nmagnetic field over the area of the magnetic subregion are spatially well\ncorrelated; in contrast, the rise of a flux-tube loop would result in a\nqualitatively different pattern, with the maxima of the two magnetic-field\ncomponents spatially separated: the vertical field would be the strongest where\neither spot emerges, while the maximum horizontal-field strengths would be\nreached in between them. A specific feature, which we call the bordering\neffect, is revealed: some local extrema of B_v are bordered with areas of\nlocally enhanced B_h. This effect suggests a fountainlike spatial structure of\nthe magnetic field near the B_v extrema, which is also hardly compatible with\nthe emergence of a flux-tube loop.

CP stars exhibiting this phenomenon are normally\nclassified as alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variables. It is important to\nincrease the sample of known rotational periods among CP stars by discovering\nnew ACV variables. The ASAS-3 data were cross-correlated with the Catalogue of\nAp, HgMn, and Am stars in order to analyse the light curves of bona fide CP and\nrelated stars. The light curves were downloaded and cleaned of outliers and\ndata points with a flag indicating bad quality. Promising candidates showing a\nlarger scatter than observed for constant stars in the corresponding magnitude\nrange were searched for periodic signals using a standard Fourier technique. In\ntotal, we found 323 variables, from which 246 are reported here for the first\ntime, and 77 were probably wrongly classified before. The observed variability\npattern of most stars is in accordance with an ACV classification.

Within this\nscheme, the angular parameter which defines quasi-elliptical isophotes is\ntransformed from the commonly used, but inappropriate, polar co-ordinate to the\n`eccentric anomaly'. This provides a superior description of deviations from\nellipticity, better capturing the true isophotal shape. Furthermore, this makes\nit possible to accurately recover both the surface brightness profile, using\nthe correct azimuthally-averaged isophote, and the two-dimensional model of any\ngalaxy: the hitherto ubiquitous, but artificial, cross-like features in\nresidual images are completely removed. The formalism has been implemented into\nthe IRAF tasks $Ellipse$ and $Bmodel$ to create the new tasks `$Isofit$', and\n`$Cmodel$'.

A\nwell-characterized stellar sample suggests at least two different relationships\nbetween rotation period and cycle period, with some stars exhibiting long and\nshort cycles simultaneously. Within this sample, the solar cycle periods are\ntypical of a more rapidly rotating star, implying that the Sun might be in a\ntransitional state or that it has an unusual evolutionary history. In this\nwork, we present new and archival observations of dual magnetic cycles in the\nyoung solar analog HD 30495, an $\\sim$1 Gyr-old G1.5V star with a rotation\nperiod near 11 days.

The lags\nare based on the 2014 spectroscopic light curves alone (32 epochs over 6\nmonths) and focus on the Hbeta and MgII broad lines in the 100 lowest-redshift\n(z<0.8) quasars included in SDSS-RM; they represent a small subset of the lags\nthat SDSS-RM (including 849 quasars to z~4.5) is expected to deliver. The\nreported preliminary lag measurements are for intermediate-luminosity quasars\nat 0.3<~z<0.8, including 9 Hbeta lags and 6 MgII lags, for the first time\nextending RM results to this redshift-luminosity regime and providing direct\nquasar black hole mass estimates over ~ half of cosmic time. The MgII lags also\nincrease the number of known MgII lags by several-fold, and start to explore\nthe utility of MgII for RM at high redshift. The location of these new lags at\nhigher redshifts on the observed BLR size-luminosity relationship is\nstatistically consistent with previous Hbeta results at z<0.3.

We present an\nindirect method to detect the presence of a hot bubble using hydrostatic\nphotoionization calculations of the cold (~10^4 K) line-emitting gas.

A coaddition image that is optimal for any\n  purpose in the background dominated noise limit Abstract: Image coaddition is one of the most basic operations that astronomers\nperform. In Paper~I, we presented the optimal ways to coadd images in order to\ndetect faint sources and to perfrom flux measurements under the assumption that\nthe noise is approximately Gaussian. Here, we build on these results and derive\nfrom first principles a coaddition technique which is optimal for any\nhypothesis testing and measurement (e.g., source detection, flux or shape\nmeasurements and star/galaxy separation), in the background-noise-dominated\ncase. This method has several important properties. The pixels of the resulting\ncoadd image are uncorrelated. This image preserves all the information (from\nthe original individual images) on all spatial frequencies. Any hypothesis\ntesting or measurement that can be done on all the individual images\nsimultaneously, can be done on the coadded image without any loss of\ninformation. The PSF of this image is typically as narrow, or narrower than the\nPSF of the best image in the ensemble. Moreover, this image is practically\nindistinguishable from a regular single image, meaning that any code that\nmeasures any property on a regular astronomical image can be applied to it\nunchanged. In particular, the optimal source detection statistic derived in\npaper~I is reproduced by matched filtering this image with its own PSF. This\ncoaddition process, which we call proper coaddition, can be understood as a the\nmaximum signal-to-noise ratio measurement of the Fourier transform of the\nimage, weighted in such a way that the noise in the entire Fourier domain is of\nequal variance. This method has important implications for multi-epoch\nseeing-limited deep surveys, weak lensing galaxy shape measurements, and\ndiffraction-limited imaging via speckle observations. The last topic will be\ncovered in depth in future papers. We provide an implementation of this\nalgorithm in MATLAB. \n\n"}

If close-in giant planets on eccentric orbits are efficient at\nscattering rocky planetary material into their host stars, then HD80606 should\nshow evidence of having accreted rocky material while HD80607 should not. Here\nwe show that the trends of abundance versus element condensation temperature\nfor HD80606 and HD80607 are statistically indistinguishable, corroborating the\nrecent result of Saffe et al.

Quite a few pNGB models with different potentials\nsuch as the QCD axion and the dilaton lead to attractive self-interactions. Yet\nif an axion is a remnant of a 5D gauged U(1) symmetry, its self-interactions\ncould be repulsive provided the masses and charges of the 5D matter\ncontributing to its potential satisfy certain constraints.

To correct the\nsystematic difference between DR7 and DR9 due to the different instrumental\nsetup, we produced a correction spectrum by using a sample of F-stars observed\nboth in DR7 and DR9.

We suggest that advanced civilizations could cloak their\npresence, or deliberately broadcast it, through controlled laser emission. Such\nemission could distort the apparent shape of their transit light curves with\nrelatively little energy, due to the collimated beam and relatively infrequent\nnature of transits. We estimate that humanity could cloak the Earth from\nKepler-like broadband surveys using an optical monochromatic laser array\nemitting a peak power of about 30 MW for roughly 10 hours per year. A chromatic\ncloak, effective at all wavelengths, is more challenging requiring a large\narray of tunable lasers with a total power of approximately 250 MW.\nAlternatively, a civilization could cloak only the atmospheric signatures\nassociated with biological activity on their world, such as oxygen, which is\nachievable with a peak laser power of just around 160 kW per transit. Finally,\nwe suggest that the time of transit for optical SETI is analogous to the\nwater-hole in radio SETI, providing a clear window in which observers may\nexpect to communicate.

Furthermore, we find that amongst the barred S0s, there is a\ntrend for the longer and massive bars to be associated with comparatively\nbigger and massive classical bulges -- possibly suggesting bar growth being\nfacilitated by these classical bulges. In addition, we find that the bulge\neffective radius is always less than the bar effective radius --indicating an\ninteresting synergy between the host classical bulge and bars being maintained\nwhile bar growth occurred in these S0s. \n\n"}

Physical properties derived from spectral energy\n  distributions Abstract: We characterise the physical nature of a 1.1 mm-selected, flux-limited, and\ninterferometrically followed up sample of SMGs in COSMOS. We used the MAGPHYS\ncode to fit the multiwavelength (UV-radio) SEDs of 16 of the target SMGs. We\nalso constructed the pure radio SEDs of our SMGs using three different radio\nbands (325 MHz, 1.4 GHz, and 3 GHz). Moreover, since two SMGs in our sample,\nAzTEC1 and AzTEC3, benefit from previous CO line observations, we studied their\nproperties in more detail. We found that 63% of our target SMGs lie above the\ngalaxy main-sequence by more than a factor of 3, and hence are starbursts. The\n3 GHz radio sizes we have previously measured for the target SMGs were compared\nwith the present stellar mass estimates, and we found that the z>3 SMGs are\nfairly consistent with the mass-size relationship of z~2 compact, quiescent\ngalaxies (cQGs). The median IR-radio correlation parameter is found to be\nq=2.27, which is lower than measured locally (median q=2.64). AzTEC1 is found\nto have a sub-Eddington SFR surface density (by a factor of 2.6), while AzTEC3\nappears to be an Eddington-limited starburster. The gas reservoir in these two\nhigh-z SMGs would be exhausted in only ~86 and 19 Myr at the current SFR,\nrespectively. A comparison of the MAGPHYS-based properties of our SMGs with\nthose of equally bright ALESS SMGs suggests that the two populations share\nfairly similar physical characteristics, including the q parameter. A hint of\nnegative correlation is found between the 3 GHz size and the level of\nstarburstiness, and hence cosmic-ray electrons in more compact starbursts might\nbe more susceptible to free-free absorption. Some of the derived low and high q\nvalues (compared to the local median) could be the result of a specific\nmerger/post-starburst phase of galaxy evolution. Overall, our results support\nthe scenario where z>3 SMGs evolve into today's giant ellipticals. \n\n"}

This scenario typically requires a large \"boost factor\" to be\nconsistent with a thermal relic dark matter candidate produced via freeze-out.\nHowever, such an explanation is disfavored by constraints from CMB observations\non energy deposition during the epoch of recombination. We discuss a scenario\ncalled late-decaying two-component dark matter (LD2DM), where the entire DM\nconsists of two semi-degenerate species. Within this framework, the heavier\nspecies is produced as a thermal relic in the early universe and decays to the\nlighter species over cosmological timescales. Consequently, the lighter species\nbecomes the DM which populates the universe today. We show that annihilation of\nthe lighter DM species with an enhanced cross-section, produced via such a\nnon-thermal mechanism, can explain the observed AMS-02 positron flux while\navoiding CMB constraints. The observed DM relic density can be correctly\nreproduced as well with simple s-wave annihilation cross-sections. We\ndemonstrate that the scenario is safe from CMB constraints on late-time energy\ndepositions during the cosmic \"dark ages\". Interestingly, structure formation\nconstraints force us to consider small mass splittings between the two dark\nmatter species.

In this paper, we focus on the subset of WIMP models in which the\ndark matter annihilates in the early universe through couplings to either the\nStandard Model $Z$ or the Standard Model Higgs boson.

In the case of $Z$ mediated dark\nmatter, the only scenarios that are not currently excluded are those in which\nthe dark matter is a fermion with an axial coupling and with a mass either\nwithin a few GeV of the $Z$ resonance ($m_{\\rm DM} \\simeq m_Z/2$) or greater\nthan 200 GeV, or with a vector coupling and with $m_{\\rm DM} > 6$ TeV.

Aims: Attempt to,\nfor the first time, spectrally resolve CO thermal line emission in a small\nsample of AGB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Methods: ALMA was used to\nobserve 2 OH/IR stars and 4 carbon stars in the LMC in the CO J= 2-1 line.\nResults: We present the first measurement of expansion velocities in\nextragalactic carbon stars. All four C-stars are detected and wind expansion\nvelocities and stellar velocities are directly measured. Mass-loss rates are\nderived from modelling the spectral energy distribution and Spitzer/IRS\nspectrum with the DUSTY code. Gas-to-dust ratios are derived that make the\npredicted velocities agree with the observed ones. The expansion velocities and\nMLRs are compared to a Galactic sample of well-studied relatively low MLRs\nstars supplemented with \"extreme\" C-stars that have properties more similar to\nthe LMC targets. Gas MLRs derived from a simple formula are significantly\nsmaller than derived from the dust modelling, indicating an order of magnitude\nunderestimate of the estimated CO abundance, time-variable mass loss, or that\nthe CO intensities in LMC stars are lower than predicted by the formula derived\nfor Galactic objects.

Conclusions: Although the LMC sample is small and\nthe comparison to Galactic stars is non-trivial because of uncertainties in\ntheir distances it appears that for C stars the wind expansion velocities in\nthe LMC are lower than in the solar neighbourhood, while the MLRs appear\nsimilar.

In total, this survey has resulted in the discovery of\n17 new gamma-ray pulsars, of which 13 are newly reported in this work, and an\naccompanying paper. These pulsars are all young, isolated pulsars with\ncharacteristic ages between 12 kyr and 2 Myr, and spin-down powers between\n$10^{34}$ and $4\\times10^{36}$ erg/s.

We focus\non large scales where cosmic density fields are quasi-linear. On these scales,\nthe clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative bias expansion,\nand the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of\ncoefficients of the expansion, called bias parameters. The review begins with a\ndetailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the\nrigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions\nof General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key\ncomponents of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational\nobservables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their\ntime derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all\nthese contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the\npeak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical\nmeaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection\nbetween bias parameters and galaxy statistics. We then review the excursion-set\nformalism and peak theory which provide predictions for the values of the bias\nparameters.

Higgsplosion, the\nfirst mechanism, occurs at some critical energy in the 25 to 10^3 TeV range,\nand leads to an exponentially growing decay rate of highly energetic particles\ninto multiple Higgs bosons. We argue that this a well-controlled\nnon-perturbative phenomenon in the Higgs-sector which involves the final state\nHiggs multiplicities n in the regime n \\lambda >> 1 where \\lambda is the Higgs\nself-coupling. If this mechanism is realised in nature, the cross-sections for\nproducing ultra-high multiplicities of Higgs bosons are likely to become\nobservable and even dominant in this energy range. At the same time, however,\nthe apparent exponential growth of these cross-sections at even higher energies\nwill be tamed and automatically cut-off by a related Higgspersion mechanism. As\na result, and in contrast to previous studies, multi-Higgs production does not\nviolate perturbative unitarity. Building on this approach, we then argue that\nthe effects of Higgsplosion alter quantum corrections from very heavy states to\nthe Higgs boson mass. Above a certain energy, which is much smaller than their\nmasses, these states would rapidly decay into multiple Higgs bosons. The heavy\nstates become unrealised as they decay much faster than they are formed. The\nloop integrals contributing to the Higgs mass will be cut off not by the masses\nof the heavy states, but by the characteristic loop momenta where their decay\nwidths become comparable to their masses. Hence, the cut-off scale would be\nmany orders of magnitude lower than the heavy mass scales themselves, thus\nsuppressing their quantum corrections to the Higgs boson mass. \n\n"}

In one such\ntest that is currently employed for LIGO black-hole binary mergers, generic\ndeviations from relativity are represented by $N$ deformation parameters in a\ngeneralised waveform model; the Bayesian evidence for each of its $2^N$\ncombinatorial submodels is then combined into a posterior odds ratio for\nmodified gravity over relativity in a null-hypothesis test.

Here, we present the chemical\nmodeling of glycine in hot cores using the state-of-the-art three-phase\nchemical model NAUTILUS, which is focused on the latest glycine chemistry. For\nthe formation process of glycine on the grain surface, we obtained consistent\nresults with previous studies that glycine would be formed via the reactions of\nCOOH with CH$_2$NH$_2$. However, we will report three important findings\nregarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine.\nFirst, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature\nprogrammed thermal desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine\nwas destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH$_3$O radicals\nbefore it fully evaporates. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase\nis more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case,\nNH$_2$OH and CH$_3$COOH rather than CH$_3$NH$_2$ and CH$_2$NH would be the\nessential precursors to the gas phase glycine. Secondly, since the gas phase\nglycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, early\nevolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the\nfuture glycine surveys. Thirdly, we suggest the possibility that the\nsuprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH\nradicals from CO$_2$, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of\nglycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in\ndetail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future. \n\n"}

Machine learning is a promising solution, allowing the development\nof algorithms tailored to specific telescope arrays and science cases. We\npresent DeepSource - a deep learning solution - that uses convolutional neural\nnetworks to achieve these goals. DeepSource enhances the Signal-to-Noise Ratio\n(SNR) of the original map and then uses dynamic blob detection to detect\nsources. Trained and tested on two sets of 500 simulated 1 deg x 1 deg MeerKAT\nimages with a total of 300,000 sources, DeepSource is essentially perfect in\nboth purity and completeness down to SNR = 4 and outperforms PyBDSF in all\nmetrics. For uniformly-weighted images it achieves a Purity x Completeness (PC)\nscore at SNR = 3 of 0.73, compared to 0.31 for the best PyBDSF model. For\nnatural-weighting we find a smaller improvement of ~40% in the PC score at SNR\n= 3. If instead we ask where either of the purity or completeness first drop to\n90%, we find that DeepSource reaches this value at SNR = 3.6 compared to the\n4.3 of PyBDSF (natural-weighting). A key advantage of DeepSource is that it can\nlearn to optimally trade off purity and completeness for any science case under\nconsideration.

For a reasonable choice of parameters, thermal inflation\nmodels naturally predict a suppression of the matter power spectrum on galactic\nand sub-galactic scales, mimicking the effect of warm or interacting dark\nmatter. Matter power spectra in these models are also characterised by an\nexcess of power (w.r.t. the standard $\\Lambda$CDM power spectrum) just below\nthe suppression scale. By running a suite of N-body simulations we investigate\nthe non-linear growth of structure in models of thermal inflation. We measure\nthe non-linear matter power spectrum and extract halo statistics, such as the\nhalo mass function, and compare these quantities with those predicted in the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model and in other models with damped matter\nfluctuations. We find that the thermal inflation models considered here produce\nmeasurable differences in the matter power spectrum from $\\Lambda$CDM at\nredshifts $z>5$, while the halo mass functions are appreciably different at all\nredshifts. The halo mass function at $z=0$ for thermal inflation displays an\nenhancement of around $\\sim 20\\%$ w.r.t. $\\Lambda$CDM and a damping at lower\nhalo masses, with the position of the enhancement depending on the value of the\nfree parameter in the model.

They are, however, promising candidates for\nthe progenitors of the heaviest binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected. If\nthese BBHs are the product of binary evolution, then PPISNe could occur in very\nclose binaries. Motivated by this, we discuss the implications of a PPISN\nhappening with a close binary companion, and what impact these events have on\nthe formation of merging BBHs through binary evolution. For this, we have\ncomputed a set of models of metal-poor ($Z_\\odot/10$) single helium stars using\nthe \\texttt{MESA} software instrument. For PPISN progenitors with pre-pulse\nmasses $>50M_\\odot$ we find that, after a pulse, heat deposited throughout the\nlayers of the star that remain bound cause it to expand to more than\n$100R_\\odot$ for periods of $10^2-10^4\\;$~yrs depending on the mass of the\nprogenitor. This results in long-lived phases of Roche-lobe overflow or even\ncommon-envelope events if there is a close binary companion, leading to\nadditional electromagnetic transients associated to PPISN eruptions.

Wavelet-based analyses have been\nable to unambiguously determine both the number of spiral arms and the rotation\nrate of many of these patterns. However, there are many more planetary normal\nmodes that should have resonances in the rings, implying that many normal modes\ndo not have sufficiently large amplitudes to generate obvious ring waves.\nFortunately, recent advances in wavelet analysis allow weaker wave signals to\nbe uncovered by combining data from multiple occultations. These new analytical\ntools reveal that a pattern previously identified as a single spiral wave\nactually consists of two superimposed waves, one with 5 spiral arms rotating at\n1593.6 degrees/day and one with 11 spiral arms rotating at 1450.5 degrees/day.\nFurthermore, a broad search for new waves revealed four previously unknown wave\npatterns with 6, 7, 8 and 9 spiral arms rotating around the planet at 1538.2\ndegrees/day, 1492.5 degrees/day, 1454.2 degrees/day and 1421.8 degrees/day,\nrespectively.

Drag forces and accretion rates dictate how these systems are\ntransformed by these interactions. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flows, in which a binary moves\nsupersonically relative to a homogeneous medium, using the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code FLASH. We simulate a range of values of the initial semi-major\naxis of the orbit relative to the gravitational focusing impact parameter of\nthe pair. When the binary separation is less than the gravitational focusing\nimpact parameter, the pair orbits within a shared bow shock. When the pair is\nwider, each object has an individual bow-shock structure. The long-term\nevolution of the binary is determined by the timescales for accretion, slowing\nof the center of mass, and orbital inspiral. We find a clear hierarchy of these\ntimescales; a binary's center-of-mass motion is slowed over a shorter timescale\nthan the pair inspirals or accretes. In contrast to previous analytic\npredictions, which assume an unperturbed background medium, we find that the\ntimescale for orbital inspiral is proportional to the semi-major axis to the\n$0.19 \\pm 0.01$ power.

In\nsuch a system, both disk and halo contribute significantly to the maximum\nrotation of the disk, and the interaction between the disk and halo components\nacts to reduce the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation.

In agreement with previous works on earlier catalogs, we find that\ngroups can be described as collapsing systems. Their sampled size is much\nlarger than their expected virialized region.

Neglecting cooling and heating terms, the\nstationnary energy conservation equation reduces to a 2nd order differential\nequation, whose resolution requires two boundary conditions, taken here as the\ninner radius and the ratio between inner and outer temperature. Once these two\nconstants are chosen, the TP has a fixed analytical expression, which\nreproduces nicely the observed ``universal'' TP obtained by Markevitch et al.\n(1998) from ASCA data. Using observed X-ray surface brightnesses for two hot\nclusters with spatially resolved TP, the local polytropic index and the hot gas\nfraction profile are predicted and compare very well with ASCA observations\n(Markevitch et al 1999). Moreover, the total density profile derived from\nobserved X-ray surface brightness, hydrostatic equilibrium and the\nconduction-driven TP is very well fit by three analytical profiles found to\ndescribe the structure of galactic or cluster halos in numerical simulations of\ncollisionless matter (Hernquist, 1991; Navarro et al. 1995, 1997; Burkert\n1995).

We find the Ne absorption lines in the High Energy Grating spectrum to be\nresolved with FWHM=840{+490}{-360} km/s. We have used regions in the spectrum\nwhere no lines are expected to determine the X-ray continuum, and we model the\nabsorption and emission lines using photoionized-plasma calculations. The model\nconsists of two absorption components which have an order of magnitude\ndifference in their ionization parameters. The two components are spherically\noutflowing from the AGN and thus contribute to both the absorption and the\nemission via P Cygni profiles.

If galaxies form according to the model of hierarchical\nclustering then there should be many small halos compared to the number of big\nhalos. If this theory is valid then there must be a mechanism that eliminates\nat least the visible component of galaxies in low density regions.

The rigorous solution shows that the\nextinction of the fractal clusters, with N < 50 and particle radii 10 nm,\ndisplays a peak within 2% of the location of the observed interstellar\nextinction peak at ~4.6 inverse micron; the smaller the cluster, the closer its\npeak gets to this value. By contrast, the peak in the extinction of the more\ncompact clusters lie more than 4% from 4.6 inverse micron.

The\nEddington ratios of radio galaxies are substantially smaller than those of\nquasars.

Our\nsample contains 68 pulse trains detected in a search of 159 bursts from 8\naccreting neutron stars. As a first step, we confirm that the oscillations\nusually drift upward in frequency by about 1% toward an apparent saturation\nfrequency. Previously noted anomalies, such as drifts toward lower frequencies\nas the oscillations disappear (``spin-down'' episodes) and instances of two\nsignals present simultaneously at frequencies separated by a few Hz, occur in\n5% of oscillations. Having verified the generally accepted description of burst\noscillations, we proceed to study the coherence of the oscillations during\nindividual bursts, and the dispersion in the asymptotic frequencies in bursts\nobserved over five years. On short time scales, we find that 30% of the\noscillation trains do not appear to evolve smoothly in phase. This suggests\neither that two signals are present simultaneously with a frequency difference\ntoo small to resolve (< 1 Hz), that the frequency evolution is discontinuous,\nor that discrete phase jumps occur. On time scales of years, the maximum\nfrequencies of the oscillations exhibit fractional dispersions of < 0.004. In\nthe case of 4U 1636-536, this dispersion is uncorrelated with the known orbital\nphase, which indicates that a mechanism besides orbital Doppler shifts prevents\nthe oscillations from appearing perfectly stable.

A comparison with recent observational data by Adelberger et. al\non the Ly-alpha forest around galaxies reveals that actual galaxies may have\nsystematically less Ly-alpha absorption within 1 Mpc of them than our simulated\ngalaxies.

A spectral deprojection analysis of data\nextracted from circular annuli reveals that a two-temperature model (2T) of the\nhot gas is favored over single-phase or cooling flow (M_dot = 4.5 +/- 0.2\nM_{sun}/yr) models within the central ~30 kpc. Alternatively, the data can be\nfit equally well if the temperature within each spherical shell varies\ncontinuously from ~T_h to T_c ~ T_h/2, but no lower. The high spatial\nresolution of the Chandra data allows us to determine that the temperature\nexcursion T_h --> T_c required in each shell exceeds the temperature range\nbetween the boundaries of the same shell in the best-fitting single-phase\nmodel. This is strong evidence for a multi-phase gas having a limited\ntemperature range. The cooler component of the 2T model has a temperature (T_c\n\\~ 0.7 keV) similar to the kinetic temperature of the stars. The hot phase has\na temperature (T_h ~ 1.4 keV) characteristic of the virial temperature of the\n\\~10^{13} M_{sun} halo expected in the NGC 5044 group. However, in view of the\nmorphological disturbances and X-ray holes visible in the Chandra image within\nR ~10 kpc, bubbles of gas heated to ~T_h in this region may be formed by\nintermittent AGN feedback. Some additional heating at larger radii may be\nassociated with the evolution of the cold front near R ~50 kpc, as suggested by\nthe sharp edge in the EPIC images. \n\n"}

We identify 12 cosmological systems, and 6 systems\nthat are either ejected from the background QSO or affected by its local\nradiation field. Almost all of the intergalactic OVI is associated with strong\nLy-a absorption (N_HI > 10^15.2 cm^-2), as well as absorption from CIV and\noften lower ionization species. The absorbing regions are conservatively\nconstrained to have L<=200 kpc and rho/rho_bar >= 2.5, with actual values\nprobably closer to L ~ 60 kpc and rho/rho_bar ~ 10-30. They also have two\ndistinct gas phases: one which produces photoionized CIV and SiIV at T ~ 30,000\nK, and a second which is seen only in OVI. The OVI temperature is difficult to\nconstrain due to uncertainty in the amount of nonthermal line broadening, but\nit does appear that this gas is hotter than the CIV/SiIV phase and could\nsupport collisional OVI production. The OVI is strongly clustered on velocity\nscales of dv=100-300 km/s, with weaker signal extending to dv = 750 km/s. The\npower-law slope of the correlation function resembles that of local galaxy and\ncluster surveys, with a comoving correlation length of 11h_{65}^-1 Mpc.

We discuss\ncertain questions related to the determination of the nature of dark energy\ncomponent from observations of high redshift supernova. The main results of our\nanalysis are: (i) Even if the precise value of w_X is known from observations,\nit is not possible to determine the nature of the unknown dark energy source\nusing only kinematical and geometrical measurements. We have given explicit\nexamples to show that different types of sources can give rise to a given w_X.\n(ii) Although the full data set of supernova observations (which are currently\navailable) strongly rule out models without dark energy, the high (z>0.25) and\nlow (z<0.25) redshift data sets, individually, admit decelerating models with\nzero dark energy. Any possible evolution in the absolute magnitude of the\nsupernovae, if detected, might allow the decelerating models to be consistent\nwith the data.

Using data spanning more than\ntwo complete orbits of the system, we detect evidence for tidally induced\nnon-radial oscillations on the surface of GP Vel, apparent as peaks in the\npower spectrum of the residuals to the radial velocity curve fit. By removing\nthe effect of these oscillations (to first order) and binning the radial\nvelocities, we have determined the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve\nof GP Vel to be K_o=22.6+/-1.5 km/s. Given the accurately measured\nsemi-amplitude of the pulsar's orbit, the mass ratio of the system is\n0.081+/-0.005. We are able to set upper and lower limits on the masses of the\ncomponent stars as follows. Assuming GP Vel fills its Roche lobe then the\ninclination angle of the system, i=70.1+/-2.6 deg. In this case we obtain the\nmasses of the two stars as M_x=2.27 +/-0.17 M_sun for the neutron star and\nM_o=27.9+/-1.3 M_sun for GP Vel.

These new high-resolution data show that the ~1000 km/s\nbroad HI absorption, earlier detected in low-resolution WSRT observations, is\noccurring against the bright, eastern radio lobe, about 1.6 kpc from the\nnucleus. We use new optical spectra taken with the WHT to make a detailed\ncomparison of the kinematics of the neutral hydrogen with that of the ionised\ngas. The striking similarity between the complex kinematics of the two gas\nphases suggests that both the ionised gas and the neutral gas are part of the\nsame outflow. Earlier studies of the ionised gas had already found evidence for\na strong interaction between the radio jet and the interstellar medium at the\nlocation of the eastern radio lobe. Our results show that the fast outflow\nproduced by this interaction also contains a component of neutral atomic\nhydrogen. The most likely interpretation is that the radio jet ionises the ISM\nand accelerates it to the high outflow velocities observed.

The\nmass outflow rate measured in 3C~305 is comparable, although at the lower end\nof the distribution, to that found in Ultra-Luminous IR galaxies.

For the\nfirst two models, a uniform circumburst medium provides a better fit to the\noptical light-curve break than a wind-like medium with a r^{-2} stratification.\nHowever, in the only two cases where the energy injection model may be at work,\na wind medium is favoured (an energy injection is also possible in a third\ncase, the afterglow 970508, whose optical emission exhibited a sharp rise but\nnot a steepening decay).

This is in contrast to the bright optical flashes previously\ndiscovered in some GRBs (e.g. GRB 990123 and GRB 021211). Comparisons of the\nX-ray afterglow flux to the optical afterglow flux and prompt gamma-ray fluence\nis used to quantify the seemingly deficient optical, and in some cases X-ray,\nlight at these early epochs.

The density profiles of the simulated clusters\nclosely follow the NFW form, but we find that the recovered values of the inner\nslope are systematically underestimated, by about 0.4 in the mean, if the lens\nis assumed to be axially symmetric. However, if the ellipticity and orientation\nof the iso-contours of the cluster lensing potential are taken into account,\nthen the inner slopes can be recovered quite accurately for a significant\nsubset of the clusters whose central surface density profiles appear the most\nregular. These have lensing potentials with ellipticities in the range\n0.15-0.4. Further simulations projecting one cluster along many random\nlines-of-sight show that, even for lower ellipticities, the central slopes are\nunderestimated by $\\sim 10-35%$. These simulations closely mimic past\nobservations (see e.g. Sand et al., 2004), suggesting that existing estimates\nof the central slopes may be biased towards low values. For the remaining\nclusters, where the lensing potential is strongly perturbed by active merging\nor by substructure, the correct determination of the inner slope requires a\nmore accurate model for the lens.

The X-ray segment of the SED is based on\nobservations with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, which are reported here for\nthe first time. The inner part of the flow is modeled as a radiatively\ninefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and the outer part as a standard thin disk.\nThe value of the transition radius (~225 Schwarzschild radii) between the RIAF\nand outer thin disk was obtained from our previous fitting of the double-peaked\nBalmer emission line profile, which originates in the thin disk.

The angular momentum transport, disk morphology and radial\nprofiles depend sensitively on force and mass resolution. At low resolution,\nsimilar to that used in most current cosmological simulations, the cold gas\ncomponent has lost half of its initial angular momentum via different\nmechanisms. The angular momentum is transferred primarily to the hot halo\ncomponent, by resolution-dependent hydrodynamical and gravitational torques,\nthe latter arising from asymmetries in the mass distribution. In addition,\ndisk-particles can lose angular momentum while they are still in the hot phase\nby artificial viscosity. In the central disk, particles can transfer away over\n99% of their initial angular momentum due to spiral structure and/or the\npresence of a central bar. The strength of this transport also depends on force\nand mass resolution - large softening will suppress the bar instability, low\nmass resolution enhances the spiral structure.

Abstract: In this paper, we address whether the growth of supermassive black-holes has\nkept pace with the process of galaxy assembly. For this purpose, we first\nsearched the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) for \"tadpole galaxies\", which have\na knot at one end and an extended tail. They appear dynamically unrelaxed --\npresumably early-stage mergers -- and make up ~6% of the field galaxy\npopulation. Their redshift distribution follows that of field galaxies,\nindicating that -- if tadpole galaxies are indeed dynamically young -- the\nprocess of galaxy assembly generally kept up with the reservoir of field\ngalaxies as a function of epoch. Next, we present a search for HUDF objects\nwith point-source components that are optically variable (at the >~3.0 sigma\nlevel) on timescales of weeks--months. Among 4644 objects to i_AB=28.0 mag (10\nsigma), 45 have variable point-like components, which are likely weak AGN.\nAbout 1% of all field objects show variability for 0.1 < z < 4.5, and their\nredshift distribution is similar to that of field galaxies. Hence supermassive\nblack-hole growth in weak AGN likely also kept up with the process of galaxy\nassembly. However, the faint AGN sample has almost no overlap with the tadpole\nsample, which was predicted by recent hydrodynamical numerical simulations.\nThis suggests that tadpole galaxies are early-stage mergers, which likely\npreceded the ``turn-on'' of the AGN component and the onset of visible\npoint-source variability by >~1 Gyr. \n\n"}

Since the submm emission presents an unusually large angular\nextent (~1 arcmin), the possible radio emission asociatted with that system can\nhelp to identify optical/NIR counterparts due to the higher spatial resolution\nand astrometric accuracy of the radio observations. Archive VLA data (BnA\nconfiguration at 1.4 GHz) was reduced and analysed. A simple lens model was\nconstructed to aid the interpretation of the radio and pre-existing sub-mm and\noptical/NIR data. We present a 1.4 GHz map of the central region of\nMS0451.6-0305 and report the detection of gravitationally lensed radio\nemission, coincident with the previously discovered sub-mm lensed emission.

The data are compared to two\ntheoretical optical depth distributions: a model distribution based on the\ndensity distribution of Miralda-Escude et al. (2000) (MHR00), and a lognormal\ndistribution. We assume a uniform UV background and an isothermal IGM for the\nMHR00 model, as has been done in previous works. Under these assumptions, the\nMHR00 model produces poor fits to the observed flux PDFs at redshifts where the\noptical depth distribution is well sampled, unless large continuum corrections\nare applied. However, the lognormal optical depth distribution fits the data at\nall redshifts with only minor continuum adjustments.

We separate\nbrightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) from our main sample and reanalyze their\nphotometry due to a problem with the default pipeline sky subtraction for BCGs.\nThe observables we consider are effective radius (R_e), velocity dispersion\n(sigma), dynamical mass (M_dyn ~ R_e sigma2), effective density (sigma2/R_e2),\nand effective surface brightness (mu_e). With the exception of the L-M_dyn\ncorrelation, we find evidence of variations in the slope (i.e. the power-law\nindex) of the fundamental plane projections with luminosity for our normal\nelliptical galaxy population. In particular, the radius-luminosity and\nFaber-Jackson relations are steeper at high luminosity relative to low\nluminosity, and the more luminous ellipticals become progressively less dense\nand have lower surface brightnesses than lower luminosity ellipticals. These\nvariations can be understood as arising from differing formation histories,\nwith more luminous galaxies having less dissipation. Data from the literature\nand our reanalysis of BCGs show that BCGs have radius-luminosity and\nFaber-Jackson relations steeper than the brightest non-BCG ellipticals in our\nsample, consistent with significant growth of BCGs via dissipationless mergers.\nThe variations in slope we find in the Faber-Jackson relation of non-BCGs are\nqualitatively similar to that reported in the black hole mass-velocity\ndispersion (M_BH-sigma) correlation.

Like water circling a drain, inflowing mass must lose angular\nmomentum, presumably by vigorous turbulence in disks, which are essentially\ninviscid. The origin of the turbulence is unclear. Hot disks of electrically\nconducting plasma can become turbulent by way of the linear magnetorotational\ninstability. Cool disks, such as the planet-forming disks of protostars, may be\ntoo poorly ionized for the magnetorotational instability to occur, hence\nessentially unmagnetized and linearly stable. Nonlinear hydrodynamic\ninstability often occurs in linearly stable flows (for example, pipe flows) at\nsufficiently large Reynolds numbers. Although planet-forming disks have extreme\nReynolds numbers, Keplerian rotation enhances their linear hydrodynamic\nstability, so the question of whether they can be turbulent and thereby\ntransport angular momentum effectively is controversial.

Scaled to accretion\ndisks, rates of angular momentum transport lie far below astrophysical\nrequirements.

Complementing the model with a simple, physically\nplausible, recipe for the evolution of dust attenuation in metal poor galaxies\nwe reproduce the luminosity functions (LFs) of LBGs and of LAEs at different\nredshifts. This recipe yields a much faster increase with galactic age of\nattenuation in more massive galaxies, endowed with higher star formation rates.\nThese objects have therefore shorter lifetimes in the LAE and LBG phases, and\nare more easily detected in the dusty submillimeter bright phase. The short UV\nbright lifetimes of massive objects strongly mitigate the effect of the fast\nincrease of the massive halo density with decreasing redshift, thus accounting\nfor the weaker evolution of the LBG LF, compared to that of the halo mass\nfunction, and the even weaker evolution between z~6 and z~3 of the LAE LF.

The aim of this paper is to use the\nobserved motions of galaxies to map out variations in the Universe's expansion,\nand more importantly, to investigate whether real variations in the Hubble\nexpansion are detectable given the observational uncertainties. All-sky maps of\nthe observed variation in the expansion are produced using measurements\nobtained along specific lines-of-sight and smearing them across the sky using a\nGaussian profile. A map is produced for the final results of the HST\nExtragalactic Distance Scale Key Project for the Hubble constant, a comparison\nmap is produced from a set of essentially independent data, and Monte Carlo\ntechniques are used to analyse the statistical significance of the variation in\nthe maps.

The galaxy distribution depends sensitively on the efficiency with\nwhich galaxies form in halos of different mass. In small mass halos, galaxy\nformation is inhibited by the reheating of cooled gas by feedback processes,\nwhereas in large mass halos, it is inhibited by the long cooling time of the\ngas. As a result, the mass-to-light ratio of halos has a deep minimum at the\nhalo mass associated with L* galaxies. This leads to a scale dependent bias in\nthe distribution of galaxies relative to the distribution of mass. On large\nscales, the bias in the galaxy distribution is related in a simple way to the\nbias in the distribution of massive halos. On small scales, the correlation\nfunction is determined by the interplay between various effects including the\nspatial exclusion of dark matter halos, the distribution function of the number\nof galaxies occupying a single dark matter halo and, to a lesser extent,\ndynamical friction. Remarkably, these processes conspire to produce a\ncorrelation function in a flat, Omega_0=0.3, CDM model that is close to a\npower-law over nearly four orders of magnitude in amplitude. This model agrees\nwell with the correlation function of galaxies measured in the APM survey.

The basic assumption is\nthat a weak dynamo amplifies magnetic fields in AGB stars, such that magnetic\ncool spots are formed, mainly near the equatorial plane. Enhanced dust\nformation above these cool spots leads to a higher mass loss rate in the\nequatorial plane, resulting in the formation of an elliptical PN. The dust\nformation above cool spots becomes much more efficient when mass loss rate is\nhigh. In addition to explaining the correlation, the model has the advantage\nthat it can operate for very slowly rotating AGB stars, having rotation\nvelocities of less than $10^{-4}$ times the break-up velocity.

Our high-luminosity subsample selects galaxies\nhaving k-corrected and evolution-compensated R luminosities, M_R^{k,e}, above\n-20 mag (H_0=100 km/s/Mpc) where M_ast^{k,e}(R)simeq -20.3 mag.

The resulting sample is ideally suited for an analysis\nof the internal velocity and mass distribution of clusters. Previous analyses\nof this dataset used the Jeans equation to model the projected velocity\ndispersion profile. However, the results of such an analysis always yield a\nstrong degeneracy between the mass density profile and the velocity dispersion\nanisotropy profile. Here we analyze the full (R,v) dataset of galaxy positions\nand velocities in an attempt to break this degeneracy. We build an `ensemble\ncluster' from the individual clusters under the assumption that they form a\nhomologous sequence. To interpret the data we study a one-parameter family of\nspherical models with different constant velocity dispersion anisotropy. The\nbest-fit model is sought using a variety of statistics, including the overall\nlikelihood of the dataset. Although the results of our analysis depend slightly\non which statistic is used to judge the models, all statistics agree that the\nbest-fit model is close to isotropic. This result derives primarily from the\nfact that the observed grand-total velocity histogram is close to Gaussian,\nwhich is not expected to be the case for a strongly anisotropic model. The\nbest-fitting models have a mass-to-number-density ratio that is approximately\nindependent of radius over the range constrained by the data. They also have a\nmass-density profile that is consistent with the dark matter halo profile\nadvocated by Navarro, Frenk & White, in terms of both the profile shape and the\ncharacteristic scale length.

We argue that in\nsome regimes, stretching will be the only relevant process governing the\nevolution. In this case, the string two-point function is determined up to\nnormalization: the fractal dimension approaches one at short distance, but the\nrate of approach is characterized by an exponent that plays an essential role\nin network properties. The smoothness at short distance implies, for example,\nthat cosmic string lensing images are little distorted. We then add in loop\nproduction as a perturbation and find that it diverges at small scales. This\nneed not invalidate the stretching model, since the loop production occurs in\nlocalized regions, but it implies a complicated fragmentation process. Our\nability to model this process is limited, but we argue that loop production\npeaks a few orders of magnitude below the horizon scale, without the inclusion\nof gravitational radiation.

Of particular\ninterest is the case when the cross-coupling between the inflaton and the\nsecond scalar field is negative, which is naturally allowed in many realistic\nmodels. While the inflaton decays via parametric resonance in the positive\ncoupling case we find that for negative coupling there is a new mechanism of\nparticle production which we call negative coupling instability. Due to this\nnew mechanism the variances of the fields grow significantly larger before the\nproduction is shut off by the backreaction of the created particles. We also\nfind that heavy particles are produced much more efficiently with negative\ncoupling, which is of prime importance for GUT baryogenesis. Using a simple toy\nmodel for baryogenesis and the results of our lattice simulations we show that\nfor natural values of the cross-coupling enough 10^{14}GeV bosons are created\nto produce a baryon to entropy ratio consistent with observation.
