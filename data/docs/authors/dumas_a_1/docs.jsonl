Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach.

The excitation of electric currents in strings\noccurs mostly in clusters of galaxies, which are characterized by magnetic\nfields $B \\sim 10^{-6}$ G and a filling factor $f_B \\sim 10^{-3}$.\n  Two string parameters determine the emission of the particles: the symmetry\nbreaking scale $\\eta$, which for successful applications should be of order\n$10^9$--$10^{12}$ GeV, and the dimensionless parameter $i_c$, which determines\nthe maximum induced current as $J_{max} =i_c e \\eta$ and the energy of emitted\ncharge carriers as $\\epsilon_x \\sim i_c \\gamma_c \\eta$, where $e$ is the\nelectric charge of a particle.

However, in\ncalculating the afterglows, usually only the emission from the forward jet is\nconsidered. Here we present a detailed numerical study on the afterglow from\nthe receding jet. Our calculation is based on a generic dynamical description,\nand includes some delicate ingredients such as the effect of the equal arrival\ntime surface. It is found that the emission from the receding jet is generally\nrather weak. In radio bands, it usually peaks at a time of $t \\geq 1000$ d,\nwith the peak flux nearly 4 orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux of the\nforward jet. Also, it usually manifests as a short plateau in the total\nafterglow light curve, but not as an obvious rebrightening as once expected. In\noptical bands, the contribution from the receding jet is even weaker, with the\npeak flux being $\\sim 8$ orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux of the\nforward jet. We thus argue that the emission from the receding jet is very\ndifficult to detect. However, in some special cases, i.e., when the\ncircum-burst medium density is very high, or if the parameters of the receding\njet is quite different from those of the forward jet, the emission from the\nreceding jet can be significantly enhanced and may still emerge as a marked\nrebrightening. We suggest that the search for receding jet emission should\nmostly concentrate on nearby gamma-ray bursts, and the observation campaign\nshould last for at least several hundred days for each event. \n\n"}

This leads to\norder one fluctuations in the inertial to gravitational mass ratio. In Jordan\nframe, it is no longer true that all objects move on geodesics. In contrast, if\nthe scalar screening occurrs via strong coupling, such as in the DGP braneworld\nmodel, equivalence principle violation occurrs at a much reduced level.

We then proceed with the numerical calculation of the deflection angle\nin the strong field limit, when the light ray passes at the closest distance of\napproach to the limiting photon orbit. We show that the deflection angles for\nthe light ray, winding maximally rotating Kerr and braneworld black holes in\nthe same direction as their rotation, become essentially indistinguishable from\neach other for a specific value of the negative tidal charge. The same feature\noccurs in the relativistic precession frequencies at characteristic radii, for\nwhich the radial epicyclic frequency of the test particle motion attains its\nhighest value. Thus, the crucial role in a possible identification of the\nmaximally rotating Kerr and braneworld black holes would play their angular\nmomentum, which in the latter case breaches the Kerr bound in general\nrelativity. \n\n"}

We compare our Mdot_a-rho_o relation with that predicted by the\nBondi accretion model. For high luminosities comparable to the Eddington limit,\nthe power-law fit (Mdot_a ~ rho_o^q) to our models yields q=~0.5 instead of\nq=1.0 which is predicted by the Bondi model. This difference is caused by the\noutflows which are important for the overall mass budget at high luminosities.\nThe maximum momentum and mass feedback efficiencies found in our models are\n~10^-2 and ~10^-1, respectively. However, the outflows are much less important\nenergetically: their thermal and kinetic powers in units of the radiative\nluminosity are ~10^-5 and ~10^-4, respectively.

This will allow the detection of gravitational waves\ngenerated in binary systems containing black holes of intermediate mass, ~\n100-1000 solar masses. We primarily discuss two different source types --\nmergers between two intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) of comparable mass,\nand intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of smaller compact objects with\nmass ~ 1-10 solar masses into IMBHs. IMBHs may form via two channels: (i) in\ndark matter halos at high redshift through direct collapse or the collapse of\nvery massive metal-poor Population III stars, or (ii) via runaway stellar\ncollisions in globular clusters.

Though dynamically important, the\nenergy released during the r-process is not yet taken into account in merger\nsimulations. We use a nuclear reaction network to calculate the heating (due to\nbeta-decays and nuclear fission) experienced by material on the\nmarginally-bound orbits nominally responsible for late-time fall-back. Since\nmatter with longer orbital periods t_orb experiences lower densities, for\nlonger periods of time, the total r-process heating rises rapidly with t_orb,\nsuch that material with t_orb > 1 seconds can become completely unbound. Thus,\nr-process heating fundamentally changes the canonical prediction of an\nuninterrupted power-law decline in the fall-back rate dM/dt at late times. When\nthe timescale for r-process to complete is > 1 second, the heating produces a\ncomplete cut-off in fall-back accretion after ~ 1 second; if robust, this would\nimply that fall-back accretion cannot explain the late-time X-ray flaring\nobserved following some short GRBs. However, for a narrow, but physically\nplausible, range of parameters, fall-back accretion can resume after ~ 10 s,\ndespite having been strongly suppressed for ~ 1-10 s after the merger.

Since most gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) have Epeak above the energy range (15-150 keV) of the Burst Alert\nTelescope (BAT) on Swift, determining accurate Epeak values for large numbers\nof Swift bursts has been difficult. However, by combining data from Swift/BAT\nand the Suzaku Wide-band All-Sky Monitor (WAM), which covers the energy range\nfrom 50-5000 keV, for bursts which are simultaneously detected, one can\naccurately fit Epeak and Eiso and test the relationship between them for the\nSwift sample.

The\nthermal model alone can not reproduce the continuum radiation in the XMM\nspectral range, the fluorescent iron line and some broad spectral features.\nUsing the thermal jet-plus-reflection model, we find a notable contribution of\nionized reflection to the spectrum in the energy range from ~3 to 12 keV. The\nreflecting surface is highly ionized (xi ~300), the illuminating radiation\nspectrum is flat and probably strongly absorbed.

Despite this, the nature of some of\nthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the VHE emission, is\nunclear. To answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelength\ncampaign of the VHE gamma-ray emitting X-ray binary LS I +61 303 including the\nMAGIC telescope, XMM-Newton, and Swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007\nSeptember. We detect a simultaneous outburst at X-ray and VHE bands, with the\npeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. A linear fit to the\nsimultaneous X-ray/VHE pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlation\ncoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs provides\nr=0.81. Since a variable absorption of the VHE emission towards the observer is\nnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates a\nsimultaneity in the emission processes.

While independent explanations can be\nresponsible for these phenomena, we explore the possibility of their common\nGRB-related origin by modeling the GRB distribution and estimating the rates.\nFor an expected Milky Way long GRB rate, neither of the two signals is generic;\nthe local excess requires a 2% coincidence, while the signal from the galactic\ncenter requires a 20% coincidence with respect to the timing of the latest GRB.\nThe simultaneous explanation requires a 0.4% coincidence. Considering the large\nnumber of statistical \"trials\" created by multiple searches for new physics,\nthe coincidences of a few per cent cannot be dismissed as unlikely.\nAlternatively, both phenomena can be explained by GRBs if the galactic rate is\nhigher than expected.

We find that,\ndespite the impact of tidal interaction on the rotation of primary stars, the\namount of angular momentum retained in the core at the presupernova stage in\ndifferent binary model sequences converge to a value similar to those found in\nprevious single star models. This amount is large enough to produce millisecond\npulsars, but too small to produce magnetars or long gamma-ray bursts. We employ\nthe most up-to-date estimate for the Wolf-Rayet mass loss rate, and its\nimplications for SN Ib/c progenitors are discussed in detail. In terms of\nstellar structure, SN Ib/c progenitors in binary systems are predicted to have\na wide range of final masses even up to 7 Msun, with helium envelopes of 0.16 -\n1.5 Msun. Our results indicate that, if the lack of helium lines in the spectra\nof SNe Ic were due to small amounts of helium, the distribution of both initial\nand final masses of SN Ic progenitors should be bimodal. Furthermore, we find\nthat a thin hydrogen layer (0.001 - 0.01 Msun) is expected to be present in\nmany SN Ib progenitors at the presupernova stage. We show that the presence of\nhydrogen, together with a rather thick helium envelope, can lead to a\nsignificant expansion of some SN Ib/c progenitors by the time of supernova\nexplosion.

With its wide spectral\nbandpass, extending to GeV energies, Fermi is sensitive to GRBs with very large\nisotropic energy releases (10e54 erg). Although rare, these events are\nparticularly important for testing GRB central-engine models. When combined\nwith spectroscopic redshifts, our afterglow data for these four events are able\nto constrain jet collimation angles, the density structure of the circumburst\nmedium, and both the true radiated energy release and the kinetic energy of the\noutflows. In agreement with our earlier work, we find that the relativistic\nenergy budget of at least one of these events (GRB 090926A) exceeds the\ncanonical value of 10e51 erg by an order of magnitude. Such energies pose a\nsevere challenge for models in which the GRB is powered by a magnetar or\nneutrino-driven collapsar, but remain compatible with theoretical expectations\nfor magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) collapsar models. Our jet opening angles\n(theta) are similar to those found for pre-Fermi GRBs, but the large initial\nLorentz factors (Gamma_0) inferred from the detection of GeV photons imply\ntheta Gamma_0 ~ 70-90, values which are above those predicted in MHD models of\njet acceleration.

In particular we review a numerical study of pure U(1)\ngauge theory in a 4d non-commutative space.

Here we present our\ndatabase of observations, with three simultaneous energy bands in both the\noptical and the X-ray, and multiple epochs of observation for each source, all\nwith ~second or better time resolution. For the first time, we include a\ndynamical cross-correlation analysis, i.e., an investigation of how the\ncross-correlation function changes within an observation. We describe a number\nof trends which emerge. We include the full dataset of results, and pick a few\nstriking relationships from among them for further discussion.

The black hole candidate GX 339-4 exhibited an X-ray outburst in\nJanuary 2010, which is still continuing. We here discuss the timing and the\nspectral properties of the outburst using RXTE data. Aims. Our goal is to study\nthe timing and spectral properties of GX 339-4 using its recent outburst data\nand extract information about the nature of the accretion flow. Methods. We use\nRXTE archival data of the recent GX 339-4 outburst and analyze them with the\nNASA HEAsoft package, version 6.8. We then compare the observed quasi-periodic\noscillation (QPO) frequencies with those from existing shock oscillation model\nand obtain the nature of evolution of the shock locations during the outburst.\nResults. We found that the QPO frequencies are monotonically increasing from\n0.102 Hz to 5.69 Hz within a period of ~ 26 days. We explain this evolution\nwith the propagating oscillatory shock (POS) solution and find the variation of\nthe initial and final shock locations and strengths. The model fits also give\nthe velocity of the propagating shock wave, which is responsible for the\ngeneration of QPOs and their evolutions, at ~ 10 m/s. We observe from the\nspectra that up to 2010 April 10, the object was in a hard state. After that,\nit went to the hard-intermediate state. On April 18, it had a state transition\nand went to the soft-intermediate state. On May 15, another state transition\nwas observed and the source moved to the soft state. Conclusions. As in the\npreviously fitted outburst sources, this source also showed the tendency of a\nrapidly increasing QPO frequency ($\\nu_{QPO}$) in a viscous time scale, which\ncan be modeled quite accurately. In this case, the shock seems to have\ndisappeared at about ~ 172 Schwarzschild radii, unlike in the 2005 outburst of\nGRO J1655-40, where the shock disappeared behind the horizon. \n\n"}

These pulses will reach\nEarth-based telescopes dispersed, and therefore reduced in amplitude, due to\ntheir propagation through the Earth's ionosphere. To maximise the received\nsignal to noise ratio and subsequent chances of pulse detection, ionospheric\ndispersion must therefore be corrected, and since the high time resolution\nwould require excessive data storage this correction must be made in real time.\nThis requires an accurate knowledge of the dispersion characteristic which is\nparameterised by the instantaneous Total Electron Content (TEC) of the\nionosphere.

The spectrum can retain the shape of a Planck\nfunction or it can be broadened and have the shape of a Band function. This\nfact is best illustrated by studying GRB090902B: The main gamma-ray spectral\ncomponent is initially close to a Planck function, which can only be explained\nby emission from the jet photosphere. Later, the same component evolves into a\nbroader Band function. This burst thus provides observational evidence that the\nphotosphere can give rise to a non-thermal spectrum. We show that such a\nbroadening is most naturally explained by subphotospheric dissipation in the\njet. The broadening mainly depends on the strength and location of the\ndissipation, on the magnetic field strength, and on the relation between the\nenergy densities of thermal photons and of the electrons. We suggest that the\nevolution in spectral shape observed in GRB090902B is due to a decrease of the\nbulk Lorentz factor of the flow, leading to the main dissipation becoming\nsubphotospheric. Such a change in the flow parameters can also explain the\ncorrelation observed between the peak energy of the spectrum and low-energy\npower law slope, alpha, a correlation commonly observed in GRBs. We conclude\nthat photospheric emission could indeed be a ubiquitous feature during the\nprompt phase in GRBs and play a decisive role in creating the diverse spectral\nshapes and spectral evolutions that are observed. \n\n"}

Observations in the X-ray and centimetric\nradio wavelength ranges are thought to constrain some of these processes, e.g.,\ncoronal-type magnetic activity. There is a well-known empirical correlation of\nradio and X-ray luminosities in active stars, the so-called Guedel-Benz\nrelation. Previous evidence whether YSOs are compatible with this relation\nremains inconclusive for the earliest evolutionary stages. The main difficulty\nis that due to the extreme variability of these sources, simultaneous\nobservations are essential. Until now, only few YSOs and only a handful of\nprotostars have been observed simultaneously in the X-ray and radio range. To\nexpand the sample, we have obtained such observations of two young clusters\nrich in protostars, NGC 1333 and IC 348. While the absolute sensitivity is\nlower for these regions than for more nearby clusters like CrA, we find that\neven in deep continuum observations carried out with the NRAO Very Large Array,\nthe radio detection fraction for protostars in these clusters is much lower\nthan the X-ray detection fraction. Very few YSOs are detected in both bands,\nand we find the radio and X-ray populations among YSOs to be largely distinct.\nWe combine these new results with previous simultaneous Chandra and VLA\nobservations of star-forming regions and find that YSOs with detections in both\nbands appear to be offset toward higher radio luminosities for given X-ray\nluminosities when compared to the Guedel-Benz relation, although even in this\nsensitive dataset most sources are too weak for the radio detections to provide\ninformation on the emission processes.

Forty seven of the 222 BzK\ngalaxies in the central region of the CDF-S are detected at X-ray energies, 11\nof which have hard X-ray spectral slopes (Gamma<1) indicating the presence of\nheavily obscured AGN activity. The other 36 X-ray detected BzK galaxies appear\nto be relatively unobscured AGNs and starburst galaxies; we use X-ray\nvariability analyses over a rest-frame baseline of ~3 years to further confirm\nthe presence of AGN activity in many of these systems. The majority (7 out of\n11) of the heavily obscured AGNs have excess IR emission over that expected\nfrom star formation (termed \"IR-excess galaxies\"). However, we find that X-ray\ndetected heavily obscured AGNs only comprise ~25% of the IR-excess galaxy\npopulation, which is otherwise composed of relatively unobscured AGNs and\nstarburst galaxies. We find that the typical X-ray spectrum of the heavily\nobscured AGNs is better characterized by a pure reflection model than an\nabsorbed power-law model, suggesting extreme Compton-thick absorption in some\nsystems.

Gamma-ray bursts, thought to be associated to\ncollapsing or merging stellar-mass objects at cosmological distances, are also\naccreting highly relativistic jet sources that shine strongly at high energies.\nThese are very short-duration events, but they are also the most luminous.\nRecently, star formation galaxies have turned out to be also gamma-ray\nemitters. On the other hand, clusters of galaxies have not been detected beyond\nX-rays yet. These are the largest known structures in the Universe; in their\nformation through accretion and merging, shocks and turbulence are generated,\nwhich may lead to gamma-ray production. In this work, the gamma-ray physics of\nAGNs is briefly presented, as well as that of starburst galaxies, GRBs and\nclusters of galaxies. Afterwards, we consider some particular cases of\ngamma-ray production in non-blazar AGN jets interacting with their medium at\ndifferent scales. \n\n"}

Theory suggests that rotating Wolf-Rayet stars are the best\ncandidates, but their strong stellar winds shroud their surfaces, preventing a\ndirect measurement of their rotation. Fortunately, linear spectropolarimetry\nmay be used to probe the flattening of their winds due to stellar spin.\nSpectropolarimetry surveys show that an 80% majority of WR stars have\nspherically symmetric winds and are thus rotating slowly, yet a small 20%\nminority display a spectropolarimetric signature indicative of rotation. Here\nwe find a highly significant correlation between WR objects that carry the\nsignature of stellar rotation and the subset of WR stars with ejecta nebulae\nthat have only recently transitioned from a red sugergiant or luminous blue\nvariable phase. As these youthful WR stars have yet to spin-down due to mass\nloss, they are the best candidate GRB progenitors identified to date.

Here we examine the apparent radius in a\nhomogeneous sample of long, mixed H/He bursts from the low-mass X-ray binaries\nGS 1826-24 and KS 1731-26. The measured blackbody normalisation (proportional\nto the emitting area) in these bursts is constant over a period of up to 60s in\nthe burst tail, even though the flux (blackbody temperature) decreased by a\nfactor of 60-75% (30-40%). The typical rms variation in the mean normalisation\nfrom burst to burst was 3-5%, although a variation of 17% was found between\nbursts observed from GS 1826-24 in two epochs. A comparison of the\ntime-resolved spectroscopic measurements during bursts from the two epochs\nshows that the normalisation evolves consistently through the burst rise and\npeak, but subsequently increases further in the earlier epoch bursts.

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio. This method in principle can also be applied to any accreting\ncompact objects with detectable accretion disk wind absorption line features. \n\n"}

Abstract: We show how one can estimate the multipole moments of the space-time,\nassuming that the quasi-periodic modulations of the X-ray flux (quasi-periodic\noscillations), observed from accreting neutron stars or black holes, are due to\norbital and precession frequencies (relativistic precession model). The\nprecession frequencies $\\Omega_{\\rho}$ and $\\Omega_z$ can be expressed as\nexpansions on the orbital frequency $\\Omega$, in which the moments enter the\ncoefficients in a prescribed form. Thus, observations can be fitted to these\nexpressions in order to evaluate the moments. If the compact object is a\nneutron star, constrains can be imposed on the equation of state. The same\nanalysis can be used for black holes as a test for the validity of the no-hair\ntheorem. Alternatively, instead of fitting for the moments, observations can be\nmatched to frequencies calculated from analytic models that are produced so as\nto correspond to realistic neutron stars described by various equations of\nstate. Observations can thus be used to constrain the equation of state and\npossibly other physical parameters (mass, rotation, quadrupole, etc.) Some\ndistinctive features of the frequencies, which become evident by using the\nanalytic models, are discussed. \n\n"}

In\nthis paper we discuss various ways of using these high resolution data to\nconstrain velocity power spectrum in galaxy clusters. We argue that variations\nof these quantities with the projected distance R in cool core clusters contain\nimportant information on the velocity field length scales in the ICM. The\neffective length $l_{\\rm eff}$ along the line of sight, which provides dominant\ncontribution to the line flux, increases with R, allowing one to probe the\namplitude of the velocity variations at different spatial scales. In\nparticular, we show that the width of the line as a function of R is closely\nlinked to the structure function of the 3D velocity field. Yet another easily\nobtainable proxy of the velocity field length scales is the ratio of the\namplitude of the projected velocity field (line energy) variations to the\ndispersion of the velocity along the line of sight (line width). Finally the\nprojected velocity field can be easily converted into 3D velocity field,\nespecially for clusters like Coma with an extended flat core in the surface\nbrightness. Under assumption of a homogeneous isotropic Gaussian 3D velocity\nfield we derived simple expressions relating the power spectrum of the 3D\nvelocity field (or structure function) and the observables.

We examine steady-state\nconfigurations of the disk and migrating SMBH system, self-consistently\naccounting for tidal and viscous torques and heating, radiative diffusion\nlimited cooling, gas and radiation pressure, and the decay of the binary's\norbit. We obtain a \"phase diagram\" of the system as a function of binary\nparameters, showing regimes in which both the disk structure and migration have\na different character. Although massive binaries can create a central gap in\nthe disk at large radii, the tidal barrier of the secondary causes a\nsignificant pile-up of gas outside of its orbit, which can lead to the closing\nof the gap. We find that this spillover occurs at an orbital separation as\nlarge as ~200 M_7^{-1/2} gravitational radii, where M = 10^7 M_7 Msun is the\ntotal binary mass. If the secondary is less massive than ~10^6 Msun, then the\ngap is closed before gravitational waves (GWs) start dominating the orbital\ndecay. In this regime, the disk is still strongly perturbed, but the piled-up\ngas continuously overflows as in a porous dam, and crosses inside the\nsecondary's orbit. The corresponding migration rate, which we label Type 1.5,\nis slower than the usual limiting cases known as Type I and II migration.\nCompared to an unperturbed disk, the steady-state disk in the overflowing\nregime is up to several hundred times brighter in the optical bands. Surveys\nsuch as PanSTARRS or LSST may discover the periodic variability of this\npopulation of binaries. Our results imply that the circumbinary disks around\nSMBHs can extend to small radii during the last stages of their merger, when\nthey are detectable by LISA, and may produce coincident electromagnetic (EM)\nemission similar to active galactic nuclei (AGN). \n\n"}

We develop a multilevel\nBayesian framework for assessing association of UHECRs and candidate source\npopulations, and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for estimating model\nparameters and comparing models by computing, via Chib's method, marginal\nlikelihoods and Bayes factors.

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM.

Muon\nenergy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss\n(dE/dx) along the muon's path and relating the dE/dx to the muon energy.\nBecause high-energy muons (E_mu > 1 TeV) lose energy randomly, the spread in\ndE/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 in\nlog10(E_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the IceCube\ndetector. In this paper, we present an improved method that uses a truncated\nmean and other techniques to determine the muon energy. The muon track is\ndivided into separate segments with individual dE/dx values. The elimination of\nsegments with the highest dE/dx results in an overall dE/dx that is more\nclosely correlated to the muon energy. This method results in an energy\nresolution of 0.22 in log10(E_mu), which gives a 26% improvement. This\ntechnique is applicable to any large water or ice detector and potentially to\nlarge scintillator or liquid argon detectors. \n\n"}

Astrometric parameters are commonly derived by fitting them as\nparameters of a timing model to a series of pulse times of arrival (TOAs). TOAs\nmeasured to microsecond precision over several-year spans can yield position\nmeasurements with sub-milliarcsecond precision. However, timing-based\nastrometry can become biased if a pulsar displays any red spin noise, which can\nbe compared to the red noise signal produced by the stochastic gravitational\nwave background. We investigate how noise of different spectral types is\nabsorbed by timing models, leading to significant estimation errors in the\nastrometric parameters. We find that commonly used techniques for fitting\ntiming models in the presence of red noise (Cholesky whitening) prevent the\nabsorption of noise into the timing model remarkably well if the time baseline\nof observations exceeds several years, but are inadequate for dealing with\nshorter pulsar data sets.

Therefore, the X-ray emission from lensed quasars is\nfirst strongly lensed by the black hole before it is lensed by the foreground\ngalaxy and star fields. We present a scheme that combines the initial strong\nlensing of a Kerr black hole with standard linearized microlensing by\nintervening stars. We find that X-ray microlensed light curves incorporating\nKerr strong gravity can differ significantly from standard curves. The\namplitude of the fluctuations in the light curves can increase or decrease by\n~0.65-0.75 mag by including Kerr strong gravity. Larger inclination angles give\nlarger amplitude fluctuations in the microlensing light curves. Consequently,\ncurrent X-ray microlensing observations might have under or overestimated the\nsizes of the X-ray emission regions. We estimate this bias using a simple\nmetric based on the amplitude of magnitude fluctuations. The half light radius\nof the X-ray emission region can be underestimated up to ~50% or overestimated\nup to ~20%. Underestimates are found in most situations we have investigated.\nThe only exception is for a disk with large spin, radially flat emission\nprofile, and observed nearly face on, where an overestimate is found. Thus,\nmore accurate microlensing size constraints should be obtainable by including\nKerr lensing. The caustic crossing time can differ by months after including\nKerr strong gravity. A simultaneous monitoring of gravitational lensed quasars\nin both X-ray and optical bands with densely sampled X-ray light curves might\nreveal this feature.

The disc is initially threaded by a weak magnetic field\nwhere the magnetic pressure is significantly less than the kinetic pressure in\nthe disc. The viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are modelled by two \"alpha\"\nparameters, while the coronal region above the disc is treated using ideal MHD.\nThe initial magnetic field is taken to consist of three poloidal field loops\nthreading the disc. The motivation for this study is to understand the\nadvection of disc matter and magnetic field by the turbulent/diffusive disc. At\nearly times the innermost field loop twists and its field lines become open.\nThe twisting of the opened field lines leads to the formation of both an inner\ncollimated, magnetically-dominated jet, and at larger distances from the axis a\nmatter dominated uncollimated wind. For later times, the strength of the\nmagnetic field decreases owing to field reconnection and annihilation in the\ndisc. For the early times, we have derived from the simulations both the matter\naccretion speed in the disc and the accretion speed of the magnetic field. We\nshow that the derived matter accretion speed agrees approximately with the\npredictions of a model where the accretion speed is the sum of two terms, one\ndue to the disc's viscosity (which gives a radial outflow of angular momentum\nin the disc), and a second due to the twisted magnetic field at the disc's\nsurface (which gives a vertical outflow of angular momentum). For early times\nwe find that the magnetic contribution is roughly twice the viscous\ncontribution for the case where the alpha parameters are both equal to 0.1.

However, with only\nthree giant flares ever recorded, and only two with data of sufficient quality\nto search for QPOs, such analysis is seriously data limited. We set out a\nprocedure for doing QPO searches in the far more numerous, short, less\nenergetic magnetar bursts. The short, transient nature of these bursts requires\nthe implementation of sophisticated statistical techniques to make reliable\ninferences. Using Bayesian statistics, we model the periodogram as a\ncombination of red noise at low frequencies and white noise at high\nfrequencies, which we show is a conservative approach to the problem. We use\nempirical models to make inferences about the potential signature of periodic\nand quasi-periodic oscillations at these frequencies. We compare our method\nwith previously used techniques and find that although it is on the whole more\nconservative, it is also more reliable in ruling out false positives.

It is\nproposed that the stellar and pulsar winds have to mix at some distance from\nthe binary system, defined by the orbital period of the companion stars and the\nvelocity of the stellar wind. The mixed pulsar-stellar wind expands with a\nspecific velocity determined by the pulsar power and the mass loss rate of the\ncompanion star. Relativistic particles, either from the inner pulsar\nmagnetosphere and/or accelerated at the shocks between stellar and pulsar\nwinds, are expected to be captured and isotropized in the reference frame of\nthe mixed wind. Therefore, they can efficiently comptonize stellar radiation\nproducing GeV-TeV $\\gamma$-rays in the inverse Compton process. We calculate\nthe $\\gamma$-ray spectra expected in such scenario for the two example binary\nsystems: J1816+4510 which is the redback type millisecond binary and LS 5039\nwhich is supposed to contain energetic pulsar.

The light curve\npeaked at z_P1=21.7 mag, making PS1-10afx comparable to the most luminous known\nSNe, with M_u = -22.3 mag. Our extensive optical and NIR observations indicate\nthat the bolometric light curve of PS1-10afx rose on the unusually fast\ntimescale of ~12 d to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1e44 erg/s (M_bol\n= -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. Equally important, the SED is\nunusually red for a SLSN, with a color temperature of 6800 K near maximum\nlight, in contrast to previous H-poor SLSNe, which are bright in the UV. The\nspectra more closely resemble those of a normal SN Ic than any known SLSN, with\na photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in the\nrest-frame UV. Despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very large\nemitting radius (>5e15 cm). We demonstrate that no existing theoretical model\ncan satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (i) a nickel-powered\nlight curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fast\ntimescale; (ii) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly-rotating\nmagnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (iii) models\ninvoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain the\nobserved spectra or color evolution.

To investigate the\nstructural evolution of another type of celestial bodies, we use the MESA code\nto extend these calculations to gaseous planets. We show that this function is\nconserved for all models during the whole planetary evolution and is\nindependent of the planet mass. We also analyse the cases for which this\nfunction is not conserved during some stellar evolutionary phases. For the PMS\nto the WD cooling sequences, we have found a connection between the strong\nvariations of \\Gamma(M, EOS) during the intermediary evolutionary phases and\nthe specific nuclear power. A threshold for the specific nuclear power was\ndetermined. Below this limit this function is invariant (~ 0.4) for these\nmodels, i.e., at the initial and final stages (PMS and WD).

Therefore, we confirm that regardless of the final\nproducts of the stellar evolution, NS or WD, they recover the initial value of\n\\Gamma(M, EOS) ~ 0.4 acquired at the PMS.

We expect the jet's acceleration to produce a GW\nMemory signal. While all relativistic jet models display anti-beaming of GW\nradiation away from the jet axis, thus radiating away from directions of GRBs'\ngamma radiation, this effect is not overwhelming. The decrease of the signal\namplitude towards the cone of gamma-ray detectability is weak, and for some\nmodels and parameters the GW signal reaches a significant amplitude for much of\nthe gamma-ray cone. Thus both signals may be jointly detected. We find\ndifferent waveforms and fourier signatures for uniform jets and structured jet\nmodels - thus offering a method of using GW signatures to probe the internal\nstructure and acceleration of GRB jets. The GW signal peaks just outside the\njet (core) of a uniform (structuted) jet. Within the jet (core) the GW signal\ndisplays wiggles, due to a polarization effect; thus for a uniform jet, the\npeak amplitude accompanies a smoother signal than the peak of a structured jet.\nFor the most probable detection angle and for typical GRB parameters, we expect\nfrequencies < ~600Hz and amplitudes h~10^-25. Our estimates of the expected\nsignals suggest that the signals are not strong enough for a single cluster of\nDECIGO nor for aLIGO's sensitivities. However, sensitivies of ~10^-25/sqrt(Hz)\nin the DECIGO band should suffice to detect typical long GRBs at 2Gpc and short\nGRBs at 200Mpc, implying a monthly event of a long GRB and a detection of a\nshort GRB every decade. In addition, we expect much more frequent detection of\nGW from GRBs directed away from us, including orphan afterglows. The ultimate\nDECIGO sensitivy should increase the range and enable detecting these signals\nin all models even to high cosmological z. \n\n"}

Although the gamma-process in massive stars has been\nsuccessful in producing a large range of p-nuclei, significant deficiences\nremain. An increasing number of processes and sites has been studied in recent\nyears in search of viable alternatives replacing or supplementing the massive\nstar models. A large number of unstable nuclei, however, with only\ntheoretically predicted reaction rates are included in the reaction network and\nthus the nuclear input may also bear considerable uncertainties. The current\nstatus of astrophysical models, nuclear input, and observational constraints is\nreviewed. After an overview of currently discussed models, the focus is on the\npossibility to better constrain those models through different means.\nMeteoritic data not only provide the actual isotopic abundances of the p-nuclei\nbut can also put constraints on the possible contribution of proton-rich\nnucleosynthesis. The main part of the review focusses on the nuclear\nuncertainties involved in the determination of the astrophysical reaction rates\nrequired for the extended reaction networks used in nucleosynthesis studies.\nExperimental approaches are discussed together with their necessary connection\nto theory, which is especially pronounced for reactions with intermediate and\nheavy nuclei in explosive nuclear burning, even close to stability. \n\n"}

For\nan assumed value of B, we evaluate the daily GeV pair-echo flux expected from\nthe TeV data, select the dates where this exceeds the Fermi 2-\\sigma\nsensitivity, compute the probability that this flux is excluded by the Fermi\ndata for each date, and then combine the probabilities using the inverse normal\nmethod.

Using a\nsource model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometric\nluminosities $\\sim 8 \\times 10^{44}$ ergs/s uniformly distributed per unit\ncomoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density as\na function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found by\nThornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate and\nredshift probed by a given survey. The non-detection of any such events in\nArecibo 1.4 GHz survey data by Deneva et al., and the Allen Telescope Array\nsurvey by Simeon et al. is consistent with our model. Ongoing surveys in the\n1--2 GHz band should result in further discoveries. At lower frequencies,\nassuming a typical radio spectral index $\\alpha=-1.4$, the predicted peak flux\ndensities are 10s of Jy. As a result, surveys of such a population with current\nfacilities would not necessarily be sensitivity limited and could be carried\nout with small arrays to maximize the sky coverage.

The\ndata reveal a repeating pattern, including a triple flare structure, in the\nproperties of each \\gamma-ray outburst, which implies similar mechanism(s) and\nlocation for all three events. The multi-frequency behavior indicates that the\nlower frequency events are co-spatial with the \\gamma-ray outbursts, although\nthe \\gamma-ray emission varies on the shortest timescales. We determine that\nthe variability from UV to IR wavelengths during an outburst results from a\nsingle synchrotron component whose properties do not change significantly over\nthe different outbursts. Despite a general increase in the degree of optical\nlinear polarization during an outburst, the polarization drops significantly at\nthe peak of the \\gamma-ray event, which suggests that both shocks and turbulent\nprocesses are involved.

A\nbasic challenge in the program to compute the GSF for orbits around a Kerr\nblack hole is that the standard procedure for reconstructing the perturbation\nis formulated in a class of radiation gauges, in which the particle singularity\nis non-isotropic and extends away from the particle's location. Here we present\ntwo practical schemes for calculating the GSF using a radiation-gauge\nreconstructed metric as input. The schemes are based on a detailed analysis of\nthe local structure of the particle singularity in the radiation gauges. We\nidentify 3 types of radiation gauges: two containing a radial string-like\nsingularity emanating from the particle, either in one direction (\"half-string\"\ngauges) or both directions (\"full-string\" gauges); and a third type containing\nno strings but with a jump discontinuity across a surface intersecting the\nparticle.

Abstract: Short-hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are widely believed to be produced by the\nmerger of two binary compact objects, specifically by two neutron stars or by a\nneutron star orbiting a black hole. According to the Li-Paczynski kilonova\nmodel, the merger would launch sub-relativistic ejecta and a\nnear-infrared/optical transient would then occur, lasting up to days, which is\npowered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized in the ejecta.\nThe detection of a late bump using the {\\em Hubble Space Telescope} ({\\em HST})\nin the near-infrared afterglow light curve of the short-hard GRB 130603B is\nindeed consistent with such a model. However, as shown in this Letter, the\nlimited {\\em HST} near-infrared lightcurve behavior can also be interpreted as\nthe synchrotron radiation of the external shock driven by a wide mildly\nrelativistic outflow. In such a scenario, the radio emission is expected to\npeak with a flux of $\\sim 100 \\mu$Jy, which is detectable for current radio\narrays. Hence, the radio afterglow data can provide complementary evidence on\nthe nature of the bump in GRB 130603B. It is worth noting that good\nspectroscopy during the bump phase in short-hard bursts can test validity of\neither model above, analogous to spectroscopy of broad-lined Type Ic supernova\nin long-soft GRBs. \n\n"}

ICECUBE claimed that a\ncomponent (10:6+5:0 3:6), a third, of these events must be a trace of expected\ndownward muons and-or atmospheric neutrinos (muon track dominated): The\nprobability that this scenario occurs is very poor, about 0.1- 0.5%. The\nparadox might be mitigate as we suggest if nearly all of the 28 events are\noriginated by extraterrestrial sources arriving to us in de-coherent states.

Pulsars in these binary systems are\nexpected to produce winds which, colliding with stellar winds, create\nconditions for acceleration of electrons. These electrons should interact with\nthe anisotropic radiation from the companion stars producing gamma-ray emission\nmodulated with the orbital period of the binary system. We consider the\ninteraction of a millisecond pulsar (MSP) wind with a very inhomogeneous\nstellar wind from the companion star within binary systems of the Black Widow\nand Redback types. It is expected that the pulsar wind should mix efficiently\nwith the inhomogeneous stellar wind.

Recent\nmultiwavelength observations of Galactic black hole transients show that the\nsituation is not so simple. Fast variability in the OIR band, OIR excesses\nabove the thermal emission and a complicated interplay between the X-ray and\nthe OIR light curves imply that the OIR emitting region is much more compact.\nOne of the popular hypotheses is that the jet contributes to the OIR emission\nand even is responsible for the bulk of the X-rays. However, this scenario is\nlargely ad hoc and is in contradiction with many previously established facts.\nAlternatively, the hot accretion flow, known to be consistent with the X-ray\nspectral and timing data, is also a viable candidate to produce the OIR\nradiation. The hot-flow scenario naturally explains the power-law like OIR\nspectra, fast OIR variability and its complex relation to the X-rays if the hot\nflow contains non-thermal electrons (even in energetically negligible\nquantities), which are required by the presence of the MeV tail in Cyg X-1. The\npresence of non-thermal electrons also lowers the equilibrium electron\ntemperature in the hot flow model to <100 keV, making it more consistent with\nobservations.

Here\nwe present an analysis of the red Ly alpha damping wing of the afterglow\nspectrum taken by Subaru/FOCAS during 10.4-13.2 hr after the burst.

Such a\ncurvature in the short wavelength range cannot be explained either by\nextinction at the host with standard extinction curves, intrinsic curvature of\nafterglow spectra, or by the known systematic uncertainties in the observed\nspectrum. The red damping wing by intervening HI gas outside the host can\nreduce the residual by about 3 sigma statistical significance. We find that a\ndamped Ly alpha system is not favored as the origin of this intervening HI\nabsorption, from the observed Ly beta and metal absorption features. Therefore\nabsorption by diffuse IGM remains as a plausible explanation.

Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to be excellent laboratories for determining\nthe equation of state (EoS) of cold dense matter. Their strong gravity suggests\nthat they can also be used to constrain gravity models. The mass and radius\n(M-R) of a NS both depend on the choice of EoS and gravity, meaning that NSs\ncannot be simultaneously good laboratories for both of these questions. A\nmeasurement of M-R would constrain the less well known physics input. The\nassumption that M-R measurements can be used to constrain EoS-presumes general\nrelativity (GR) is the ultimate model of gravity in the classical regime. We\ncalculate the radial profile of compactness and curvature (square root of the\nfull contraction of the Weyl tensor) within a NS and determine the domain not\nprobed by the Solar System tests of GR. We find that, except for a tiny sphere\nof radius less than a millimeter at the center, the curvature is several orders\nof magnitude above the values present in Solar System tests. The compactness is\nbeyond the solar surface value for r>10 m, and increases by 5 orders of\nmagnitude towards the surface. With the density being only an order of\nmagnitude higher than that probed by nuclear scattering experiments, our\nresults suggest that the employment of GR as the theory of gravity describing\nthe hydrostatic equilibrium of NSs is a rather remarkable extrapolation from\nthe regime of tested validity, as opposed to that of EoS models. Our larger\nignorance of gravity within NSs suggests that a measurement of M-R constrains\ngravity rather than EoS, and given that EoS has yet to be determined by nucleon\nscattering experiments, M-R measurements cannot tightly constrain the gravity\nmodels either. Near the surface the curvature and compactness attain their\nlargest values, while EoS in this region is fairly well known. This renders the\ncrust as the best site to look for deviations from GR. \n\n"}

As cosmic\nrays are mostly charged nuclei, their trajectories are deflected by the action\nof galactic magnetic field they propagate through before reaching the Earth\natmosphere, so that their detection carries directional information only up to\ndistances as large as their gyro-radius.

Both the number of shocks comprising an individual\nradio outburst (3-4) and the range of the compression ratios of the individual\nshocks (0.5-0.8) are similar in all three sources; the shocks are found to be\nforward-moving with respect to the flow.

The instrumental dead time per\nevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percent\nevent-to-event. The most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noise\nlevel in the power density spectrum (PDS) that cannot be modeled easily with\nthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time. In this\npaper, we show that it is possible to exploit the presence of two completely\nindependent focal planes and use the cross power density spectrum to obtain a\ngood proxy of the white noise-subtracted PDS.

Whereas their stellar masses $M_*$ have a\nrather narrow distribution, the population of GRBs is very diverse, with\ngamma-ray luminosities $L_\\gamma$ spanning several orders of magnitude. This\nsuggests the existence of a \"hidden\" stellar variable whose burst-to-burst\nvariation leads to a spread in $L_\\gamma$. Whatever this hidden variable is,\nits variation should not noticeably affect the shape of GRB lightcurves, which\ndisplay a constant luminosity (in a time-average sense) followed by a sharp\ndrop at the end of the burst seen with Swift/XRT. We argue that such a hidden\nvariable is progenitor star's large-scale magnetic flux. Shortly after the core\ncollapse, most of stellar magnetic flux accumulates near the black hole (BH)\nand remains there. The flux extracts BH rotational energy and powers jets of\nroughly a constant luminosity, $L_j$. However, once BH mass accretion rate\n$\\dot M$ falls below $\\sim L_j/c^2$, the flux becomes dynamically important and\ndiffuses outwards, with the jet luminosity set by the rapidly declining mass\naccretion rate, $L_j\\sim \\dot M c^2$. This provides a potential explanation for\nthe sharp end of GRBs and the universal shape of their lightcurves. During the\nGRB, gas infall translates spatial variation of stellar magnetic flux into\ntemporal variation of $L_j$. We make use of the deviations from constancy in\n$L_j$ to perform stellar magnetic flux \"tomography\".

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data.

It is much smaller than the dispersion measure distance of\n$\\sim$12 kpc but compatible with a $\\gamma$-ray \"pseudo-distance\" of 1 kpc.\nBased on that and the optical upper limits, we conclude that PSR J2021+3651,\nsimilar to the Vela pulsar, is a very inefficient nonthermal emitter in the\noptical and X-rays, while its $\\gamma$-ray efficiency is consistent with an\naverage efficiency for $\\gamma$-pulsars of similar age.

Absolute\n  Flux Calibration Abstract: Many techniques for measuring neutron star radii rely on absolute flux\nmeasurements in the X-rays. As a result, one of the fundamental uncertainties\nin these spectroscopic measurements arises from the absolute flux calibrations\nof the detectors being used. Using the stable X-ray burster, GS 1826-238, and\nits simultaneous observations by Chandra HETG/ACIS-S and RXTE/PCA as well as by\nXMM-Newton EPIC-pn and RXTE/PCA, we quantify the degree of uncertainty in the\nflux calibration by assessing the differences between the measured fluxes\nduring bursts.

However, great progress in this area has been\nmade in recent years due to the data collected by the present generation of\nground based detectors like the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array.\nIn particular, it is believed that the study of the composition of the cosmic\nrays as a function of energy can play a fundamental role for the understanding\nof the origin of the cosmic rays. The observatories belonging to this\ngeneration are composed of arrays of surface detectors and fluorescence\ntelescopes. The duty cycle of the fluorescence telescopes is ~10 % in contrast\nwith the ~100 % of the surface detectors. Therefore, the energy calibration of\nthe events observed by the surface detectors is performed by using a\ncalibration curve obtained from a set of high quality events observed in\ncoincidence by both types of detectors. The advantage of this method is that\nthe reconstructed energy of the events observed by the surface detectors\nbecomes almost independent of simulations of the showers because just a small\npart of the reconstructed energy, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes,\ncomes from simulations. However, the calibration curve obtained in this way\ndepends on the composition of the cosmic rays, which can introduce biases in\ncomposition analyses when parameters with a strong dependence on primary energy\nare considered.

Since redshifts are usually measured from the optical spectrum of the\nafterglow, correlations between prompt and afterglow emissions may introduce\nbiases in the distribution of rest-frame properties of the prompt emission,\nespecially considering that we measure the redshift of only one third of Swift\nGRBs.\n  In this paper we study the brightness of optical GRB afterglows and the role\nof optical selection effects in the distribution of various intrinsic\nproperties of GRBs and on the Epi - Eiso relation discovered by Amati et al.\n(2002). Our analysis is based on a sample of 85 GRBs with good optical\nfollow-up and well measured prompt emission. 71 of them have a measure of\nredshift and 14 have no redshift. We discuss the connection between the\nlocation of GRBs in the Epi-Eiso plane and their optical brightness measured\ntwo hours after the trigger in the GRB rest frame.

Abstract: The external forward shock (EFS) models have been the standard paradigm to\ninterpret the broad-band afterglow data of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). One\nprediction of the models is that some afterglow temporal breaks at different\nenergy bands should be achromatic. Observations in the Swift era have revealed\nchromatic afterglow behaviors at least in some GRBs, casting doubts on the EFS\norigin of GRB afterglows. In this paper, we perform a systematic study to\naddress the question: how bad/good are the external forward shock models? Our\nsample includes 85 GRBs well-monitored X-ray and optical lightcurves. Based on\nhow well the data abide by the EFS models, we categorize them as: Gold sample:\n(Grade I and II) include 45/85 GRBs. They show evidence of, or are consistent\nwith having, an achromatic break. The temporal/spectral behaviors in each\nafterglow segment are consistent with the predictions (closure relations) of\nthe EFS models. Silver sample: (Grade III and IV) include 37/85 GRBs. They are\nalso consistent with having an achromatic break, even though one or more\nafterglow segments do not comply with the closure relations. Bad sample: (Grade\nV), 3/85 shows direct evidence of chromatic behaviors, suggesting that the EFS\nmodels are inconsistent with the data. These are included in the Bad sample. We\nfurther perform statistical analyses of various observational properties\n($\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $t_b$ and model parameters (energy injection index q, p,\n$\\theta_j$, $\\eta_\\gamma$, etc) of the GRBs in the Gold Sample, and derive\nconstraints on the magnetization parameter $\\epsilon_B$ in the EFS. Overall, we\nconclude that the simplest EFS models can account for the multi-wavelength\nafterglow data of at least half of the GRBs. When more advanced modeling (e.g.,\nlong-lasting reverse shock, structured jets) is invoked, up to $>90 \\%$ of the\nafterglows may be interpreted within the framework of the ESF models. \n\n"}

In particular, it was estimated to what extent the\ncombined information from multiple detections would enable one to distinguish\nbetween different equations of state through hypothesis ranking or parameter\nestimation. Under the assumption of zero neutron star spins both in signals and\nin template waveforms and considering tidal effects to 1 post-Newtonian (1PN)\norder, it was found that O(20) sources would suffice to distinguish between a\nhard, moderate, and soft equation of state. Here we revisit these results, this\ntime including neutron star tidal effects to the highest order currently known,\ntermination of gravitational waveforms at the contact frequency, neutron star\nspins, and the resulting quadrupole-monopole interaction.

The current experiments combine two different techniques, an array\nof surface detectors and fluorescence telescopes. The latter allow an almost\ncalorimetric measurement of the primary energy. Thus, hadron-initiated showers\ndetected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator\nfrom the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance\nfrom the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy. On the other hand, this\ncalibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high\nenergy photon has been unambiguously detected so far. Therefore, pure Monte\nCarlo parametrizations are used instead.\n  In this work, we present a new method to determine the primary energy of\nhadron-induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously\ndeveloped for photon primaries. It consists on a set of calibration curves that\nrelate the surface energy estimator, S(r0), and the depth of maximum\ndevelopment of the shower, Xmax, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes.\nThen, the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since\nS(r0) and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed. Considering\na mixed sample of ultra-high energy proton and iron primaries and taking into\naccount the reconstruction uncertainties and shower to shower fluctuations, we\ndemonstrate that the primary energy may be determined with a systematic\nuncertainty below 1% and resolution around 16% in the energy range from\n10^{18.5} to 10^{19.6} eV.

These energies\nare unattainable experimentally. However, minute deviations from Lorentz\ninvariance may still be present at much lower energies. These deviations can\naccumulate over large distances, making astrophysical measurements the most\nsensitive tests of Lorentz symmetry. One effect of Lorentz invariance violation\nis an energy dependent photon dispersion of the vacuum resulting in differences\nof the light travel time from distant objects. The Standard-Model Extension\n(SME) is an effective theory to describe the low-energy behavior of a more\nfundamental Grand Unified Theory, including Lorentz and CPT violating terms. In\nthe SME the Lorentz violating operators can in part be classified by their\nmass-dimension d, with the lowest order being d=5. However, measurements of\nphoton polarization have constrained operators with d=5 setting lower limits on\nthe energy at which they become dominant well beyond the Planck scale.

The AKARI performed an all sky\nsurvey in 6 IR bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160$\\mu$m) with 3-10 times better\nsensitivity than IRAS, covering the crucial far-IR wavelengths across the peak\nof the dust emission. Combined with a better spatial resolution, AKARI can\nmeasure the total infrared luminosity ($L_{TIR}$) of individual galaxies much\nmore precisely, and thus, the total infrared luminosity density of the local\nUniverse. In the AKARI NEP deep field, we construct restframe 8$\\mu$m,\n12$\\mu$m, and total infrared (TIR) luminosity functions (LFs) at 0.15$<z<$2.2\nusing 4128 infrared sources.

Since early in the CGRO\nera, the empirical Band function has been considered a good description of the\nkeV-MeV spectra although its shape is very often inconsistent with the\npredictions of the pure synchrotron emission scenarios. We have recently\nestablished a new observational model analyzing data of the NASA Fermi\nGamma-ray Space Telescope. In this model, GRB prompt emission is a combination\nof three main emission components: (i) a thermal-like component that we\ninterpreted so far as the jet photosphere emission, (ii) a non-thermal\ncomponent that we interpreted so far as synchrotron radiation, and (iii) an\nadditional non-thermal (cutoff) power-law most likely of inverse Compton\norigin. In this article we reanalyze some of the bright GRBs observed with\nCGRO/BATSE with the new model, namely GRBs 941017, 970111 and 990123. We\nconclude that BATSE data are fully consistent with the recent results obtained\nwith Fermi: some bright BATSE GRBs exhibit three separate components during the\nprompt phase with similar spectral parameters as these reported from Fermi\ndata. In addition, the analysis of the BATSE GRBs with the new model results in\na relation between the time-resolved energy flux of the non-thermal component\nand its corresponding $\\nu$F$_\\nu$ peak energy (i.e.,\nF$_{i}^{nTh}$-E$_{peak,i}^{nTh}$) that has a similar index as the one initially\nderived from Fermi data.

A template-based method, which can be used to reconstruct the charge and\nenergy of primary particles simultaneously from images taken by IACTs, will be\nintroduced.

How the bubbles connect to the Galactic plane is unclear. We\nfind that bubble-like emission is not only found in the halo, but it is\nstrongly present in the Galactic plane as well with a morphology close to the\nspatial distribution of the 1.8 MeV gamma-ray line from 26Al, a radioactive\nnucleus synthesized in SNRs. In addition, the spectral shape of this hard\ncomponent coincides with the predicted spectrum from cosmic rays trapped in\nsources. Hence, we propose that the bubble-like emission in the plane has a\nhadronic origin, which arises from SCRs. The bubbles in the halo have the same\nenergy spectrum, which suggests that they are outflows from the plane with the\ngamma-rays arising from hadronic interactions of protons trapped in a plasma of\nadvected gas. Towards the Galactic center (GC) we observe the 1-3 GeV excess,\nbut observe this excess in addition in all regions where there is strong 26Al\nproduction. This excludes the dark matter annihilation interpretation. Instead,\nwe propose that the excess is caused by a deficit of the CRs at low rigidities\nin the regions of dense molecular clouds, which are characterized by higher\nenergy losses and stronger stellar winds. The 26Al line is a tracer of such\nregions. If we introduce a break in the cosmic ray injection spectra in the\nregions of strong 26Al production to effectively take the deficit of low\nrigidity CRs into account, the excess in the Galactic plane and towards the GC\nboth disappear. We thus conclude that the excess in the Galactic center is\nlargely an artefact from the excess in the Galactic plane. The correlation\nbetween the two originates simply from the lines-of-sight towards the GC\ncrossing the Galactic plane. \n\n"}

All models develop explosions, but depending on the progenitor\nstructure, they can be divided into two classes. With a steep density decline\nat the Si/Si-O interface, the arrival of this interface at the shock front\nleads to a sudden drop of the mass-accretion rate, triggering a rapid approach\nto explosion. With a more gradually decreasing accretion rate, it takes longer\nfor the neutrino heating to overcome the accretion ram pressure and explosions\nset in later. Early explosions are facilitated by high mass-accretion rates\nafter bounce and correspondingly high neutrino luminosities combined with a\npronounced drop of the accretion rate and ram pressure at the Si/Si-O\ninterface. Because of rapidly shrinking neutron star radii and receding shock\nfronts after the passage through their maxima, our models exhibit short\nadvection time scales, which favor the efficient growth of the standing\naccretion-shock instability.

We consider in detail a contribution\nfrom a standard blackbody accretion disc, testing whether its inner radius can\nbe set equal to that of the reflector. However, this leads to an unphysical\nbehaviour of the disc truncation radius, implying the soft X-ray component is\nnot a standard blackbody disc. This appears to be due to irradiation by the\nhard X-rays, which strongly dominate the total emission.

They deduced this from the fact that\nthe convergence error obtained in reconstructing the luminosity function of\npulsars using an iterative maximum likelihood procedure is about $10^5$ times\nlarger for a distance exponent of two (corresponding to the inverse-square law)\ncompared to an exponent of one. When we applied the same technique to this\npulsar dataset with two different values for the trial luminosity function in\nthe zeroth iteration, we find that neither of them can reproduce a value of\n$10^5$ for the ratio of the convergence error between these distance exponents.\nWe then reconstruct the differential pulsar luminosity function using\nLynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method after positing both an inverse-linear and an\ninverse-square scalings with distance.

Nevertheless, all models proposed so far\nhave either only been able to account for a subset of our observations (i.e. at\nz > 2), or they have required fairly extreme conditions to be present within\nthe absorbing material. In this paper, we investigate the absorption of the GRB\nafterglow by a collisionally ionised and turbulent interstellar medium (ISM).\nWe find that a dense (3 per cubic centimeters) collisionally ionised ISM could\nproduce UV/optical and soft X-ray absorbing column densities that differ by a\nfactor of 10, however the UV/optical and soft X-ray absorbing column densities\nfor such sightlines and are 2-3 orders of magnitude lower in comparison to the\nGRB afterglow spectra. For those GRBs with a larger soft X-ray excess of up to\nan order of magnitude, the contribution in absorption from a turbulent ISM as\nconsidered here would ease the required conditions of additional absorbing\ncomponents, such as the GRB circumburst medium and intergalactic medium. \n\n"}

We use the BeppoSAX, Suzaku and RXTE\n(Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer), Suzaku and BeppoSAX observations for this\ninvestigation. We argue that the X-ray broad-band spectra during all spectral\nstates can be adequately reproduced by a model, consisting of a low-temperature\nBlackbody component, two Comptonized components both due to the presence of a\nCompton cloud (CC) that up-scatters seed photons of $T_{s1}$~< 1.4 keV, and\n$T_{s2}<$1 keV, and an iron-line component. We find using this model that the\nphoton power-law index is almost constant, $\\Gamma_{1}\\sim 2$ for all spectral\nstates. However, $\\Gamma_{2}$ shows a behavior depending on the spectral state.\nNamely, $\\Gamma_{2}$ is quasi-constant at the level of $\\Gamma_{2}\\sim 2$ while\nthe CC plasma temperature $kT^{(2)}_e$ is less than 40 keV; on the other hand,\n$\\Gamma_{2}$ is in the range of $1.3<\\Gamma_{2}<2$, when $kT^{(2)}_e$ is\ngreater than 40 keV.

They subsequently condense into a\nDM core close to the center of the star and eventually annihilate. In this\nwork, we trace DM capture and annihilation rates throughout the life of a\nmassive star and show that this evolution culminates in an intense annihilation\nburst coincident with the death of the star in a core collapse supernova. The\nreason is that, along with the stellar interior, also its DM core heats up and\ncontracts, so that the DM density increases rapidly during the final stages of\nstellar evolution. We argue that, counterintuitively, the annihilation burst is\nmore intense if DM annihilation is a $p$-wave process than for $s$-wave\nannihilation because in the former case, more DM particles survive until the\nsupernova. If among the DM annihilation products are particles like dark\nphotons that can escape the exploding star and decay to Standard Model\nparticles later, the annihilation burst results in a flash of gamma rays\naccompanying the supernova.

In this Letter, we investigate whether\npulsar braking by combined between the magnetic dipole emission and the\ngravitational radiation might have a braking index greater than three. For\nconventional neutron star and low mass quark star candidates, the inferred\nellipticities derived by the observed braking index are obviously much larger\nthan the theoretical estimated maximum value.

Due\nto the successful operation of digital radio experiments and due to the\nimproved quantitative understanding of the emission, radio detection is back on\nthe list of promising techniques for extensive air showers. With a threshold of\nabout 100 PeV radio detectors are particularly useful to study the\nhighest-energy galactic cosmic rays and ultra-high-energy extragalactic\nparticles of all types. Various antenna arrays like LOPES, CODALEMA, AERA,\nLOFAR, and Tunka-Rex have shown that radio measurements can compete in\nprecision with other techniques, in particular for the arrival direction, the\nenergy, and the position of the shower maximum. The scientific potential of the\nradio technique seems to be maximum in combination with particle detectors,\nwhich increases the total accuracy for air-shower measurements.

In particular, the LIGO detectors are most sensitive to\nsources above North America and the Indian Ocean and, as the Earth rotates, the\nsensitive regions are swept across the sky. However, because the detectors do\nnot acquire data uniformly over time, there is a net bias on detectable\nsources' right ascensions. Both LIGO detectors preferentially collect data\nduring their local night; it is more than twice as likely to be local midnight\nthan noon when both detectors are operating. We discuss these selection effects\nand how they impact LIGO's observations and electromagnetic follow-up. Beyond\ngalactic foregrounds associated with seasonal variations, we find that\nequatorial observatories can access over $80\\%$ of the localization\nprobability, while mid-latitudes will access closer to $70\\%$.

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are\nused to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of\nthe morphological classes.

Its combination with\nnumerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence allows the\ndiagnosis of the ICM turbulence. Being the ICM plasma weakly collisional, the\nthermal velocity distribution of the particles naturally develops anisotropies\nas a consequence of the large scale motions and the conservation of the\nmagnetic moment of the charged particles.

There is no detectable astrophysical source up to the PeV\nscale, when neutrons coming from supernova remnants may reach the Earth before\ndecaying. In addition, ultra high energy neutrons are the most plausible\nexplanation for the measured anisotropy of cosmic-ray showers produced in the\natmosphere above $10^{18}$ eV. From the GeV to the PeV scale, the expected\nneutron flux is very low and not too different from the antiproton flux, as the\nsame cosmic-ray collisions with the interstellar medium which can produce\nantiprotons can also produce neutrons and antineutrons. This background flux of\ncosmic-ray neutrons is very low and has not yet been detected.

In practice, we provide the\nminimal photon flux necessary for neutrino detection based on two main\nobservables, the bolometric luminosity and the time variability of the\nemission.

As a result of the short-range\ncorrelations, the single-nucleon momentum distribution develops a high-momentum\ntail above the Fermi surface. Because of the strongly isospin-dependent\nshort-range correlations, in neutron-rich matter a higher fraction of protons\nwill be depleted from its Fermi sea and populate above the Fermi surface\ncompared to neutrons.

While the sample is still limited, evidence has been\naccumulating that the final mass-loss rate tends to be larger for a more\nextended progenitor, with the difference exceeding an order of magnitude\nbetween the more and less extended progenitors.

We show that the observational\nrelation in the progenitor radii and mass-loss rates may be a consequence of\nnon-conservative mass transfer in the final phase of progenitor evolution\nwithout fine tuning. Further, we find a possible link between SNe IIb and SNe\nIIn.

Testing the no-hair theorem has\nbeen a longstanding goal of gravitational-wave astronomy. The recent detection\nof gravitational waves from black hole mergers would seem to make such tests\nimminent.

Using data for 24 RRATs, we find that their period\nderivatives are generally larger than those of normal pulsars, independent of\nany intrinsic correlation with period, indicating that RRATs' highly sporadic\nemission may be associated with intrinsically larger magnetic fields. We carry\nout Lomb$-$Scargle tests to search for periodicities in RRATs' pulse detection\ntimes with long timescales.

The end of millions of\nyears of massive star evolution and the beginning of hundreds or thousands of\nyears of supernova evolution are separated by a matter of a few seconds, in\nwhich some of the most extreme physics found in the Universe causes the\nexplosive and terminal disruption of the star.

Our detection rate and the\nmaximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,\nall made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating\ncircular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose\nthat the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength\nsample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.\nCircular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or\nshorter than our median sampling interval <1 month.

Through\na systematic statistical study of data taken from October 2006 (from December\n2009 for the case of the 1.3mm observations) to August 2014, we characterise\nthe variability of the total flux density and linear polarisation.

The total flux-density variability at 1.3mm is found, in general, to\nbe faster, and to have larger amplitude and flatter PSD slopes than 3.5mm. The\npolarisation degree is on average larger at 1.3mm than at 3.5mm, by a factor of\n2.6. The variability of linear polarisation degree is faster and has higher\nfractional amplitude than for total flux density, with the typical time scales\nduring prominent polarisation peaks being significantly faster at 1.3mm than at\n3.5mm. The polarisation angle at both 3.5 and 1.3mm is highly variable.

We present\nthe results of a five-minute observation of a 30x30 sq. deg MWA field at 162\nMHz with 0.5 second time resolution. Of the 2550 continuum sources detected in\nthis field, 302 (12 per cent) show rapid fluctuations caused by IPS. We find\nthat at least 32% of bright low-frequency radio sources contain a sub-arcsec\ncompact component that contributes over 40% of the total flux density. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, peaked-spectrum radio sources are the dominant population among\nthe strongly-scintillating, low-frequency sources in our sample. While\ngamma-ray AGN are generally compact, flat-spectrum radio sources at higher\nfrequencies, the 162 MHz properties of many of the Fermi blazars in our field\nare consistent with a compact component embedded within more extended\nlow-frequency emission.

Since a maximum energy budget\n($\\sim2\\times10^{52}$ erg) exists for magnetars but not for a black hole, this\nprovides a good clue to identify the type of GRB central engine. We calculate\nthe isotropic kinetic energy $E_{\\rm K,iso}$ and the isotropic X-ray energy\nrelease $E_{\\rm X,iso}$ for individual GRB. We identify three categories based\non how likely a black hole harbor at central engine: 'Gold' (9 out of 101, both\n$E_{\\rm X,iso}$ and $E_{\\rm K,iso}$ exceed the energy budget), 'Silver' (69 out\nof 101, $E_{\\rm X,iso}$ less than the limit but $E_{\\rm K,iso}$ is greater than\nthe limit), and 'Bronze' (23 out of 101, the energies are not above the limit).\nWe then derive and test the black hole parameters with the Blandford Znajek\nmechanism, and find that the observations of the black hole candidate\n('Gold'+'Silver') samples are consistent with the expectations of the black\nhole model. Furthermore, we also test the magnetar candidate ('Bronze') sample\nwith the magnetar model, and find that the magnetar surface magnetic led\n($B_{p}$) and initial spin period ($P_{0}$) are consistent with the\nexpectations of the magnetar model.

Although gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been promising\nsources of UHECRs, it is still unclear whether they can account for the Auger\nresults because of their unknown nuclear composition of ejected UHECRs. In this\nwork, we revisit the possibility that low-luminosity GRBs (LL GRBs) act as the\nsources of UHECR nuclei, and give new predictions based on the intrajet nuclear\ncomposition models considering progenitor dependencies. We find that the\nnuclear component in the jet can be divided into two groups according to the\nmass fraction of silicon nuclei, Si-free and Si-rich. Motivated by the\nconnection between LL GRBs and transrelativistic supernovae, we also consider\nthe hypernova ejecta composition. Then, we discuss the survivability of UHECR\nnuclei in the jet base and internal shocks of the jets, and show that it is\neasier for nuclei to survive for typical LL GRBs. Finally, we numerically\npropagate UHECR nuclei ejected from LL GRBs with different composition models\nand compare the resulting spectra and composition to Auger data. Our results\nshow that both the Si-rich progenitor and hypernova ejecta models match the\nAuger data well, while the Si-free progenitor models have more difficulty in\nfitting the spectrum. We argue that our model is consistent with the newly\nreported cross correlation between the UHECRs and starburst galaxies, since\nboth LL GRBs and hypernovae are expected to be tracers of the star-formation\nactivity.

The efficiency of thermal conduction in\nthe intracluster medium (ICM) is complicated by the existence of turbulence and\nmagnetic fields, and has received a lot of attention in the literature.\nPrevious studies suggest that the magnetothermal instability developed in outer\nregions of galaxy clusters would drive magnetic field lines preferentially\nradial, resulting in efficient conduction along the radial direction. Using a\nseries of spherically-symmetric simulations, here we investigate the impact of\nthermal conduction on the observed temperature distributions in outer regions\nof three massive clusters, and find that thermal conduction substantially\nmodifies the ICM temperature profile. Within 3 Gyr, the gas temperature at a\nrepresentative radius of $0.3r_{500}$ typically decreases by ~10 - 20% and the\naverage temperature slope between $0.3r_{500}$ and $r_{500}$ drops by ~ 30 -\n40%, indicating that the observed ICM would not stay in a long-term equilibrium\nstate in the presence of thermal conduction.

Yet, nobody has ever seen a black\nhole. What do they look like? Initially, this question seemed more of an\nacademic nature. However, this has changed over the past two decades.\nObservations and theoretical considerations suggest that the supermassive black\nhole, Sgr A*, in the center of our Milky Way is surrounded by a compact, foggy\nemission region radiating at and above 230 GHz. It has been predicted that the\nevent horizon of Sgr A* should cast its shadow onto that emission region, which\ncould be detectable with a global VLBI array of radio telescopes. In contrast\nto earlier pictures of black holes, that dark feature is not supposed to be due\nto a hole in the accretion flow, but would represent a true negative image of\nthe event horizon. Currently, the global Event Horizon Telescope consortium is\nattempting to make such an image. In the future those images could be improved\nby adding more telescopes to the array, in particular at high sites in Africa.\nUltimately, a space array at THz frequencies, the Event Horizon Imager, could\nproduce much more detailed images of black holes.

In different empirical extinction laws, the\ntotal-to-selective extinction, RV, is an important quantity because of its\nrelation to dust grain sizes and compositions. We here analyse a sample of 17\nGRBs (0.34<z<7.84) where the ultraviolet to near-infrared spectroscopic\nobservations are available through the VLT/X-shooter instrument, giving us an\nopportunity to fit individual extinction curves of GRBs for the first time.

The X-shooter data are combined with the Swift\nX-ray data and a single or broken power-law together with a parametric\nextinction law is used to model the individual SEDs. We find 10 cases with\nsignificant dust, where the derived extinction, AV, ranges from 0.1-1.0mag. In\nfour of those, the inferred extinction curves are consistent with the SMC\ncurve. The GRB individual extinction curves have a flat RV distribution with an\noptimal weighted combined value of RV = 2.61+/-0.08 (for seven broad coverage\ncases).

The tidal disruption of stellar binaries by a massive BH is\nknown to produce hypervelocity stars. However, such a tidal encounter does not\nalways lead to the break-up of binaries. Since surviving binaries tend to\nbecome hard and eccentric, this process can produce BH mergers in principle.\nFor initially circular binaries, we show that the gravitational wave (GW)\nmerger times become shorter by a factor of more than $10^{2}$ ($10^5$) in\n$10\\%$ ($1\\%$) of the surviving cases. This reduction is primarily due to the\ngrowth in binary's eccentricity at the tidal encounter. We also investigate the\neffective spins of the survivors, assuming that BH spins are initially aligned\nwith the binary orbital angular momentum. We find that binary orientations can\nflip in the opposite direction at the tidal encounter. For the survivors with\nlarge merger time reduction factors, the effective spin distribution is rather\nflat. We estimate the merger rate due to the tidal encounter channel to be\n$\\sim 0.6\\ \\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$.

In our analysis, we use\na background-independent method to search for point-like sources based on a\nwavelet transform implemented in the PGWave code. The 1FLE contains 198 sources\ndetected above 3 $\\sigma$ significance with eight years and nine months of the\nFermi-LAT data. For 187 sources in the 1FLE catalog we have found an\nassociation in the Fermi-LAT 3FGL catalog: 148 are extragalactic, 22 are\nGalactic, and 17 are unclassified in the 3FGL. The ratio of the number of flat\nspectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) to BL Lacertae (BL Lacs) in 1FLE is 3 to 1, which\ncan be compared with an approximately 1 to 1 ratio for the 3FGL or a 1 to 6\nratio for 3FHL. The higher ratio of the FSRQs in the 1FLE is expected due to\ngenerally softer spectra of FSRQs relative to BL Lacs. Most BL Lacs in 1FLE are\nof low-synchrotron peaked blazar type (18 out of 31), which have softer spectra\nand higher redshifts than BL Lacs on average. Correspondingly, we find that the\naverage redshift of the BL Lacs in 1FLE is higher than in 3FGL or 3FHL. There\nare 11 sources that do not have associations in the 3FGL. Most of the\nunassociated sources either come from regions of bright diffuse emission or\nhave several known 3FGL sources in the vicinity, which can lead to source\nconfusion.

Polarimetry, a\npowerful diagnostic tool for probing the geometry and emission processes of\nunresolved sources, was obtained for this event. The observed linear\npolarization was consistent with being mostly induced by intervening dust,\nsuggesting that the intrinsic emission was weakly polarized ($P < 0.4-0.5$ %).\nIn this paper, we present and discuss a detailed analysis of the linear\npolarization expected from a merging NS binary system by means of 3D Monte\nCarlo radiative transfer simulations assuming a range of possible\nconfigurations, wavelengths, epochs and viewing angles.

The flaring behavior is\nrecurrent for at least two sources. If the flare represents a short period of\naccretion onto an IMBH during the periastron passage of a donor star on an\neccentric (i.e., repeating) or parabolic (non-repeating) orbit, we argue that\nthe flare's rise time corresponds to the duration during which the donor's\ntidally stripped mass joins a residual disk at the pericenter. This duration is\nin turn equal to three other time scales: the duration of stripping, the sound\ncrossing time of the donor, and the circular orbit time at the pericenter\nradius. Only a white dwarf can have a sound crossing time as short as one\nminute. Therefore, the donor must be a white dwarf and it was stripped of\n~10^{-10} M_sun upon each passage at several to tens of Schwarzschild radii\nfrom the IMBH.

Two processes that are commonly considered (e.g., for sub-grid\nprescriptions) are Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion and the Eddington limit. A\nthird one is AGN wind feedback. It has been long suggested that such a wind\nfeedback regulates the final SMBH mass, however, it has been shown recently\nthat AGN winds can also regulate the average accretion rate at a level\nconsistent with observations of high redshift AGNs. In this paper we study the\neffect of wind feedback on the accretion rate using 2D, high resolution\nhydrodynamic simulations, that incorporate a self-consistent wind injection\nscheme and resolves the SMBH sphere of influence. Two different cases are\nexplored and compared: one in which the initial gas density is uniform, and one\nin which it has an isothermal sphere profile. We also compare simulations with\nand without cooling. Our main finding is that for reasonable parameters, AGN\nfeedback always limits the accretion rate to be far below the\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton limit. For typical wind parameters and a uniform ISM\ndensities of the order $1 {cm}^{-3}$, the accretion rate is found to be several\norders of magnitudes smaller than that inferred in large samples of high\nredshift AGNs. On the other hand, the accretion rate obtained for initially\nisothermal density profile is found to be consistent with the observations,\nparticularly when cooling is included.

These galaxies display large-scale remnant radio plasma in the\nintergalactic medium left behind by a past episode of active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) activity, and meanwhile, the radio jets have restarted in a new episode.\nThe knowledge of what causes the jets to switch off and restart is crucial to\nour understanding of galaxy evolution, while it is important to know if DDRGs\nform a host galaxy dichotomy relative to RLAGN. We utilised the LOFAR Two-Metre\nSky Survey DR1, using a visual identification method to compile a sample of\nmorphologically selected candidate DDRGs, showing two pairs of radio lobes. To\nconfirm the restarted nature in each of the candidate sources, we obtained\nfollow-up observations with the VLA at higher resolution to observe the inner\nlobes or restarted jets, the confirmation of which created a robust sample of\n33 DDRGs. We created a comparison sample of 777 RLAGN from the DR1 catalogue,\nand compared the optical and infrared magnitudes and colours of their host\ngalaxies.

This paper\nproposes a new method for one facet of this problem, that of template profile\ngeneration, and demonstrates it on the well-timed millisecond pulsar\nJ1713+0747.

We developed a generic formalism (Bera {\\em et al.}, 2016) to estimate\nthe FRB detection rate for any radio telescope with given parameters. By using\nthis model, we estimated the FRB detection rate for two Indian radio telescope;\nthe Ooty Wide Field Array (OWFA) (Bhattacharyya {\\em et al.}, 2017) and the\nupgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) (Bhattacharyya {\\em et al.},\n2018) with three beam forming modes. In this review article, I summarize these\ntwo works. We considered the energy spectrum of FRBs as a power law and the\nenergy distribution of FRBs as a Dirac delta function and a Schechter\nluminosity function. We also considered two scattering models proposed by Bhat\n{\\em et al.} (2004) and Macquart \\& Koay (2013) for these work and I consider\nFRB pulse without scattering as a special case for this review. We found that\nthe future prospects of detecting FRBs by using these two Indian radio\ntelescopes is good. They are capable to detect a significant number of FRBs per\nday. According to our prediction, we can detect $\\sim 10^5-10^8$, $\\sim\n10^3-10^6$ and $\\sim 10^5-10^7$ FRBs per day by using OWFA, commensal systems\nof GMRT and uGMRT respectively. Even a non detection of the predicted events\nwill be very useful in constraining FRB properties. \n\n"}
{"id": "1812.10403", "contents": "Title: Transfer Learning in Astronomy: A New Machine-Learning Paradigm Abstract: The widespread dissemination of machine learning tools in science,\nparticularly in astronomy, has revealed the limitation of working with simple\nsingle-task scenarios in which any task in need of a predictive model is looked\nin isolation, and ignores the existence of other similar tasks. In contrast, a\nnew generation of techniques is emerging where predictive models can take\nadvantage of previous experience to leverage information from similar tasks.\nThe new emerging area is referred to as transfer learning. In this paper, I\nbriefly describe the motivation behind the use of transfer learning techniques,\nand explain how such techniques can be used to solve popular problems in\nastronomy. As an example, a prevalent problem in astronomy is to estimate the\nclass of an object (e.g., Supernova Ia) using a generation of photometric\nlight-curve datasets where data abounds, but class labels are scarce; such\nanalysis can benefit from spectroscopic data where class labels are known with\nhigh confidence, but the data sample is small. Transfer learning provides a\nrobust and practical solution to leverage information from one domain to\nimprove the accuracy of a model built on a different domain. In the example\nabove, transfer learning would look to overcome the difficulty in the\ncompatibility of models between spectroscopic data and photometric data, since\ndata properties such as size, class priors, and underlying distributions, are\nall expected to be significantly different. \n\n"}

{"id": "1901.01284", "contents": "Title: Cosmic Ray Spectrum Steepening in Supernova Remnants -- I. Loss-Free\n  Self-Similar Solution Abstract: The direct measurements of cosmic rays (CRs), after correction for the\npropagation effects in the interstellar medium, indicate that their source\nspectra are likely to be significantly steeper than the canonical $E^{-2}$\nspectrum predicted by the standard Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA)\nmechanism. The DSA has long been held responsible for the production of\ngalactic CRs in supernova remnant (SNR) shocks. The $\\gamma$-ray 'probes' of\nthe acceleration spectra of CRs on-the-spot, inside of the SNRs, lead to the\nsame conclusion. We show that the steep acceleration spectrum can be attributed\nto the $combination$ of (i) spherical expansion, (ii) tilting of the magnetic\nfield along the shock surface and (iii) shock deceleration. Because of (i) and\n(ii), the DSA is efficient only on two ``polar caps'' of a spherical shock\nwhere the local magnetic field is within $\\simeq45^{\\circ}$ to its normal. The\nshock-produced spectrum observed edge-on steepens with the particle energy\nbecause the number of freshly accelerated particles with lower energies\ncontinually adds up to a growing acceleration region. We demonstrate the\nsteepening effect by obtaining an exact self-similar solution for the particle\nacceleration at expanding shock surface with an arbitrary energy dependence of\nparticle diffusivity $\\kappa$. We show that its increase toward higher energy\nsteepens the spectrum, which deeply contrasts with the standard DSA spectrum\nwhere $\\kappa$ cancels out. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.02962", "contents": "Title: CLOUDY view of the warm corona Abstract: Bright active galaxies show a range of properties but many of these\nproperties are correlated which has led to the concept of the Quasar Main\nSequence. We test whether our current understanding of the quasar structure\nallows to reproduce the pattern observed in the optical plane formed by the\nkinematic line width of H$\\beta$ and the relative importance of the Fe II\noptical emission. We performed simulations of the H$\\beta$ and Fe II production\nusing the code CLOUDY and well justified assumptions about the broad band\nspectra, distance of the emission line region, and the cloud properties. We\nshow that the presence of the warm corona is an important element of the broad\nband spectrum which decreases the dependence of the relative Fe II emissivity\non the Eddington ratio, and allows to reproduce the rare cases of the\nparticularly strong Fe II emitters. Results are sensitive to the adopted cloud\ndistance, and strong Fe II emission can be obtain either by adopting strongly\nsuper-solar metallicity, or much shorter distance than traditionally obtained\nfrom reverberation mapping. We modeled in a similar way the UV plane defined by\nthe Mg II line and Fe II UV pseudo-continuum, but here our approach is less\nsuccessful, in general overproducing the Fe II strength. We found that the Fe\nII optical and UV emissivity depend in a different way on the turbulent\nvelocity and metallicity, and the best extension of the model in order to cover\nboth planes is to allow very large turbulent velocities in the Broad Line\nRegion clouds. \n\n"}

The\nfirst ever gravitational-wave detection from the coalescence of two neutron\nstars, GW170817, and its gamma-ray counterpart, GRB 170817A, led to an\nelectromagnetic follow-up of the event at an unprecedented scale. Several teams\nfrom across the world searched for EM/neutrino counterparts to GW170817, paving\nthe way for the discovery of optical, X-ray, and radio counterparts. In this\narticle, we describe the online identification of gravitational-wave transients\nand the distribution of gravitational-wave alerts by the LIGO and Virgo\ncollaborations during O2. We also describe the gravitational-wave observables\nwhich were sent in the alerts to enable searches for their counterparts.\nFinally, we give an overview of the online candidate alerts shared with\nobserving partners during O2. Alerts were issued for 14 candidates, six of\nwhich have been confirmed as gravitational-wave events associated with the\nmerger of black holes or neutron stars.
