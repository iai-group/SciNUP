A combinatorial model for this, the mapping\nclass groupoid, arises from the invariant cell decomposition of Teichm\\\"uller\nspace, whose fundamental path groupoid is called the Ptolemy groupoid.

The axioms on the data are contained in the\nfollowing assumptions. It is assumed the punctures are labeled and divided into\nnonempty sets of inputs and outputs. The inputs are marked by a tangent\ndirection and the outputs are weighted by nonnegative real numbers adding to\nunity. It is assumed the gluing of inputs to outputs lands on the\npseudomanifold boundary of the cell decomposition and the entire pseudomanifold\nboundary is decomposed into pieces by all such factorings. It is further\nassumed that the action is equivariant with respect to the toroidal action of\nrotating the markings.

Our goal is to understand an\nopen part of L_K(M) as a Lagrangian in the symplectic space of framed flat\nconnections on the boundary, and as a K_2-Lagrangian, meaning that the\nK_2-avatar of the symplectic form restricts to zero.

If R is the fundamental representation R=[1], then M_{[1] Q} is\nequal to the number of paths in representation graph, which lead from the\nfundamental vertex [1] to the vertex Q. In the basis of paths the entries of\nthe m-1 relevant R-matrices are associated with the pairs of paths and are\nnon-vanishing only when the two paths either coincide or differ by at most one\nvertex; as a corollary R-matrices consist of just 1x1 and 2x2 blocks, given by\nvery simple explicit expressions.

In the second part, we identify the following three objects:\nthe Seiberg-Witten invariant of a plumbed 3-manifold, the periodic constant of\nits topological Poincare series, and a coefficient of an equivariant\nmultivariable Ehrhart polynomial. For this, we construct the corresponding\npolytope from the plumbing graph, together with an action of H_1(M,\\Z), and we\ndevelop Ehrhart theory for them. The effect of the reduction appears also at\nthe level of the multivariable topological Poincare series, simplifying the\ncorresponding polytope and the Ehrhart theory as well.

The method is expected to give a reason \"why 4 colours suffice\"\nand suggests that every two dimensional geometric graph of arbitrary degree and\norientation can be coloured by 5 colours: since the projective plane can not be\na boundary of a 3-dimensional graph and because for higher genus surfaces, the\ninterior H is not simply connected, we need in general to embed a surface into\na 4-dimensional simply connected graph in order to colour it. This explains the\nappearance of the chromatic number 5 for higher degree or non-orientable\nsituations, a number we believe to be the upper limit. For every surface type,\nwe construct examples with chromatic number 3,4 or 5, where the construction of\nsurfaces with chromatic number 5 is based on a method of Fisk. We have\nimplemented and illustrated all the topological aspects described in this paper\non a computer. So far we still need human guidance or simulated annealing to do\nthe refinements in the higher dimensional host graph. \n\n"}

The basic concept is still\nthat of a line segment but its equivalent notion of betweenness is viewed as a\ntopological, not a metric concept. That leads quickly to the notion of\nconnectedness without any need to dwell on the definition of topology. In our\napproach line segments must be connected. Lines and planes are unified via the\nconcept of separation: lines are separated into two components by each point,\nplanes contain lines that separate them into two components as well. We add a\nsubgroup of bijections preserving line segments and establishing unique\nisomorphism of basic geometrical sets, and the axiomatic structure is complete.\nOf fundamental importance is the Fixed Point Theorem that allows for creation\nof the concepts of length and congruency of line segments. The resulting\nstructure is much more in sync with modern science than other axiomatic\napproaches to planar geometry. For instance, it leads naturally to the Erlangen\nProgram in geometry. Our Conditions of Homogeneity and Rigidity have two\ninterpretations. In physics, they correspond to the basic tenet that\nindependent observers should arrive at the same measurement and are related to\nboosts in special relativity.

This vanishing happens for any value of q (even\nwhen q is not a root of unity). These properties make it difficult to create a\nfusion or modular category. Loosely speaking, the standard way to obtain such a\ncategory from a quantum group is: 1) specialize q to a root of unity; this\nforces some modules to have zero quantum dimension, 2) quotient by morphisms of\nmodules with zero quantum dimension, 3) show the resulting category is finite\nand semi-simple.

This circle is intimately bound up\nwith the extrinsic geometry of the leaves of F. In particular, for any pair of\nleaves m,l of the universal cover of F with m>l, the leaf l is asymptotic to m\nin a dense set of directions at infinity, where the leaf space is co-oriented\nso that the foliation branches in the negative direction.

Here this example is shown to be distinct from the same\nsphere with the reversed orientation.\n  To demonstrate this fact a state-sum invariant for classical knots and\nknotted surfaces is developed via a cohomology theory of racks and quandles\n(also known as distributive groupoids).\n  A quandle is a set with a binary operation --- the axioms of which model the\nReidemeister moves in the classical theory of knotted and linked curves in\n3-space. Colorings of diagrams of knotted curves and surfaces by quandle\nelements, together with cocycles of quandles, are used to define state-sum\ninvariants for knotted circles in 3-space and knotted surfaces in 4-space.\n  Cohomology groups of various quandles are computed herein and applied to the\nstudy of the state-sum invariants of classical knots and links and other linked\nsurfaces. Non-triviality of the invariants are proved for variety of knots and\nlinks, including the trefoil and figure-eight knots, and conversely, knot\ninvariants are used to prove non-triviality of cohomology for a variety of\nquandles. \n\n"}

This method is currently feasible for the evaluation of LG for\nlinks for which we have a braid presentation of string index at most 5. Data\nare presented for the invariant, for all prime knots of up to 10 crossings and\nvarious other links. LG distinguishes between these links, and also detects the\nchirality of those that are chiral. In this sense, it is more sensitive than\nthe well-known two-variable HOMFLY and Kauffman polynomials. When applied to\nexamples which defeat the HOMFLY invariant, interestingly, LG `almost' fails.\nThe automatic method is in fact applicable to the evaluation of any such state\nsum invariant for which an appropriate R matrix and cap and cup matrices have\nbeen determined. \n\n"}

{"id": "math/9909063", "contents": "Title: The Links-Gould Invariant Abstract: The ``Links-Gould invariant'' is a two-variable Laurent polynomial invariant\nof oriented (1,1) tangles, which is derived from the representation of the\nbraid generator associated with the one-parameter family of four dimensional\nrepresentations with highest weights (0,0|a) of the quantum superalgebra\nU_q[gl(2|1)]. We use an abstract tensor state model to evaluate the invariant,\nas per the construction of the bracket polynomial state model used by Louis\nKauffman to derive the Jones polynomial. This model facilitates both\ncomputation and theoretical exploration.\n  Our family of representations has a two-variable quantum R matrix (unique up\nto orthogonal transformations). Choosing this R matrix to yield the\nrepresentation of the braid generator ensures that our polynomial invariant\nwill also have two variables. We construct this R matrix from first principles.\nWe have evaluated the invariant for several critical link examples and numerous\nother links of special forms. Throughout, the assistance of Mathematica has\nbeen invoked.\n  We observe that the Links-Gould invariant is distinct from the two-variable\nHOMFLY polynomial in that it detects the chirality of some links where the\nHOMFLY fails. Notably, it does not distinguish inverses, which is not\nsurprising as we are able to demonstrate that no invariant of this type should\nbe able to distinguish between inverses.
