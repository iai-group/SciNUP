Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

As a first\napplication, we estimate the impact of non-radial effects on excitation rates\nand amplitudes of high-angular-degree modes which are observed on the Sun. A\nmodel of stochastic excitation by turbulent convection has been developed to\ncompute the excitation rates, and it has been successfully applied to solar\nradial modes (Samadi & Goupil 2001, Belkacem et al. 2006b).

Qualitative arguments as\nwell as numerical calculations are used to illustrate the results.

The inner\nregions of accretion disks around neutron stars can harbor very high frequency\nmodes related to the radial epicyclic frequency $\\kappa $. The degeneracy of\n$\\kappa $ with the orbital frequency $\\Omega $ is removed in a non-Keplerian\nboundary or transition zone near the magnetopause between the disk and the\ncompact object.

Transient Be/X-ray binaries exhibit two branches in their colour-colour\nand colour-intensity diagrams: the horizontal branch corresponds to a\nlow-intensity state and shows the larger fractional rms, similar to the the\nisland state in atolls and horizontal branch in Z sources; the diagonal branch\ncorresponds to a high-intensity state, in which the source spends about 75% of\nthe total duration of the outburst.

By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show that such discs fragment within a few thousand years, and\nproduce mainlybrown dwarf (BDs) stars, but also planetary mass (PM) stars and\nvery low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a\nfew Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these\ndiscs if they remain bound to the primary star.

We find four dubious cosmic string candidates in 318\nsingle filter guest observer images (1.08 square degrees), which we are unable\nto conclusively eliminate with existing data. The confirmation of any one of\nthese candidates as cosmic strings would imply G mu/c^2 ~ 10^-6 and Omega_s ~\n10^-5. However, we estimate that there is at least a 92% chance that these\nstring candidates are random alignments of galaxies.

Effect of\n  uniform rotation Abstract: We focus on the influence of the Coriolis acceleration on the stochastic\nexcitation of oscillation modes in convective regions of rotating stars. Our\naim is to estimate the asymmetry between excitation rates of prograde and\nretrograde modes. We extend the formalism derived for obtaining stellar $p$-\nand $g$-mode amplitudes (Samadi & Goupil 2001, Belkacem et al. 2008) to include\nthe effect of the Coriolis acceleration. We then study the special case of\nuniform rotation for slowly rotating stars by performing a perturbative\nanalysis. This allows us to consider the cases of the Sun and the CoRoT target\nHD 49933. We find that, in the subsonic regime, the influence of rotation as a\ndirect contribution to mode driving is negligible in front of the Reynolds\nstress contribution. In slow rotators, the indirect effect of the modification\nof the eigenfunctions on mode excitation is investigated by performing a\nperturbative analysis of the excitation rates. It turns out that the excitation\nof solar $p$ modes is affected by rotation with excitation rates asymmetries\nbetween prograde and retrograde modes of the order of several percents. Solar\nlow-order $g$ modes are also affected by uniform rotation and their excitation\nrates asymmetries are found to reach up to 10 %.

However, for the lower\nluminosity 0.1L*(z=3) galaxies, we measure a mean beta of -3.0+/-0.2. This is\nsubstantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z~4, just\n800 Myr later, and even at z~5-6.

The bulge and thick disks of modern\ngalaxies may form this way. Simulations of minor mergers make thick disks too,\nbut there is an important difference. Thick disks made by internal processes\nhave a constant scale height with galactocentric radius, but thick disks made\nby mergers flare. The difference arises because in the first case,\nperpendicular forcing and disk-gravity resistance are both proportional to the\ndisk column density, so the resulting scale height is independent of this\ndensity. In the case of mergers, perpendicular forcing is independent of the\ncolumn density and the low density regions get thicker; the resulting flaring\nis inconsistent with observations. Late-stage gas accretion and thin disk\ngrowth are shown to preserve the constant scale heights of thick disks formed\nby internal evolution.

As a step towards that goal, I broaden the Strong\nEquivalence Principle to a new principle of physics, the Cosmological\nEquivalence Principle, to account for the role of the evolving average regional\ndensity of the universe in the synchronisation of clocks and the relative\ncalibration of inertial frames. In a universe dominated by voids of the size\nobserved in large-scale structure surveys, the density contrasts of expanding\nregions are strong enough that a relative deceleration of the background\nbetween voids and the environment of galaxies, typically of order 10^{-10}\nm/s^2, must be accounted for. As a result one finds a universe whose present\nage varies by billions of years according to the position of the observer: a\ntimescape. This model universe is observationally viable: it passes three\ncritical independent tests, and makes additional predictions. Dark energy is\nrevealed as a mis-identification of gravitational energy gradients and the\nresulting variance in clock rates. Understanding the biggest mystery in\ncosmology therefore involves a paradigm shift, but in an unexpected direction:\nthe conceptual understanding of time and energy in Einstein's own theory is\nincomplete. \n\n"}

With the dozen bursts detected in the\n0.1-30 GeV band so far, we start to see some common properties: (i) the\nduration is often longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by\nthe Gamma Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi; (ii) the spectrum is consistent\nwith F(v)~v^{-1} with no strong spectral evolution; (iii) for the brightest\nbursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power law with a typical\nslope: t^{-1.5}; iv) the peak energy of the GBM emission exceeds 500 keV (rest\nframe). These properties suggest a similar process for the origin of the GeV\nflux. We propose that it is afterglow synchrotron emission shortly following\nthe start of the prompt phase.

A single image of a planet, however, does not\nprovide evidence that the planet is Earth mass or that it is in a habitable\nzone orbit. The planet's orbit, however, can be measured either by imaging the\nplanet at multiple epochs or by measuring the position of the star at multiple\nepochs by space-based astrometry. The measurement of an exo-planet's orbit by\ndirect imaging is complicated by a number of factors: (1) the inner working\nangle (IWA); (2) the apparent brightness of the planet depending on the orbital\nphase; (3) confusion arising from the presence of multiple planets; and (4) the\nplanet-star contrast.

A simple linear dependence on metallicity of this total mass\nlost explains well the median colours of HB stars.

The most likely candidate is the He\nabundance, which might be different in GCs stars belonging to the different\nstellar generations whose presence was previously derived from the Na-O and\nMg-Al anticorrelations. Variations in the median He abundance allow explaining\nthe extremely blue HB of some GCs; such variations are correlated with the\nR-parameter.

Orientation of the bow shock\nsuggests that BI 237 was ejected from the OB association LH 82 (located at ~120\npc in projection from the star). A by-product of our search is the detection of\nbow shocks generated by four OB stars in the field of the LMC and an arc-like\nstructure attached to the candidate luminous blue variable R81 (HD 269128). The\ngeometry of two of these bow shocks is consistent with the possibility that\ntheir associated stars were ejected from the 30 Doradus star forming complex. \n\n"}

To this\nend, we present here the results of an observational campaign devoted to the\nstudy of the high-z GRB 090205. We carried out optical/NIR spectroscopy and\nimaging of GRB 090205 with the ESO-VLT starting from hours after the event up\nto several days later to detect the host galaxy. We compared the results\nobtained from our optical/NIR observations with the available Swift high-energy\ndata of this burst. Our observational campaign led to the detection of the\noptical afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 090205 and to the first measure of its\nredshift, z=4.65. Similar to other, recent high-z GRBs, GRB 090205 has a short\nduration in the rest-frame with T_{90,rf}=1.6 s, which suggests the possibility\nthat it might belong to the short GRBs class. The X-ray afterglow of GRB 090205\nshows a complex and interesting behaviour with a possible rebrightening at\n500-1000s from the trigger time and late flaring activity. Photometric\nobservations of the GRB 090205 host galaxy argue in favor of a starburst galaxy\nwith a stellar population younger than ~ 150 Myr. Moreover, the metallicity of\nZ > 0.27 Z_Sun derived from the GRB afterglow spectrum is among the highest\nderived from GRB afterglow measurement at high-z, suggesting that the burst\noccurred in a rather enriched envirorment. Finally, a detailed analysis of the\nafterglow spectrum shows the existence of a line corresponding to Lyman-alpha\nemission at the redshift of the burst. GRB 090205 is thus hosted in a typical\nLyman-alpha emitter (LAE) at z=4.65. This makes the GRB 090205 host the\nfarthest GRB host galaxy, spectroscopically confirmed, detected to date. \n\n"}

We analyze the MF\nof different morphological types (ellipticals, S0s and late-types), and find\nthat also each of them evolves with redshift. All types have proportionally\nmore massive galaxies at high- than at low-z, and the strongest evolution\noccurs among S0 galaxies. Examining the morphology-mass relation (the way the\nproportion of galaxies of different morphological types changes with galaxy\nmass), we find it strongly depends on redshift. At both redshifts, ~40% of the\nstellar mass is in elliptical galaxies. Another ~43% of the mass is in S0\ngalaxies in local clusters, while it is in spirals in distant clusters.

Quiescent loops and their confined plasma are considered, and\ntherefore topics such as loop oscillations and flaring loops (except for\nnon-solar ones which provide information on stellar loops) are not specifically\naddressed here. The observational section discusses loop classification and\npopulations, and then describes the morphology of coronal loops, its\nrelationship with the magnetic field, and the concept of loops as\nmulti-stranded structures.

II.\n  Metallicity Abstract: We investigate the large-scale influence of outflows from AGNs in enriching\nthe IGM with metals in a cosmological context. We combine cosmological\nsimulations of large scale structure formation with a detailed model of metal\nenrichment, in which outflows expand anisotropically along the direction of\nleast resistance, distributing metals into the IGM. The metals carried by the\noutflows are generated by two separate stellar populations: stars located near\nthe central AGN, and stars located in the greater galaxy. Using this algorithm,\nwe performed a series of 5 simulations of the propagation of AGN-driven\noutflows in a cosmological volume of size (128/h Mpc)^3 in a Lambda-CDM\nuniverse, and analyze the resulting metal enrichment of the IGM. We found that\nthe metallicity induced in the IGM is greatly dominated by AGNs having\nbolometric luminosity L > 10^9 L_sun, sources with 10^8 < L / L_sun < 10^9\nhaving a negligible contribution. Our simulations produced an average IGM\nmetallicity of [O/H] = -5 at z = 5.5, which then rises gradually, and remains\nrelatively flat at a value [O/H] = -2.8 between z = 2 and z = 0.

If we can consider the entanglement entropy as thermodynamic entropy, we\ncan see the entropic force acting on the two black holes from the $r$\ndependence of $S_C$. We develop the computational method based on that of\nBombelli et al to obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$ of scalar fields whose\nLagrangian is quadratic with respect to the scalar fields. First we study $S_C$\nin $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In this case the state of the\nmassless free scalar field is the Minkowski vacuum state and we replace two\nblack holes by two imaginary spheres, and we take the trace over the degrees of\nfreedom residing in the imaginary spheres. We obtain the leading term of $S_C$\nwith respect to $1/r$. The result is $S_C=S_A+S_B+\\tfrac{1}{r^{2d-2}}\nG(R_1,R_2)$, where $S_A$ and $S_B$ are the entanglement entropy on the inside\nregion of $A$ and $B$, and $G(R_1,R_2) \\leq 0$. We do not calculate\n$G(R_1,R_2)$ in detail, but we show how to calculate it. In the black hole case\nwe use the method used in the Minkowski spacetime case with some modifications.\nWe show that $S_C$ can be expected to be the same form as that in the Minkowski\nspacetime case. But in the black hole case, $S_A$ and $S_B$ depend on $r$, so\nwe do not fully obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$. Finally we assume that the\nentanglement entropy can be regarded as thermodynamic entropy, and consider the\nentropic force acting on two black holes. We argue how to separate the\nentanglement entropic force from other force and how to cancel $S_A$ and $S_B$\nwhose $r$ dependence are not obtained.

It is\ngenerally believed that for extreme mass ratios eta<<1, the scaling of the\nrecoil velocity is V {\\propto} eta^2, where the proportionality coefficient\ndepends on the spin of the larger hole and the geometry of the system (e.g.\norbital inclination).

During our monitoring, an initial period of quiescence was\nfollowed by increased activity which culminated in a radio flare. In the\ntransition period the accretion disc of SS433 became visible in H-alpha and HeI\nemission lines and remained so until the observations were terminated; the\nline-of-sight velocity of the centre of the disc lines during this time behaved\nas though the binary orbit has significant eccentricity rather than being\ncircular, consistent with three recent lines of evidence. After the accretion\ndisc appeared its rotation speed increased steadily from 500 to 700 km/s. The\nlaunch speed of the jets first decreased then suddenly increased. At the same\ntime as the jet launch speed increased, the wind from the accretion disc\ndoubled in speed. Two days afterwards, the radio flux exhibited a flare.

It is based on kinematics of particles moving near the horizon. This\neffect arises when particles of two kinds collide near the horizon. For massive\nparticles, the first kind represents a particle with the generic energy and\nangular momentum (I call them \"usual\"). Near the horizon, such a particle has a\nvelocity almost equal to that of light in the frame that corotates with a black\nhole (the frame is static if a black hole is static). The second kind (called\n\"critical\") consists of particles with the velocity v<c near the horizon due to\nspecial relationship between the energy and angular momentum (or charge). As a\nresult, the relative velocity approaches the speed of light c, the Lorentz\nfactor grows unbound. This explanation applies both to generic rotating black\nholes and charged ones (even for radial motion of particles). If one of\ncolliding particles is massless (photon), the critical particle is\ndistinguished by the fact that its frequency is finite near the horizon. The\nexistence (or absence) of the effect is determined depending on competition of\ntwo factors - gravitational blue shift for a photon propagating towards a black\nhole and the Doppler effect due to transformation from the locally nonrotating\nframe to a comoving one. Classification of all possible types of collisions is\nsuggested depending on whether massive or massless particle is critical or\nusual. \n\n"}

Frequency maps identify important major orbit families, and the\norbital abundances reflect the shape and orientation of the dark matter halo\nrelative to the disk.

Although the shape of the simulated\nhalo varies with radius, frequency maps of local samples of halo orbits\nconfined to the inner halo contain most of the information about the global\nshape of the halo and its major orbit families. Quiescent or adiabatic disk\nformation results in significant trapping of halo orbits in resonant orbit\nfamilies (i.e. orbits with commensurable frequencies). If a good estimate of\nthe Galactic potential in the inner halo (within ~50kpc) is available, the\nappearance of strong, stable resonances in frequency maps of halo orbits will\nallow us to determine the degree of resonant trapping induced by the disk\npotential.

We assume an analytic reionization model and an\nionization fraction with $f_{\\rm NL}$ induced scale dependent bias.

In\norder to evaluate the detectability, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for only a\nsingle redshift slice is also calculated for current and future observations,\nsuch as CMB observations by Planck satellite and 21 cm observations by\nOmniscope. The existence of the $f_{\\rm NL}$ increases the signal of the\ncross-correlation at large scales and the amplification does not depend on the\nreionization parameters in our reionization model. However the cosmic variance\nis significant on such scales and the S/N ratio is suppressed. The obtained S/N\nratio is 2.8 (2.4) for $f_{\\rm NL}=10$ (100) in our fiducial reionization\nmodel.

We consider the formation of molecular cloud by\naccretion of the HI clouds as suggested in recent observations. The simulation\nshows that the initial HI medium is compressed and piled up behind the shock\nwaves induced by the accretion flows. Since the initial medium is highly\ninhomogeneous as a consequence of the thermal instability, the formed molecular\ncloud becomes very turbulent owing to the development of the Richtmyer-Meshkov\ninstability. The structure of the post shock region is composed of dense cold\ngas (T<100 K) and diffuse warm gas (T>1,000 K), which are spatially well mixed\nowing to the turbulence. Because the energy source of the turbulence is the\naccretion flows, the turbulence is highly anisotropic biased toward the\ndirection of accretion flows. The kinetic energy of the turbulence dominates\nthe thermal, magnetic, and gravitational energies in the total 10 Myr\nevolution. However, the kinetic energy measured by using the\nCO-fraction-weighted density is comparable to the other energies.

Use of this relation enables constraints\nto be put on the value of the tidal dissipation, constraints that will be\nimproved as the distribution of the ages are determined. For the giant planets,\nthis leads to an unexpectedly low value of tidal dissipation. This\nover-abundance of short period giant planets may be due to a continuing\nresupply of longer period giant planets migrating into a shorter period pileup,\ndisrupting the presence of smaller planets along the way. Perhaps the\noccurrence distribution of close Neptune sized planets will better measure the\ntidal friction, while the distribution of Jupiter sized planets reveals that\ngiant planets are more likely to complete a gradual migration into the star. \n\n"}

Recent hydrodynamic simulations of\naccretion of solar material onto white dwarfs without mixing always produce a\nthermonuclear runaway and steady burning does not occur. For a broad range in\nWD mass (0.4 Solar masses to 1.35 Solar Masses), the maximum ejected material\noccurs for the 1.25 Solar Mass sequences and then decreases as the white dwarf\nmass decreases. Therefore, the white dwarfs are growing in mass as a\nconsequence of the accretion of solar material and as long as there is no\nmixing of accreted material with core material. In contrast, a thermonuclear\nrunaway in the accreted hydrogen-rich layers on the low luminosity WDs in close\nbinary systems where mixing of core matter with accreted material has occurred\nis the outburst mechanism for Classical, Recurrent, and Symbiotic novae. The\ndifferences in characteristics of these systems is likely the WD mass and mass\naccretion rate.

In this model we investigate the\neffect of kinematical backreaction on the evolution of cosmological parameters\nas they are defined in an averaged inhomogeneous cosmology, and we show that\nthe backreaction model interpolates between orthogonal symmetry properties by\ncovering subcases of the plane-symmetric solution, the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi\nsolution and the Szekeres solution. We so obtain a powerful model that lays the\nfoundations for quantitatively addressing curvature inhomogeneities as they\nwould be interpreted as Dark Energy or Dark Matter in a quasi-Newtonian\ncosmology. The present model, having a limited architecture due to an assumed\nFLRW background, is nevertheless capable of replacing 1/4 of the needed amount\nfor Dark Energy on domains of 200 Mpc in diameter for typical (one-sigma)\nfluctuations in a CDM initial power spectrum.

Among various correlations of the\ntotal number of GCs with other global galaxy properties, we find that N_GC\ncorrelates well though nonlinearly with the dynamical mass of the galaxy bulge\nM_dyn = 4 \\sigma_e^2 R_e /G, where \\sigma_e is the central velocity dispersion\nand R_e the effective radius of the galaxy light profile. We also present\nupdated versions of the GC specific frequency S_N and specific mass S_M versus\nhost galaxy luminosity and baryonic mass. These graphs exhibit the previously\nknown U-shape: highest S_N or S_M values occur for either dwarfs or\nsupergiants, but in the midrange of galaxy size (10^9 - 10^10 L_Sun) the GC\nnumbers fall along a well defined baseline value of S_N ~ 1 or S_M ~ 0.1,\nsimilar among all galaxy types. Along with other recent discussions, we suggest\nthat this trend may represent the effects of feedback, which systematically\ninhibited early star formation at either very low or very high galaxy mass, but\nwhich had its minimum effect for intermediate masses.

Abstract: Recent observations have indicated that a large fraction of the low to\nintermediate luminosity AGN population lives in disk-dominated hosts, while the\nmore luminous quasars live in bulge-dominated hosts, in conflict with some\nprevious model predictions. We therefore build and compare a semi-empirical\nmodel for AGN fueling which accounts for both merger and non-merger\n'triggering.' In particular, we show that the 'stochastic accretion' model - in\nwhich fueling in disk galaxies is essentially a random process arising whenever\ndense gas clouds reach the nucleus - provides a good match to the present\nobservations at low/intermediate luminosities. However it falls short of the\nhigh-luminosity population. We combine this with models for major\nmerger-induced AGN fueling, which lead to rarer but more luminous events, and\npredict the resulting abundance of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated AGN host\ngalaxies as a function of luminosity and redshift. We compile and compare\nobservational constraints from z~0-2. The models and observations generically\nshow a transition from disk to bulge dominance in hosts near the Seyfert-quasar\ntransition, at all redshifts. 'Stochastic' fueling dominates AGN by number\n(dominant at low luminosity), and dominates BH growth below the knee in the\npresent-day BH mass function (<10^7 M_sun). However it accounts for just ~10%\nof BH mass growth at masses >10^8 M_sun. In total, fueling in disky hosts\naccounts for ~30% of the total AGN luminosity density/BH mass density. The\ncombined model also accurately predicts the AGN luminosity function and\nclustering/bias as a function of luminosity and redshift; however, we argue\nthat these are not sensitive probes of BH fueling mechanisms. \n\n"}

This work addresses the AGN IR-selection dependency on intrinsic source\nluminosity and obscuration, in order to identify and charaterise biases which\ncould affect conclusions in studies. METHODS. We study IR-selected AGN in the\nChandra Deep Field South (CDFS) survey and in the Cosmological Survey (COSMOS).\nThe AGN sample is divided into low and high X-ray luminosity classes, and into\nunobscured (type-1) and obscured (type-2) classes by means of X-ray and optical\nspectroscopy data. Specifically in the X-rays regime, we adopt the intrinsic\nluminosity taking into account the estimated column density (N_H). We also take\nthe chance to highlight important differences resulting from adopting different\nmethods to assess AGN obscuration. RESULTS. In agreement with previous studies,\nwe also find that AGN IR-selection efficiency shows a decrease with decreasing\nsource AGN X-ray luminosity. For the intermediate-luminosity AGN population\n(43.3<~log(L_X[erg/s])<~44$), the efficiency also worsens with increasing\nobscuration.

We show that type-1 AGN are\nintrinsically more luminous than type-2 AGN only at z<~1.6, thus resulting in\nmore type-1 AGN being selected the shallower the IR survey is.

The mass of nuclear clusters\n$M_{\\rm nc}$ correlates more closely with the kinematic parameters and total\nmass of galaxies than the mass of central black holes $M_{\\rm bh}$, including\ncorrelation with the velocity $V_{\\textrm{max}}$, which characterizes the\nvirial mass of the dark halo. On average, lenticular galaxies are distinguished\nby higher masses $M_{\\rm bh}$ compared to other types of galaxies with similar\ncharacteristics. The dependence of masses of central objects on the color index\nis bimodal: galaxies of the red group (red-sequence), which have ($B{-}V) >\n0.6{-}0.7$, being mostly early-type galaxies, differ from bluer galaxies, by\nhigher values of $M_{\\rm nc}$ and $M_{\\rm bh}$. The red-group galaxies have\nsystematically higher $M_{\\rm bh}$ values, even when the host-galaxy parameters\nare similar. In contrast, in the case of nuclear stellar clusters, the \"blue\"\nand \"red\" galaxies form unified sequences at the diagrams.

Its\nimplication remains unclear. We propose to investigate the underlying\nmechanisms of this relation by considering the corresponding kinetic and\ndynamic mechanisms separately. In this way, one can tell how much the kinetic\nor dynamic mechanism contributes to the index of the relationship. Our analysis\ngives rise to several conclusions. (1) The index of the kinetic effect in the\n$L_p - E_p$ relation can simply be derived from the theory of special\nrelativity, which is generally larger than 2, depending on the situation\nconcerned. (2) The index of the dynamic effect in the relation can be deduced\nfrom observation once a model of jets is adopted. According to current GRB\ndata, we find: the dynamic effect alone tends to make an anti-correlation\nbetween $L_p$ and $E_p$; in terms of statistics, the dynamic effect is\nobviously smaller than the kinetic effect; in the situation of jets with moving\ndiscrete radio clouds which moves directly towards the observer, the index of\nthe dynamic effect is currently constrained within $(-1.6, -1)$, while in other\nsituations of jets, the constrains are different; both internal and external\nshocks can account for the current data. \n\n"}

In particular, magnetic\nreconnection during collisionless, stressed $X$-point collapse for varying\nout-of-plane guide-fields is studied using a kinetic, 2.5D, fully\nelectromagnetic, relativistic particle-in-cell numerical code. Cases for both\nopen and closed boundary conditions are investigated, where magnetic flux and\nparticles are lost and conserved respectively. It is found that reconnection\nrates and out-of-plane currents in the $X$-point increase more rapidly and peak\nsooner in the closed boundary case, but higher values are reached in the open\nboundary case. The normalized reconnection rate is fast: 0.10-0.25. In the open\nboundary case an increase of guide-field yields later onsets in the\nreconnection peak rates, while in the closed boundary case initial peak rates\noccur sooner but are suppressed. The reconnection current increases for low\nguide-fields but then decreases similarly. In the open boundary case, for\nguide-fields of the order of the in-plane magnetic field, the generation of\nelectron vortices occurs. Possible causes of the vortex generation, based on\nthe flow of particles in the diffusion region and localized plasma heating, are\ndiscussed. Before peak reconnection onset, oscillations in the out-of-plane\nelectric field at the $X$-point are found, ranging in frequency from\napproximately 1 to 2 $\\omega_{pe}$ and coinciding with oscillatory\nreconnection. These oscillations are found to be part of a larger wave pattern.\nMapping the out-of-plane electric field over time and applying 2D Fourier\ntransforms reveals that the waves predominantly correspond to the ordinary mode\nand may correspond to observable radio waves such as solar radio burst fine\nstructure spikes. \n\n"}

First, the FUV-NUV color distribution of\nstars in the Kepler field consists of 2 distinct peaks. Second, curiously, for\nstars with spectral types G or later the mean FUV-NUV color becomes much bluer,\ncontrary to expectation. we have found in two samples of mid-F through K type\nstars that ~14-18% of them exhibit FUV-excesses relative to their NUV fluxes\nand spectral types.

We derive a flaring in both discs that\ncauses the scale height of the average disc to be multiplied with respect to\nthe solar neighbourhood value by a factor of 3.3^{+2.2}_{-1.6} at R=15 kpc and\nby a factor of 12^{+20}_{-7} at R=25 kpc.\n  Conclusions. The flare is quite prominent at large R and its presence\nexplains the apparent depletion of in-plane stars that are often confused with\na cut-off at R>15 kpc. Indeed, our Galactic disc does not present a truncation\nor abrupt fall-off there, but the stars are spread in off-plane regions, even\nat z of several kpc for R>20 kpc. Moreover, the smoothness of the observed\nstellar distribution also suggests that there is a continuous structure and not\na combination of a Galactic disc plus some other substructure or extragalactic\ncomponent: the hypothesis to interpret the Monoceros ring in terms of a tidal\nstream of a putative accreted dwarf galaxy is not only unnecessary because the\nobserved flare explains the overdensity in the Monoceros ring observed in SDSS\nfields, but it appears to be inappropriate. \n\n"}

We found that the two optimal-filter\nluminosities extract virial information (size and virial velocity of the broad\nline region, BLR) from the spectra, justifying their usage in this empirical BH\nmass estimator. The major advantages of this new recipe over traditional SE BH\nmass estimators utilizing continuum luminosity and broad line width are: 1) it\nhas a smaller intrinsic scatter of 0.28 dex calibrated against RM masses; 2) it\nis extremely simple to use in practice, without any need to decompose the\nspectrum; 3) it produces unambiguous and highly repeatable results even with\nlow signal-to-noise spectra. The combination of the two luminosities can also\ncancel out, to some extent, systematic luminosity errors potentially introduced\nby uncertainties in distance or flux calibration. In addition, we recalibrated\nthe traditional SE mass estimators using broad Hbeta full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) and monochromatic continuum luminosity at 5100A (L_5100). We found that\nusing the best-fit slopes on FWHM and L_5100 (derived from fitting the BLR\nradius-luminosity relation and the correlation between rms line dispersion and\nSE FWHM, respectively) rather than simple assumptions (e.g., 0.5 for L_5100 and\n2 for FWHM) leads to more precise SE mass estimates, improving the intrinsic\nscatter from 0.41 dex to 0.36 dex with respect to the RM masses.

How such strong\nmagnetic fields can be generated and maintained is still an unsolved problem,\nwhich is, in principle, related to the interior structure of compact stars,\ni.e., the equation of state of cold matter at supra-nuclear density. In this\npaper we are trying to solve the problem in the regime of solid quark-cluster\nstars. Inside quark-cluster stars, the extremely low ratio of number density of\nelectrons to that of baryons $n_e/n_b$ and the screening effect from\nquark-clusters could reduce the long-range Coulomb interaction between\nelectrons to short-range interaction. In this case, the Stoner's model could\napply, and we find that the condition for ferromagnetism is consistent with\nthat for validity of Stoner's model. Under the screened Coulomb repulsion, the\nelectrons inside the stars could spontaneously magnetized and become\nferromagnetic, and hence would contribute non-zero net magnetic momentum to the\nwhole star.

However, the error in the precession frequency is\nusually increased. 3) A correction function of small magnitude corrects the\nfrequency problem. With this correction, even first order approximations yield\nexcellent fits at quite high eccentricity over a range of potential indices\nthat includes flat and falling rotation curve cases. 4) Adding a first harmonic\nterm to fit the breadth of the orbital loops, and determining the fundamental\nand harmonic coefficients by matching to three orbital positions further\nimproves the fit.

We point\nout that there is an essential difference between the thermalization and\nformation of a condensate due to repulsive interactions, which can indeed drive\nlong-range order, and that due to attractive interactions, which can lead to\nlocalized Bose clumps (stars or solitons) that only exhibit short range\ncorrelation.

To study mean trends with overall galaxy properties, the individual\nradial profiles are stacked in seven bins of galaxy morphology. We confirm that\nmore massive galaxies are more compact, older, more metal rich, and less\nreddened by dust. Additionally, we find that these trends are preserved\nspatially with the radial distance to the nucleus. Deviations from these\nrelations appear correlated with Hubble type: earlier types are more compact,\nolder, and more metal rich for a given mass, which evidences that quenching is\nrelated to morphology, but not driven by mass. Negative gradients of ages are\nconsistent with an inside-out growth of galaxies, with the largest ages\ngradients in Sb-Sbc galaxies. Further, the mean stellar ages of disks and\nbulges are correlated, with disks covering a wider range of ages, and late type\nspirals hosting younger disks.

We illustrate the\ncomplementarity of these two approaches by comparing the SV data with the\nBCC-UFig, a synthetic sky catalogue generated by forward-modelling of the DES\nSV images. We analyse the BCC-UFig simulation to construct galaxy samples\nmimicking those used in SV galaxy clustering studies. We show that the\nspatially-varying survey depth imprinted in the observed galaxy densities and\nthe redshift distributions of the SV data are successfully reproduced by the\nsimulation and well-captured by the maps of observing conditions. The combined\nuse of the maps, the SV data and the BCC-UFig simulation allows us to quantify\nthe impact of spatial systematics on $N(z)$, the redshift distributions\ninferred using photometric redshifts. We conclude that spatial systematics in\nthe SV data are mainly due to seeing fluctuations and are under control in\ncurrent clustering and weak lensing analyses. The framework presented here is\nrelevant to all multi-epoch surveys, and will be essential for exploiting\nfuture surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will\nrequire detailed null-tests and realistic end-to-end image simulations to\ncorrectly interpret the deep, high-cadence observations of the sky. \n\n"}

Put simply, the TBTF problem consists of the fact that it is\ndifficult to explain both the measured kinematics of dwarfs and their observed\nnumber density within the LCDM framework. The most popular proposed solutions\nto the problem involve baryonic feedback processes. For example, reionization\nand baryon depletion can decrease the abundance of halos that are expected to\nhost dwarf galaxies. Moreover, feedback related to star formation can alter the\ndark matter density profile in the central regions of low-mass halos. In this\narticle we assess the TBTF problem for field dwarfs, taking explicitly into\naccount the baryonic effects mentioned above. We find that 1) reionization\nfeedback cannot resolve the TBTF problem on its own, because the halos in\nquestion are too massive to be affected by it, and that 2) the degree to which\nprofile modification can be invoked as a solution to the TBTF problem depends\non the radius at which galactic kinematics are measured. Based on a literature\nsample of about 90 dwarfs with interferometric observations in the 21cm line of\natomic hydrogen (HI), we conclude that the TBTF problem persists despite\nbaryonic effects.

We find that the centre\nof BCG correlates more strongly with the minimum of the gravitational potential\nthan the X-ray defined centres, while AGN feedback acts to significantly\nenhance the offset between the peak X-ray luminosity and minimum gravitational\npotential. These results highlight the importance of centre identification when\ninterpreting clusters observations, in particular when comparing theoretical\npredictions and observational data. \n\n"}

Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we\ninvestigate particle and radiation beaming, finding a very different picture.\nInstead of having a relativistic average bulk motion with isotropic electron\nvelocity distribution in its rest frame, we find that the bulk motion of\nparticles in X-points is similar to their Lorentz factor gamma, and the\nparticles are beamed within about 5/gamma. On the way from the X-point to the\nmagnetic islands, particles turn in the magnetic field, forming a fan confined\nto the current sheet. Once they reach the islands they isotropise after\ncompleting a full Larmor gyration and their radiation is not strongly beamed\nanymore. The radiation pattern at a given frequency depends on where the\ncorresponding emitting electrons radiate their energy. Lower energy particles\nthat cool slowly spend most of their time in the islands, and their radiation\nis not highly beamed. Only particles that quickly cool at the edge of the\nX-points generate a highly beamed fan-like radiation pattern. The radiation\nemerging from these fast cooling particles is above the burn-off limit (about\n100 MeV in the overall rest frame of the reconnecting plasma.)

In all pairs of bands\ncompared, the harder band consistently lags the softer band by at least 1000s,\nat temporal frequencies ~5E-5 Hz. In addition, soft-band lags up to 400s are\nmeasured at frequencies ~2E-4 Hz. Light echos from an excess of soft band\nemission in the inner accretion disk cannot explain the lags in these data, as\nthey are seen in cross-correlations with energy bands where the softer band is\nexpected to have no contribution from reflection. The basic properties of the\ntime delays have been parameterised by fitting a top hat response function that\nvaries with photon energy, taking fully into account the covariance between\nmeasured time lag values. The low-frequency hard-band lags and the transition\nto soft-band lags are consistent with time lags arising as reverberation delays\nfrom circumnuclear scattering of X-rays, although greater model complexity is\nrequired to explain the entire spectrum of lags.

We propose that the\ntransformation of NSCs into SMBHs occurs via runaway tidal captures, once NSCs\nexceed a certain critical central density and velocity dispersion. The\nbottleneck in this process, as with all collisional runaways, is growing the\nfirst e-fold in black hole mass. The growth of a stellar mass black hole past\nthis bottleneck occurs as tidally captured stars are consumed in repeated\nepisodes of mass transfer at pericenter. Tidal captures may turn off as a\ngrowth channel once the black hole reaches a mass ~100-1000 solar masses, but\ntidal disruption events will continue and appear capable of growing the seed\nSMBH to larger sizes. The runaway slows (becomes sub-exponential) once the seed\nSMBH consumes the core of its host NSC. While the bulk of the cosmic mass\ndensity in SMBHs is ultimately produced (via the Soltan-Paczynski argument) by\nepisodic gaseous accretion in very massive galaxies, the smallest SMBHs have\nprobably grown from strong tidal encounters with NSC stars. SMBH seeds that\ngrow for a time $t$ entirely through this channel will follow simple power law\nrelations with the velocity dispersion, $\\sigma$, of their host galaxy. In the\nsimplest regime it is $M_\\bullet \\sim \\sigma^{3/2}\\sqrt{M_\\star t / G} \\sim\n10^{6}M_\\odot (\\sigma / 50~{\\rm km~s}^{-1})^{3/2}(t/10^{10}~{\\rm yr})^{1/2}$,\nbut the exponents and prefactor can differ slightly depending on the details of\nloss cone refilling.

We investigate how IA\ncorrelations depend on observable galaxy properties such as stellar mass,\napparent magnitude, redshift, and photometric type, and on the employed shape\nmeasurement method. The correlations considered include the matter\ndensity-intrinsic ellipticity (mI), galaxy density-intrinsic ellipticity (dI),\ngravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity (GI), and intrinsic\nellipticity-intrinsic ellipticity (II) correlations. We find stronger\ncorrelations for more massive and more luminous galaxies, as well as for\nearlier photometric types, in agreement with observations. Moreover, the\ncorrelations significantly depend on the choice of shape estimator, even if\ncalibrated to serve as unbiased shear estimators. In particular, shape\nestimators that down-weight the outer parts of galaxy images produce much\nweaker IA signals on intermediate and large scales than methods employing flat\nradial weights. The expected contribution of intrinsic alignments to the\nobserved ellipticity correlation in tomographic cosmic shear surveys may be\nbelow one percent or several percent of the full signal depending on the\ndetails of the shape measurement method. A comparison of our results to a tidal\nalignment model indicates that such a model is able to reproduce the IA\ncorrelations well on intermediate and large scales, provided the effect of\nvarying galaxy density is correctly taken into account. We also find that the\nGI contributions to the observed ellipticity correlations could be inferred\ndirectly from measurements of galaxy density-intrinsic ellipticity\ncorrelations, except on small scales, where systematic differences between mI\nand dI correlations are large. \n\n"}

We find that this pulsar population exhibits a luminosity function that\nis quite similar to those millisecond pulsars observed in the field of the\nMilky Way (i.e. the thick disk). After pulsars are expelled from a globular\ncluster, however, they continue to lose rotational kinetic energy and become\nless luminous, causing their luminosity function to depart from the\nsteady-state distribution.

The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale\nStructures (EFTofLSS) provides a consistent framework to make predictions for\nLSS observables in the mildly non-linear regime.

The\nkinematics of the molecular gas in this feature can be interpreted (albeit not\nuniquely) as accelerating at a rate of 1 km s^-1 pc^-1. In this scenario, the\ngas is approaching escape velocity at the last measured point.

The ram pressure exerted\nby the flow can truncate the disc and the accretion of material with no\nazimuthal angular momentum leads to further disc contraction. We derive a\ntheoretical model from accretion disc theory that describes the evolution of\nthe disc radius, mass, and surface density profile as a function of the density\nand velocity of the ambient medium. We test our model by performing\nhydrodynamical simulations of a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow with\ndifferent velocities and densities. We find that our model gives an adequate\ndescription of the evolution of the disc radius and accretion rate onto the\ndisc. The total disc mass in the simulations follows the theoretically expected\ntrend, except at the lowest density where our simulated discs lose mass owing\nto continuous stripping. This stripping may be a numerical rather than a\nphysical effect. Some quantitative differences exist between the model\npredictions and the simulations.

Our goal is\nto conduct a homogeneous study of young B type stars in the cluster NGC 2264\nusing photometric time series from space in combination with high-resolution\nspectroscopy and spectropolarimetry obtained from the ground. The latter will\nbe presented in a separate follow-up article. We performed frequency analyses\nfor eleven B stars in the field of the young cluster NGC 2264 using photometric\ntime series from the MOST, CoRoT and Spitzer space telescopes and the routines\nPeriod04 and SigSpec. We employ the MESA stellar evolution code in combination\nwith the oscillation code GYRE to identify the pulsation modes for two SPB\nstars which exhibit short period spacing series. From our analysis we identify\nfour objects that show SPB pulsations, five stars that show rotational\nmodulation of their light curves caused by spots, one star that is identified\nto be a binary, and one object in the field of the cluster that is found to be\na non-member Be star. In two SPB stars we detect a number of regularly spaced\npulsation modes that are compatible with being members of a g mode period\nseries. Despite NGC 2264's young age, our analysis illustrates that its B type\nmembers have already arrived on the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS). Our\nasteroseismic analysis yields masses between 4 and 6 Msun and ages between 1\nand 6 million years, which agree well to the overall cluster age. \n\n"}

Hydrogen deuteride (HD) is a promising\nalternative to the commonly-used gas mass tracer, CO. We aim to examine the\nrobustness of HD as tracer of the disk gas mass, specifically the effect of gas\nmass on the HD FIR emission and its sensitivity to the vertical structure.\nDeuterium chemistry reactions relevant for HD were implemented in the\nthermochemical code DALI and models were run for a range of disk masses and\nvertical structures. The HD J=1-0 line intensity depends directly on the gas\nmass through a sublinear power law relation with a slope of ~0.8. Assuming no\nprior knowledge about the vertical structure of a disk and using only the HD\n1-0 flux, gas masses can be estimated to within a factor of 2 for low mass\ndisks (M$_{\\rm disk} < 10^{-3}$ M$_\\odot$). For more massive disks, this\nuncertainty increases to more than an order of magnitude. Adding the HD 2-1\nline or independent information about the vertical structure can reduce this\nuncertainty to a factor of ~3 for all disk masses. For TW Hya, using the radial\nand vertical structure from Kama et al. 2016b the observations constrain the\ngas mass to $6\\cdot10^{-3}$ M$_\\odot$ < M$_{\\rm disk} < 9\\cdot10^{-3}$\nM$_\\odot$.

Our main\nfindings are as follows. (i) At M_{*,z=0}>~10^{9.5}Msun, the evolution of the\nmedian main progenitor differs, with quenched galaxies hardly growing in median\nsize before quenching, whereas main-sequence galaxies grow their median size\ncontinuously, thus opening a gap from the progenitors of quenched galaxies.\nThis is partly because the main-sequence high-redshift progenitors of quenched\nz=0 galaxies are drawn from the lower end of the size distribution of the\noverall population of main-sequence high-redshift galaxies. (ii) Quenched\ngalaxies with M_{*,z=0}>~10^{9.5}Msun experience a steep size growth on the\nsize-mass plane after their quenching time, but with the exception of galaxies\nwith M_{*,z=0}>~10^{11}Msun, the size growth after quenching is small in\nabsolute terms, such that most of the size (and mass) growth of quenched\ngalaxies (and its variation among them) occurs while they are still on the\nmain-sequence. After they become quenched, the size growth rate of quenched\ngalaxies as a function of time, as opposed to versus mass, is similar to that\nof main-sequence galaxies. Hence, the size gap is retained down to z=0. \n\n"}

Magnetic topology of the MHD\n  background field Abstract: Using a potential field source surface (PFSS) model, we recently analyzed the\nglobal topology of the background coronal magnetic field for a sequence of\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs) that occurred on 2010 August 1-2. Here we repeat\nthis analysis for the background field reproduced by a magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) model that incorporates plasma thermodynamics. As for the PFSS model, we\nfind that all three CME source regions contain a coronal hole that is separated\nfrom neighboring coronal holes by topologically very similar pseudo-streamer\nstructures. However, the two models yield very different results for the size,\nshape, and flux of the coronal holes. We find that the helmet-streamer cusp\nline, which corresponds to a source-surface null line in the PFSS model, is\nstructurally unstable and does not form in the MHD model. Our analysis\nindicates that generally, in MHD configurations, this line rather consists of a\nmultiple-null separator passing along the edge of disconnected flux regions.\nSome of these regions are transient and may be the origin of so-called streamer\nblobs. We show that the core topological structure of such blobs is a\nthree-dimensional \"plasmoid\", consisting of two conjoined flux ropes of\nopposite handedness, which connect at a spiral null point of the magnetic\nfield. Our analysis reveals that such plasmoids appear also in pseudo-streamers\non much smaller scales.

Previous\nthree-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations indicate that atmospheres of\nlow-mass planets cannot be considered isolated from the protoplanetary disc,\ncontrary to what is assumed in 1D-evolutionary calculations. This finding is\nreferred to as the recycling hypothesis. In this Paper we investigate the\nrecycling hypothesis for super-Earth planets, accounting for realistic 3D\nradiation hydrodynamics. Also, we conduct a direct comparison in terms of the\nevolution of the entropy between 1D and 3D geometries. We clearly see that 3D\natmospheres maintain higher entropy: although gas in the atmosphere loses\nentropy through radiative cooling, the advection of high entropy gas from the\ndisc into the Bondi/Hill sphere slows down Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction,\npotentially arresting envelope growth at a sub-critical gas mass fraction.\nRecycling, therefore, operates vigorously, in line with results by previous\nstudies. However, we also identify an \"inner core\" -- in size $\\approx$ 25% of\nthe Bondi radius -- where streamlines are more circular and entropies are much\nlower than in the outer atmosphere.

A significant contribution by faint AGNs, however, could\nsolve the problem, as recently advocated on the basis of a relatively large\nspace density of faint active nuclei at z>4.

The spatial density distribution of the interstellar gas is a\nvital element for all these studies.

While state-of-the art\nsimulations excel at reproducing galactic disk properties, many struggle to\ndrive strong galactic winds or to match the observed ionization structure of\nthe CGM using only thermal supernova feedback. To remedy this, recent studies\nhave invoked non-thermal cosmic ray (CR) stellar feedback prescriptions.\nHowever, numerical schemes of CR transport are still poorly constrained. We\nexplore how the choice of CR transport affects the multiphase structure of the\nsimulated CGM. We implement anisotropic CR physics in the astrophysical\nsimulation code, {\\sc Enzo} and simulate a suite of isolated disk galaxies with\nvarying prescriptions for CR transport: isotropic diffusion, anisotropic\ndiffusion, and streaming. We find that all three transport mechanisms result in\nstrong, metal-rich outflows but differ in the temperature and ionization\nstructure of their CGM. Isotropic diffusion results in a spatially uniform,\nwarm CGM that underpredicts the column densities of low-ions. Anisotropic\ndiffusion develops a reservoir of cool gas that extends further from the\ngalactic center, but disperses rapidly with distance. CR streaming projects\ncool gas out to radii of 200 kpc, supporting a truly multiphase medium. In\naddition, we find that streaming is less sensitive to changes in constant\nparameter values like the CR injection fraction, transport velocity, and\nresolution than diffusion. We conclude that CR streaming is a more robust\nimplementation of CR transport and motivate the need for detailed parameter\nstudies of CR transport. \n\n"}

Abstract: Although several theories for the origin of cosmic rays in the region between\nthe spectral `knee' and `ankle' exist, this problem is still unsolved. A\nvariety of observations suggest that the transition from Galactic to\nextragalactic sources occurs in this energy range. In this work we examine\nwhether a Galactic wind which eventually forms a termination shock far outside\nthe Galactic plane can contribute as a possible source to the observed flux in\nthe region of interest. Previous work by Bustard et al. (2017) estimated that\nparticles can be accelerated up to energies above the `knee' up to\n$R_\\mathrm{max} = 10^{16}$ eV for parameters drawn from a model of a Milky Way\nwind (Everett et al. 2017). A remaining question is whether the accelerated\ncosmic rays can propagate back into the Galaxy. To answer this crucial\nquestion, we simulate the propagation of the cosmic rays using the low energy\nextension of the CRPropa framework, based on the solution of the transport\nequation via stochastic differential equations. The setup includes all relevant\nprocesses, including three-dimensional anisotropic spatial diffusion,\nadvection, and corresponding adiabatic cooling. We find that, assuming\nrealistic parameters for the shock evolution, a possible Galactic termination\nshock can contribute significantly to the energy budget in the `knee' region\nand above.

In the light of these developments, we evaluate the\nBayesian evidence against HZ in different data combinations and model\nextensions. Considering only the Planck temperature data, we find inconclusive\nevidence against HZ when including variations in the neutrino number $N_{\\rm\neff}$ and/or the Helium abundance $Y_{\\rm He}$. Adding the Planck polarization\ndata, on the other hand, yields strong evidence against HZ in the extensions we\nconsidered.

However, with the inclusion of\npolarisation, standard $\\Lambda$CDM is once again preferred, but the HZ model\nwith extra neutrinos is not strongly disfavored. The possibility of fully\nruling out the HZ spectrum is therefore ultimately connected with the solution\nto current tensions between cosmological datasets.

Our images demonstrate that the\nbrightest wings close to the star in the near side of the disk are a unique\nstructure, corresponding to the outer edge of the intermediate disk at ~40au.\nModeling of the scattered light from the disk with a geometrical algorithm\nreveals that a moderately thin structure can well reproduce the light\ndistribution in the flux-conservative images. We suggest that the gap between\n44 and 113 au span between the 1:2 and 3:2 resonance orbits of a massive body\nlocated at ~70au that might coincide with the candidate planet HD100546b\ndetected with previous thermal IR observations. In this picture, the two wings\ncan be the near side of a ring formed by disk material brought out of the disk\nat the 1:2 resonance with the same massive object. While we find no clear\nevidence confirming detection of the planet candidate HD100546c in our data, we\nfind a diffuse emission close to the expected position of HD100546b. This\nsource can be described as an extremely reddened substellar object surrounded\nby a dust cloud or its circumplanetary disk.

Overall, above logM_ast/M_sun>10.25 and SSFR>10^{-12} yr^{-1},\nthe SFR-M_ast and SSFR-M_ast relations do not depend on environment, when the\nglobal environment is used, while when the halo mass is considered, high mass\nhaloes might have a systematically lower (S)SFR-M_ast relation. Finally, when\nlocal densities are exploited, at any given mass galaxies in less dense\nenvironments have systematically higher values of SFR.

First, the planet\noccurrence rate for the above size and period ranges is $0.70^{+0.40}_{-0.20}$\nplanets per Sun-like star, with the frequency of cold Jupiters agreeing with\nthat from radial velocity surveys. Planet occurrence rises with decreasing\nplanet size, roughly describable as $dN/d\\log R \\propto R^{\\alpha}$ with\n$\\alpha = -1.6^{+1.0}_{-0.9}$, i.e., Neptune-sized planets are some four times\nmore common than Jupiter-sized ones. Second, five out of our 15 candidates\norbit stars with known transiting planets at shorter periods, including one\nwith five inner planets. We interpret this high incidence rate to mean: (1)\nalmost all our candidates should be genuine; (2) across a large orbital range\n(from $\\sim 0.05$ to a few astronomical units), mutual inclinations in these\nsystems are at most a few degrees; and (3) large outer planets exist almost\nexclusively in systems with small inner planets. \n\n"}

Of those satellites that are disrupted, only a few per\ncent merge with other satellites, even in low-mass groups. The survival\nfraction changes rapidly from less than 10 per cent of those accreted at high z\nto more than 90 per cent at low z. This shift, which reflects faster disruption\nof satellites accreted at higher z, happens at lower z for more massive\ngalaxies and those accreted onto less massive haloes.

Drag forces and accretion rates dictate how these systems are\ntransformed by these interactions. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flows, in which a binary moves\nsupersonically relative to a homogeneous medium, using the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code FLASH. We simulate a range of values of the initial semi-major\naxis of the orbit relative to the gravitational focusing impact parameter of\nthe pair. When the binary separation is less than the gravitational focusing\nimpact parameter, the pair orbits within a shared bow shock. When the pair is\nwider, each object has an individual bow-shock structure. The long-term\nevolution of the binary is determined by the timescales for accretion, slowing\nof the center of mass, and orbital inspiral. We find a clear hierarchy of these\ntimescales; a binary's center-of-mass motion is slowed over a shorter timescale\nthan the pair inspirals or accretes. In contrast to previous analytic\npredictions, which assume an unperturbed background medium, we find that the\ntimescale for orbital inspiral is proportional to the semi-major axis to the\n$0.19 \\pm 0.01$ power. This positive scaling indicates that gaseous drag forces\ncan drive binaries either to coalescence or to the critical separation at which\ngravitational radiation dominates their further evolution.

Using the\nmulti-waveband data to compare the appearance of galaxies at the same\nrest-frame wavelengths reveals that \"morphological k-corrections\" (the change\nin appearance when viewing high-z objects at shorter rest-frame wavelengths)\nare only important in a minority of cases, and that galaxies were intrinsically\nmore peculiar at high redshift. One example of significant morphological\nk-corrections is spiral galaxies, which often show more pronounced barred\nstructure in the near-infrared than in the optical. Therefore, the apparent\ndecline in the fraction of barred spirals at faint magnitudes in the optical\nHDF may be due to band-shifting effects at the higher redshifts, rather than\nintrinsic evolution.

On the other hand, the analysis in the very hard\n5-10 keV band reveals a relatively steep LogN-LogS (slope ~=1.3) down to 1e-15\nerg/cm^2/s.

This is the most natural outcome of\nsupranova model where initially a supernova explosion takes place, leaving a\nsupra-massive NS, which loses its rotational energy over a time t_sd and\ncollapses to a BH, triggering a GRB explosion. We find that the time delay t_sd\nbetween the supernova and GRB events is the most important parameter that\ndetermines the behavior of the system. We consider the afterglow, prompt GRB\nand direct emission from the PWB. The observational signatures for different\nt_sd are described and joined together into one coherent framework. Constraints\non the model are derived for a spherical PWB, from the lack of detection of the\nPWB emission and afterglow observations. For very low values of t_sd<1 hr the\nsupranova model reduces to the collapsar model; 0.4<t_sd/1yr<1 is required to\nproduce the iron lines seen in some X-ray afterglows. However, we find that for\na spherical PWB, this implies no detectable radio afterglow, a small jet break\ntime and non-relativistic transition time, in disagreement with observations\nfor some of these GRBs. These discrepancies with the observations may be\nreconciled by resorting to a non-spherical geometry. We find that light element\nlines, recently detected in a few X-ray afterglows, are expected to dominate\nover iron lines for small t_sd, while for large t_sd the situation is reversed.\nFinally, we predict that external Compton scattering of the PWB photons by the\nafterglow relativistic electrons, should lead to high energy emission during\nthe early afterglow that may explain the GeV photons detected by EGRET in some\nGRBs, and should be detectable by future missions (GLAST). \n\n"}

Abstract: We address the issue of accuracy in recovering density profiles from\nobservations of rotation curves of galaxies. We ``observe'' and analyze our\nmodels in much the same way as observers do the real galaxies. We find that the\ntilted ring model analysis produces an underestimate of the central rotational\nvelocity. In some cases the galaxy halo density profile seems to have a flat\ncore, while in reality it does not. We identify three effects, which explain\nthe systematic biases: (1) inclination (2), small bulge, and (3) bar. The\npresence of even a small non-rotating bulge component reduces the rotation\nvelocity. In the case of a disk with a bar, the underestimate of the circular\nvelocity is larger due to a combination of non-circular motions and random\nvelocities. Signatures of bars can be difficult to detect in the surface\nbrightness profiles of the model galaxies. The variation of inclination angle\nand isophote position angle with radius are more reliable indicators of bar\npresence than the surface brightness profiles. The systematic biases in the\ncentral ~ 1 kpc of galaxies are not large. Each effect separately gives\ntypically a few kms error, but the effects add up. In some cases the error in\ncircular velocity was a factor of two, but typically we get about 20 percent.\nThe result is the false inference that the density profile of the halo flattens\nin the central parts. Our observations of real galaxies show that for a large\nfraction of galaxies the velocity of gas rotation (as measured by emission\nlines) is very close to the rotation of stellar component (as measured by\nabsorption lines). This implies that the systematic effects discussed in this\npaper are also applicable both for the stars and emission-line gas. \n\n"}

In order\nfor the beams/jets associated with gamma-ray bursts to form in mergers within\nmassive common envelopes (as with SN 1987A), much of the intervening stellar\nmaterial in the polar directions must be cleared out by the time of\ncore-collapse, or the beams/jets themselves must clear their own path.

The position of the inner radius of a thin disk around a\nneutron star can be estimated by comparing the electromagnetic energy density\ngenerated by the neutron star with the kinetic energy density of the disk.\nInside the light cylinder, the near zone electromagnetic field is essentially\nthe dipole magnetic field, and the inner radius is the conventional Alfven\nradius. Far outside the light cylinder, in the radiation zone, $E=B$ and the\nelectromagnetic energy density is $<S >/c \\propto 1/r^2$ where $S$ is the\nPoynting vector. Shvartsman (1970) argued that a stable equilibrium can not be\nfound in the radiative zone because the electromagnetic energy density\ndominates over the kinetic energy density, with the relative strength of the\nelectromagnetic stresses increasing with radius. In order to check whether this\nis true also near the light cylinder, we employ global electromagnetic field\nsolutions for rotating oblique magnetic dipoles (Deutsch 1955). Near the light\ncylinder the electromagnetic energy density increases steeply enough with\ndecreasing $r$ to balance the kinetic energy density at a stable equilibrium.\nThe transition from the near zone to the radiation zone is broad. The radiation\npressure of the pulsar can not disrupt the disk for values of the inner radius\nup to about twice the light cylinder radius if the rotation axis and the\nmagnetic axis are orthogonal. This allowed range beyond the light cylinder\nextends much further for small inclination angles.

Our numerical algorithm is a symplectic integrator designed specifically\nfor the problem at hand; however, we have checked our results with SYMBA, a\nversion of the widely available SWIFT code.

If the IMBH is on a circular orbit, then the inclinations of\nnumerically computed orbits relative to the inspiral plane are almost always\nsmaller than 10 degrees, and therefore (a) the simulations are in good\nagreement with the observed motions of stars in a clockwise-moving stellar\ndisc, (b) the simulations never reproduce the orbits of stars outside this\ndisc, which include those in the second thick ring of stars and the randomly\noriented unrelaxed orbits of some of the S-stars.

They are particularly interesting because they\nprobe not only the galaxies themselves but also the ionization state of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM). The observed line strengths depend on the amount by\nwhich each photon is able to redshift away from line center before encountering\nneutral gas and hence on the size distribution of HII regions surrounding the\nsources. Here, we use an analytic model of that size distribution to study the\neffects of reionization on the luminosity function of Lyman-alpha emitters and\ntheir observed spatial distribution. Our model includes the clustering of\nhigh-redshift galaxies and thus contains ionized bubbles much larger than those\nexpected around isolated galaxies. As a result, Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies\nremain visible earlier in reionization: we expect the number counts to decline\nby only a factor ~2 (or 10) when the mean ionized fraction falls to x_i~0.75\n(or 0.5) in the simplest model. Moreover, the absorption is not uniform across\nthe sky: galaxies remain visible only if they sit inside large bubbles, which\nbecome increasingly rare as x_i decreases. Thus, the size distribution also\naffects the apparent clustering of Lyman-alpha selected galaxies. On large\nscales, it traces that of the large bubbles, which in our model are more biased\nthan the galaxies. On small scales, the clustering increases rapidly as x_i\ndecreases because large HII regions surround strong galaxy overdensities, so a\nsurvey automatically selects only those galaxies with neighbours. The\ntransition between these two regimes occurs at the characteristic bubble size.\nHence, large Lyman-alpha galaxy surveys have the potential to measure directly\nthe size distribution of HII regions during reionization. \n\n"}

The high intensity phases last\nbetween a few to upto 110 days and the separation between two high intensity\nphases also varies widely. One remarkable feature deduced from the RXTE-ASM\nlight curves is that during these high intensity phases, Cen X-3 manifests in\ntwo very distinct spectral states. When the source makes a transition from the\nlow intensity phase to the high intensity phase, it adopts one of these two\nspectral states and during the entire high intensity phase remains in that\nparticular spectral state. During December 2000 to April 2004, all the high\nintensity episodes showed a hardness ratio which is significantly larger than\nthe same during all the high states prior to and subsequent to this period.

However, the computation of the optical properties of such\nparticles is still a very difficult problem. We analyze how the increase of\ngrain porosity influences basic features of cosmic dust -- interstellar\nextinction, dust temperature, infrared bands and millimeter opacity. Porous\ngrains can reproduce the flat extinction across the $3 - 8 \\mkm$ wavelength\nrange measured for several lines of sight by {\\it ISO} and {\\it Spitzer}.\n  Porous grains are generally cooler than compact grains. At the same time, the\ntemperature of very porous grains becomes slightly larger in the case of the\nEMT-Mie calculations in comparison with the results found from the\nlayered-sphere model. The layered-sphere model predicts a broadening of\ninfrared bands and a shift of the peak position to larger wavelengths as\nporosity grows. In the case of the EMT-Mie model variations of the feature\nprofile are less significant. It is also shown that the millimeter mass\nabsorption coefficients grow as porosity increases with a faster growth\noccurring for particles with Rayleigh/non-Rayleigh inclusions. As a result, for\nvery porous particles the coefficients given by two models can differ by a\nfactor of about 3.\n  It is found that an increase of porosity leads to an increase of extinction\ncross sections at some wavelengths and a decrease at others depending on the\ngrain model.

The effect is quantified by the computation of the luminosity\nfunction (LF) of red galaxies. We found a flat slope, showing that the\nabundance of red galaxies is similar at faint and at intermediate magnitudes.\nComparison with present-day and z~0.4 LFs suggests that the slope of the LF is\nnot changed, within the errors, between z=0.831 and z=0. Therefore, the\nanalysis of the LF shows no evidence for a decreasing (with magnitude or\nredshift) number of faint red galaxies. The presence of faint red galaxies in\nhigh redshift clusters disfavours scenarios where the evolution of red galaxies\nis mass-dependent, because the mass dependency should differentially\ndepauperate the red sequence, while the MS1054-0321 colour-magnitude relation\nis populated as in nearby clusters and as in z~0.4 clusters.

Although this model accurately\nfits the global statistics of the galaxy population, as well as the shape of\nthe conditional luminosity function, there are significant discrepancies when\nthe blue fraction of galaxies as a function of mass and luminosity is compared\nbetween the observations and the model.

Elliptical galaxies with similar L_B have\nluminosities at 70 and 160 microns (L_70 and L_160) that vary over a factor ~\n100, implying an additional source of dust unrelated to that produced by\nongoing local stellar mass loss. Neither L_70/L_B nor L_160/L_B correlate with\nthe stellar age or metallicity. Optical line fluxes from warm gas at T ~ 10^4 K\ncorrelate weakly with L_70 and L_160, suggesting that the dust may be\nresponsible for cooling this gas. Many normal elliptical galaxies have emission\nat 70 microns that is extended to 5-10 kpc. Extended far-infrared emission with\nsputtering lifetimes of ~10^8 yrs is difficult to maintain by mergers with\ngas-rich galaxies. Instead, we propose that this cold dust is buoyantly\ntransported from reservoirs of dust in the galactic cores which is supplied by\nmass loss from stars in the core.

This correction\nresults in a greatly reduced scatter in the Lx-T relation; cooling flow\nclusters are similar to others outside the small cooling flow regions. For a\nfit of the form L_bol ~ T^alpha, we obtain alpha=2.64+-0.27 (90%) and a\nresidual rms scatter in log L_bol of 0.10. The derived relation can be directly\ncompared to theoretical predictions that do not include radiative cooling.

For a qualitative estimate of constraints\nthat the new data place on the density fluctuation spectrum, we apply the\nPress-Schechter formalism for Omega=1 and 0.3.

The Galaxy is\nmodelled as realistic as possible, with three components: bulge, disk and dark\nhalo. The main finding is that there exist two giant tidal tails around the\nglobuler cluster in permanence along its orbit, whatever this orbit. The length\nof these tails is of the order of 5 tidal radii, or greater. The escaped stars\nare distributed radially as a power law in density, with a slope of -4.

{"id": "hep-th/0210165", "contents": "Title: Back Reaction of Cosmological Perturbations and the Cosmological\n  Constant Problem Abstract: The presence of cosmological fluctuations influences the background cosmology\nin which the perturbations evolve. This back-reaction arises as a second order\neffect in the cosmological perturbation expansion. The effect is cumulative in\nthe sense that all fluctuation modes contribute to the change in the background\ngeometry, and as a consequence the back-reaction effect can be large even if\nthe amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is small. We review two approaches\nused to quantify back-reaction. In the first approach, the effect of the\nfluctuations on the background is expressed in terms of an effective\nenergy-momentum tensor. We show that in the context of an inflationary\nbackground cosmology, the long wavelength contributions to the effective\nenergy-momentum tensor take the form of a negative cosmological constant, whose\nabsolute value increases as a function of time since the phase space of\ninfrared modes is increasing. This then leads to the speculation that\ngravitational back-reaction may lead to a dynamical cancellation mechanism for\na bare cosmological constant, and yield a scaling fixed point in the asymptotic\nfuture in which the remnant cosmological constant satisfies $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}\n\\sim 1$. We then discuss how infrared modes effect local observables (as\nopposed to mathematical background quantities) and find that the leading\ninfrared back-reaction contributions cancel in single field inflationary\nmodels.
