Muon measurements can\ncomplement the central-particle data collected at colliders. This paper will\nreview muon production data and discuss some non-perturbative (soft) models\nthat have been used to interpret the data. I will show measurements of TeV muon\ntransverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra in cosmic-ray air showers from MACRO, and\ndescribe how the IceCube neutrino observatory and the proposed Km3Net detector\nwill extend these measurements to a higher $p_T$ region where perturbative QCD\nshould apply.

The\nvelocity distribution is mostly sensitive to the relative spiral arm phase and\npattern speed. In all cases the arms induce strong kinematic imprints for\npattern speeds around 17 km/s/kpc (close to the 4:1 inner resonance) but no\nsubstructure is induced close to corotation.

While galactic supernovae can be\nresolved with this technique, the supernova neutrino emission spectrum remains\nunconstrained and thus presents a limited potential for the topics related to\nsupernova core collapse models.\n  The paper elaborates analytically on the capabilities of IceCube to detect\nsupernovae through the analysis of hits in the detector correlated in space and\ntime. These arise from supernova neutrinos interacting in the instrumented\ndetector volume along single strings. Although the effective detection volume\nfor such coincidental hits is much smaller ($\\gtrsim 35\\,$kton, about the scale\nof SuperK), a wealth of information is obtained due to the comparatively low\ncoincidental noise rate.

The\nredshift dependence of the IA signal has been used at the 2-point level to\nreduce this contamination by only measuring cross-correlations between large\nredshift bins, which significantly reduces the galaxy intrinsic ellipticity -\nintrinsic ellipticity (II) correlation. A self-calibration technique based on\nthe redshift dependences of the IA correlations has also been proposed as a\nmeans to remove the 2-point IA contamination from the lensing signal. We\nexplore here the redshift dependences of the IA and lensing bispectra in order\nto propose a self-calibration of the IA auto-correlations at the 3-point level\n(i.e. GGI, GII, and III), which can be well understood without the assumption\nof any particular IA model.

By interfacing simple branching histories\nof medium-modified color flow with the Lund hadronization model, we analyze how\nthe medium modification of color correlations can affect the distribution of\nhadronic fragments in jets. Importantly, we observe that jet-medium\ninteractions give rise to the medium-induced color decoherence of gluons from\nthe parton shower. Since hadronization respects color flow and since each color\nsinglet in a parton shower is hadronized separately, this medium-induced color\ndecoherence leaves characteristic signatures in the jet fragmentation pattern.\nIn particular, it can contribute to the quenching of leading hadron spectra.\nMoreover, it can increase strongly the yield of soft hadronic fragments from a\njet, while the distribution of more energetic hadrons follows naturally the\nshape of a vacuum-like fragmentation pattern of lower total energy. \n\n"}

In the present calculation, we consider\nnot only the tensor coupling of vector mesons to octet baryons and the form\nfactors at interaction vertexes but also the internal (quark) structure change\nof baryons in dense matter. The relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations are\nperformed in two ways: one is the calculation with the coupling constants\ndetermined by SU(6) (quark model) symmetry, the other is with the coupling\nconstants based on SU(3) (flavor) symmetry. For the latter case, we use the\nlatest Nijmegen (ESC08) model. Then, it is very remarkable that the particle\ncomposition of the core matter in SU(3) symmetry is completely different from\nthat in SU(6) symmetry. In SU(6) symmetry, all octet baryons appear in the\ndensity region below $\\sim 1.2$ fm$^{-3}$, while, in the ESC08 model, only the\n\\Xi^- hyperon is produced. Furthermore, the medium modification of the internal\nbaryon structure hardens the equation of state for the core matter.

The results are then\ncompared either to particle-particle random phase approximation (ppRPA) in the\nnormal phase or quasi-particle random phase approximation (QRPA) in the\nsuperfluid phase. We show that both ppRPA and QRPA are globally well\nreproducing the exact case although some differences are seen in the superfluid\ncase. In particular the QRPA overestimates the pair transfer probabilities to\nexcited states in the vicinity of the normal-superfluid phase transition, which\nmight explain the difficult in detecting collective pairing phenomena as for\nexample the Giant Pairing Vibration. The shortcoming of QRPA can be traced back\nto the breaking of particle number that is used to incorporate pairing. A\nmethod, based on direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the space of two\nquasi-particle projected onto good particle number is shown to improve the\ndescription of pair transfer probabilities in superfluid systems. \n\n"}

The majority of the clusters in our sample\nhave prominent X-ray cavities embedded in the surrounding hot atmospheres,\nwhich we use to estimate mean jet power and average accretion rate onto the\nSMBHs over the past several hundred Myr. We find that ~50% of the sample have\ndetectable nuclear X-ray emission. The nuclear X-ray luminosity is correlated\nwith average accretion rate determined using X-ray cavities, which is\nconsistent with the hypothesis that nuclear X-ray emission traces ongoing\naccretion. The results imply that jets in systems that have experienced recent\nAGN outbursts, in the last ~10^7yr, are `on' at least half of the time. Nuclear\nX-ray sources become more luminous with respect to the mechanical jet power as\nthe mean accretion rate rises. We show that nuclear radiation exceeds the jet\npower when the mean accretion rate rises above a few percent of the Eddington\nrate, where the AGN apparently transitions to a quasar. The nuclear X-ray\nemission from three objects (A2052, Hydra A, M84) varies by factors of 2-10 on\ntimescales of 6 months to 10 years.

This work follows previous\nattempts to explain this asymmetry with an exospheric outflow or a bow shock,\ninduced by a planetary magnetic field, and provides a numerical solution of the\nearly-ingress, though we did not perform any radiative transfer calculation. We\nperformed pure 3D gas dynamic simulations of the plasma interaction between\nWASP-12b and its host star, and describe the flow pattern in the system.

Due to the conservation of the angular momentum, the flow to the L1\npoint is deflected in the direction of the planet's orbital motion, while the\nflow towards L2 is deflected in the opposite direction, resulting in a\nnon-axisymmetric envelope, surrounding the planet.

The newly arising singularities may\nrepresent true endpoints of the evolution or allow for the extension of\ngeodesics through them. In the latter case the components of the Riemann tensor\nrepresenting tidal forces diverge. Sudden Future Singularities (SFS) occur at\nfinite time, finite scale factor and finite Hubble parameter, only the\ndeceleration parameter diverges. The energy density of a perfect fluid is\nregular and its pressure diverges at the SFS. A particular SFS, the Big Brake\noccurs when the energy density vanishes and the expansion arrives at a full\nstop at the singularity. Such scenarios are generated by either a particular\nscalar field (the tachyon field) or the anti-Chaplygin gas. By adding matter to\nthese models, an unwanted feature appears: at the finite scale factor of the\nSFS the energy density of matter remains finite, implying (for a spatially flat\nuniverse) a finite Hubble parameter, hence finite expansion rate, rather then\nfull stop. The universe would further expand through the singularity, this\nnevertheless seems forbidden as the energy density of the tachyonic field /\nanti-Chaplygin gas would become ill-defined. This paradox is relieved in the\ncase of the anti-Chaplygin gas by redefining its energy density and pressure in\nterms of distributions peaked on the singularity. The regular cosmological\nquantities, continuous across the SFS are the energy density and the square of\nthe Hubble parameter; those allowing for a jump at the SFS are the Hubble\nparameter and expansion rate (both being mirror-symmetric).

The retardation\nspectrometer aSPECT consists, inter alia, of a superconducting magnet system\nthat produces a strong longitudinal magnetic field of up to 6.2T. In order not\nto disturb other experiments in the vicinity of aSPECT, we had to develop a\nmagnetic field return yoke for the magnet system. While the return yoke must\nreduce the stray magnetic field, the internal magnetic field and its\nhomogeneity should not be affected. As in many cases, the magnetic shielding\nfor aSPECT must manage with limited space. In addition, we must ensure that the\nadditional magnetic forces on the magnet coils are not destructive.

Aims: We aim at deriving accurate abundances for a\nlarge range of elements in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (NGC 104) to add new\nconstraints to the pollution scenarios for this particular cluster, expanding\nthe range of previously derived element abundances. Methods: Using tailored 1D\nLTE atmospheric models together with a combination of equivalent width\nmeasurements, LTE, and NLTE synthesis we derive stellar parameters and element\nabundances from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of 13 red giant\nstars near the tip of the RGB.

Nevertheless, companions at separations between 1 and 100\nmas remain mostly unknown due to intrinsic observational limitations. [...] The\nSouthern MAssive Stars at High angular resolution survey (SMASH+) was designed\nto fill this gap by providing the first systematic interferometric survey of\nGalactic massive stars. We observed 117 O-type stars with VLTI/PIONIER and 162\nO-type stars with NACO/SAM, respectively probing the separation ranges 1-45 and\n30-250mas and brightness contrasts of Delta H < 4 and Delta H < 5. Taking\nadvantage of NACO's field-of-view, we further uniformly searched for visual\ncompanions in an 8''-radius down to Delta H = 8. This paper describes the\nobservations and data analysis, reports the discovery of almost 200 new\ncompanions in the separation range from 1mas to 8'' and presents the catalog of\ndetections, including the first resolved measurements of over a dozen known\nlong-period spectroscopic binaries.\n  Excluding known runaway stars for which no companions are detected, 96\nobjects in our main sample (DEC < 0 deg; H<7.5) were observed both with PIONIER\nand NACO/SAM.

One of the most commonly used ways to remove the dust foreground\nis to extrapolate the polarized dust emission signal from frequencies where it\ndominates (e.g., ~ 350 GHz) to frequencies commonly targeted by cosmic\nmicrowave background experiments (e.g., ~150 GHz).

The method is based on comparison of detector signals\nwith results stored in a library of synchronized model signals registered for a\nset of well-defined positions of scintillation points. The hit position is\nreconstructed as the one corresponding to the signal from the library which is\nmost similar to the measurement signal.

A degree of similarity of measured and model signals is\ndefined as the distance between points representing the measurement- and\nmodel-signal in the multi-dimensional measurement space.

In measurements of\nthe basic weak muon capture reaction on the proton to determine the\npseudoscalar coupling g_P, capture occurs from both atomic and molecular\nstates. Thus knowledge of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ is required for a correct\ninterpretation of these experiments.\n  Purpose: Recently the MuCap experiment has measured the capture rate\n\\Lambda_S from the singlet p\\mu\\ atom, employing a low density active target to\nsuppress pp\\mu\\ formation (PRL 110, 12504 (2013)). Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm\nof argon, a competing process to pp\\mu\\ formation was introduced, which allowed\nthe extraction of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ from the observed time distribution of decay\nelectrons.\n  Results: The pp\\mu\\ formation rate was measured as \\lambda_pp\\mu = (2.01 +-\n0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1.

J-PARC is the most-intense hadron-beam facility in the\nhigh-energy region above multi-GeV, and spin physics will be investigated by\nusing secondary beams of kaons, pions, neutrinos, muons, and antiproton as well\nas the primary-beam proton. In particle physics, spin topics are on muon $g-2$,\nmuon and neutron electric dipole moments, and time-reversal violation\nexperiment in a kaon decay. Here, we focus more on hadron-spin physics as for\nfuture projects. For example, generalized parton distributions (GPDs) could be\ninvestigated by using pion and proton beams, whereas they are studied by the\nvirtual Compton scattering at lepton facilities. The GPDs are key quantities\nfor determining the three-dimensional picture of hadrons and for finding the\norigin of the nucleon spin including partonic orbital-angular-momentum\ncontributions. In addition, polarized parton distributions and various hadron\nspin topics should be possible by using the high-momentum beamline. The\nstrangeness contribution to the nucleon spin could be also investigated in\nprinciple with the neutrino beam with a near detector facility. \n\n"}

Gaseous Xe has intrinsic advantages when compared to\nLiquid Xe, specifically, tracking capability and better energy resolution for\ndouble beta decay searches. The performance of gaseous Xe can be further\nimproved by molecular additives such as trimethylamine(TMA), which are expected\nto (1) cool down the ionization electrons, (2) convert Xe excitation energy to\nTMA ionizations through Penning transfer, and (3) produce scintillation and\nelectroluminescence light in a more easily detectable wavelength (300 nm).\nThese features may provide better tracking and energy resolution for\ndouble-beta decay searches.

(1) The linear growth rate of matter\ndensity fluctuations is generally suppressed compared to $\\Lambda$CDM at\nintermediate redshifts ($0.5 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 1$), despite the introduction\nof an attractive long-range scalar force. This is due to the fact that, in\nself-accelerating models, the background gravitational coupling weakens at\nintermediate redshifts, over-compensating the effect of the attractive scalar\nforce. (2) At higher redshifts, the opposite happens; we identify a period of\nsuper-growth when the linear growth rate is larger than that predicted by\n$\\Lambda$CDM. (3) The gravitational slip parameter $\\eta$ - the ratio of the\nspace part of the metric perturbation to the time part - is bounded from above.\nFor Brans-Dicke-type theories $\\eta$ is at most unity.

Recent observations of long-lasting X-ray\nafterglows of SGRBs challenge standard paradigms and indicate that in a large\nfraction of events a long-lived neutron star (NS) may be formed rather than a\nblack hole. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these afterglows is\nnecessary in order to address the open questions concerning the nature of SGRB\ncentral engines. However, recent theoretical progress has been hampered by the\nfact that the timescales of interest for the afterglow emission are\ninaccessible to numerical relativity simulations. Here we present a detailed\nmodel to bridge the gap between numerical simulations of the merger process and\nthe relevant timescales for the afterglows, assuming that the merger results in\na long-lived NS. This model is formulated in terms of a set of coupled\ndifferential equations that follow the evolution of the post-merger system and\npredict its electromagnetic (EM) emission in a self-consistent way, starting\nfrom initial data that can be extracted from BNS merger simulations and taking\ninto account the most relevant radiative processes. Moreover, the model can\naccomodate the collapse of the remnant NS at any time during the evolution as\nwell as different scenarios for the prompt SGRB emission. A second major reason\nof interest for BNS mergers is that they are considered the most promising\nsource of gravitational waves (GWs) for detection with the advanced\nground-based detector network LIGO/Virgo coming online this year.\nMultimessenger astronomy with joint EM and GW observations of the merger and\npost-merger phase can greatly enhance the scientific output of either type of\nobservation.

Liquid\nargon had a minor (56 ppm) admixture of nitrogen, which allowed to understand,\ninter alia, the effect of N2 doping on the EL mechanism in rare-event\nexperiments using two-phase Ar detectors.

The EL gap was optically read out in the Vacuum\nUltraviolet (VUV), near 128 nm (Ar excimer emission), and in the near\nUltraviolet (UV), at 300-450 nm (N2 Second Positive System emission), via\ncryogenic PMTs and a Geiger-mode APD (GAPD).

The high-resolution (R ~ 23,000), near infrared (H-band, 1.5-1.7\nmicron) APOGEE spectra provide measurements of the stellar atmospheric\nparameters (temperature, surface gravity, [M/H], and [alpha/M]). Due to the\nsmaller uncertainties in surface gravity possible with high-resolution spectra\nand accurate Hipparcos distance measurements, we are able to calculate the\nstellar masses to within 40%. For red giants, the relatively rapid evolution of\nstars up the red giant branch allows the age to be constrained based on the\nmass. We examine methods of estimating age using both the mass-age relation\ndirectly and a Bayesian isochrone matching of measured parameters, assuming a\nconstant star formation history (SFH). To improve the prior on the SFH, we use\na hierarchical modeling approach to constrain the parameters of a model SFH\nfrom the age probability distribution functions of the data. The results of an\nalpha dependent Gaussian SFH model shows a clear relation between age and\n[alpha/M] at all ages. Using this SFH model as the prior for an empirical\nBayesian analysis, we construct a full age probability distribution function\nand determine ages for individual stars. The age-metallicity relation is flat,\nwith a slight decrease in [M/H] at the oldest ages and a ~ 0.5 dex spread in\nmetallicity. For stars with ages < 1 Gyr we find a smaller spread, consistent\nwith radial migration having a smaller effect on these young stars than on the\nolder stars. \n\n"}

This device will rely on the intrinsic ion back flow (IBF)\nsuppression of Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGD) based technology in\nparticular the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM).

Put simply, the TBTF problem consists of the fact that it is\ndifficult to explain both the measured kinematics of dwarfs and their observed\nnumber density within the LCDM framework. The most popular proposed solutions\nto the problem involve baryonic feedback processes. For example, reionization\nand baryon depletion can decrease the abundance of halos that are expected to\nhost dwarf galaxies. Moreover, feedback related to star formation can alter the\ndark matter density profile in the central regions of low-mass halos. In this\narticle we assess the TBTF problem for field dwarfs, taking explicitly into\naccount the baryonic effects mentioned above. We find that 1) reionization\nfeedback cannot resolve the TBTF problem on its own, because the halos in\nquestion are too massive to be affected by it, and that 2) the degree to which\nprofile modification can be invoked as a solution to the TBTF problem depends\non the radius at which galactic kinematics are measured. Based on a literature\nsample of about 90 dwarfs with interferometric observations in the 21cm line of\natomic hydrogen (HI), we conclude that the TBTF problem persists despite\nbaryonic effects. However, the preceding statement assumes that the sample\nunder consideration is representative of the general population of field\ndwarfs. In addition, the unexplained excess of dwarf galaxies in LCDM could be\nas small as a factor of ~ 1.8, given the current uncertainties in the\nmeasurement of the galactic velocity function. Both of these caveats highlight\nthe importance of upcoming uniform surveys with HI interferometers for\nadvancing our understanding of the issue. \n\n"}

We explain why asymmetric\ncluster states are strongly excited by the isoscalar dipole transition. We also\nprovide a theoretical prediction of the isoscalar dipole transitions in\n$^{20}{\\rm Ne}$ and $^{44}{\\rm Ti}$.

The Standard Model predicts a small parity-violating asymmetry\nof scattering rates between electron right and left helicity states due to the\nweak interaction. An initial result using 4% of the data was published in\nOctober 2013 with a measured parity-violating asymmetry of $-279\\pm\n35(\\text{stat})\\pm 31$ (syst) parts per billion (ppb). This asymmetry, along\nwith other data from parity-violating electron scattering experiments, provided\nthe world's first determination of the weak charge of the proton. The weak\ncharge of the proton was found to be $Q_W^p=0.064\\pm0.012$, in agreement with\nthe Standard Model prediction of $Q_W^p(SM)=0.0708\\pm0.0003$.\n  The results of the full dataset are expected to decrease the statistical\nerror from the initial publication by a factor of 4-5.

In order to estimate the frequency of these\nvaluable systems, it is essential to account for the unique geometric\nprobabilities of detecting multiple transiting extrasolar planets around the\nsame parent star. In order to improve on previous studies that used numerical\nmethods, we have constructed an efficient, semi-analytical algorithm called\nCORBITS which, given a collection of conjectured exoplanets orbiting a star,\ncomputes the probability that any particular group of exoplanets can be\nobserved to transit. The algorithm applies theorems of elementary differential\ngeometry to compute the areas bounded by circular curves on the surface of a\nsphere (see Ragozzine & Holman 2010). The implemented algorithm is more\naccurate and orders of magnitude faster than previous algorithms, based on\ncomparisons with Monte Carlo simulations. We use CORBITS to show that the\npresent solar system would only show a maximum of 3 transiting planets, but\nthat this varies over time due to dynamical evolution. We also used CORBITS to\ngeometrically debias the period ratio and mutual Hill sphere distributions of\nKepler's multi-transiting planet candidates, which results in shifting these\ndistributions towards slightly larger values.

The distributions of the obtained properties and their\ninterrelations (e.g. mass-metallicity and SFR-M$_{\\star}$ relations) are\ncompared to samples of field star-forming galaxies.We find that LGRB hosts at z\n< 1 have on average lower SFRs than if they were direct star-formation tracers.\nBy directly comparing metallicity distributions of LGRB hosts and star-forming\ngalaxies, we find a good match between the two populations up to Z $\\sim\n8.4-8.5$, after which the paucity of metal-rich LGRB hosts becomes apparent.\nThe LGRB host galaxies of our complete sample are not inconsistent with the\nmass-metallicity relation at similar mean redshift and stellar masses.

We find a hint of increased incidence of starburst\ngalaxies in the Swift/BAT6 z < 1 sample with respect to that of a field\nstar-forming population. Given that the SFRs are low on average, the latter is\nascribed to low stellar masses.

As part of the CALYPSO IRAM Large Program, we have\nobtained observations of C$^{18}$O, N$_2$H$^+$ and CH$_3$OH towards nearby\nClass 0 protostars with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer at\nsub-arcsecond resolution.

We observe an anti-correlation of C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ in NGC\n1333-IRAS4A, NGC 1333-IRAS4B, L1157, and L1448C, with N$_2$H$^+$ forming a ring\naround the centrally peaked C$^{18}$O emission due to N$_2$H$^+$ being\nchemically destroyed by CO. The emission regions of models and observations\nmatch for a CO binding energy of 1200 K, which is higher than the binding\nenergy of pure CO ices ($\\sim$855 K). Furthermore, we find very low CO\nabundances inside the snow lines in our sources, about an order of magnitude\nlower than the total CO abundance observed in the gas on large scales in\nmolecular clouds before depletion sets in. Conclusions. The high CO binding\nenergy may hint at CO being frozen out in a polar ice environment like\namorphous water ice or in non-polar CO$_2$-rich ice. The low CO abundances are\ncomparable to values found in protoplanetary disks, which may indicate an\nevolutionary scenario where these low values are already established in the\nprotostellar phase.

The creation mechanism makes the vector bosons' energy spectral\ndensity $\\rho_{cdm}/\\Delta E$ very high. Therefore, the dark electric dipole\ntransition rate in atoms is boosted if the energy gap between atomic states\nequals the mass of the vector bosons. By using the Zeeman effect, the energy\ngap between the 2S state and the 2P state in hydrogen atoms or hydrogen like\nions can be tuned. The $2S$ state can be populated with electrons due to its\nrelatively long life, which is about $1/7$s. When the energy gap between the\nsemi-ground $2S$ state and the 2P state matches the mass of the cosmic vector\nbosons, induced transitions occur and the 2P state subsequently decays into the\n1S state.

The dataset includes four sources with integrated steep radio\nspectra and seven with flat radio spectra. A total of 25 radio jet features are\npresent in this sample. We apply a Bayesian multi-scale image reconstruction\nmethod to detect and measure the X-ray emission from the jets. We compute\ndeviations from a baseline model that does not include the jet, and compare\nobserved X-ray images with those computed with simulated images where no jet\nfeatures exist. This allows us to compute p-value upper bounds on the\nsignificance that an X- ray jet is detected in a pre-determined region of\ninterest.

Therefore, a demonstrator setup using coplanar-grid CdZnTe\ndetectors is operated at the LNGS underground laboratory. In this work, the\ndemonstrator was commissioned and completed, which is discussed extensively.\nThe demonstrator works reliably and collects low-background physics data. One\nresult of the analysis of the data is that surface events are the dominating\nbackground component. To better understand and possibly discriminate this\nbackground, surface events were studied in detail. This was done mainly using\nlaboratory measurements. For a better interpretation of these measurements,\nsimulations of particle trajectories and ranges were done. The surface\nsensitivity tests showed large differences between the individual detectors.\nOften, a dead-layer was determined, especially at the surfaces where the\nnon-collecting anode (NCA) is the outermost anode rail. Due to this, the\nsensitivity of the surfaces where the collecting anode (CA) is adjacent was\ntypically about a factor of three larger than the NCA sensitivity. A comparison\nof the pulse shape analysis methods LSE and A/E was done. Laboratory\nmeasurements indicate, that the latter performs better. Alpha scanning\nmeasurements were done to spatially investigate the surface sensitivity.\nPlausible variations were measured. However, no hints were found how to improve\nthe surface event recognition. The instrumentation of the guard ring, which\nsurrounds the anode structure, was tested and improved the surface event\ndiscrimination significantly. The fraction of surviving alpha events was at a\nper-mill level. Important steps for a future large-scale COBRA experiment are\ndiscussed briefly, mainly the use of an integrated read-out system.

Albeit the result obtained is formally at\nnext-to-leading order in the CGC power counting, it provides the dominant\ncontribution for central rapidities.

This background becomes dominant in a kiloton-scale\nliquid-scintillator detector deep underground and is usually considered as\nirreducible due to an overlap in deposited energy with the signal.

We also present updated\nlimits from the Fermi/LAT using the new `Pass 8' calibration and approximately\n30% more time on source. With these deeper limits we rule out the IC/CMB model\nat the 8.7 sigma level. Finally, we demonstrate that complete knowledge of the\nsynchrotron SED is critical in evaluating the IC/CMB model. \n\n"}

Our\nsample consists of $\\approx 18000$ galaxies, allowing us to probe galaxies with\n$0.1 \\lesssim \\mathrm{SFR} \\lesssim 100\\ M_\\odot\\ \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and/or\n$10^8 \\lesssim M_* \\lesssim 10^{11}\\ M_{\\odot}$. We use sample-mean BHAR to\napproximate long-term average BHAR. Our sample-mean BHARs are derived from the\n$Chandra$ Deep Field-South 7 Ms observations, while the SFRs and $M_*$ have\nbeen estimated by the CANDELS team through SED fitting. The average BHAR is\ncorrelated positively with both SFR and $M_*$, and the BHAR-SFR and BHAR-$M_*$\nrelations can both be described acceptably by linear models with a slope of\nunity. However, BHAR appears to be correlated more strongly with $M_*$ than\nSFR. This result indicates that $M_*$ is the primary host-galaxy property\nrelated to black-hole growth, and the apparent BHAR-SFR relation is largely a\nsecondary effect due to the star-forming main sequence. Among our sources,\nmassive galaxies ($M_* \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$) have significantly higher\nBHAR/SFR ratios than less-massive galaxies, indicating the former have higher\nblack-hole fueling efficiency and/or higher SMBH occupation fraction than the\nlatter. Our results can naturally explain the observed proportionality between\n$M_{\\rm BH}$ and $M_*$ for local giant ellipticals, and suggest their $M_{\\rm\nBH}/M_*$ is higher than that of local star-forming galaxies. Among local\nstar-forming galaxies, massive systems might have higher $M_{\\rm BH}/M_*$\ncompared to dwarfs. \n\n"}

However, it cannot be trusted at low energies, e.g. well below\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}} \\approx 50$ GeV for central Au+Au collisions, when\n$\\tau_0$ is smaller than the finite time it takes for the two nuclei to cross\neach other. Here I extend the Bjorken formula by including the finite time\nduration of the initial energy production. Analytical solutions for the formed\nenergy density in the central spacetime-rapidity region are derived for several\ntime profiles. Compared to the Bjorken formula at low energies, the maximum\nenergy density reached is much lower, increases much faster with the collision\nenergy, and is much less sensitive to the uncertainty of the formation time,\nwhile the energy density time evolution is much longer.

For low-density materials, BUGS is able to radio-assay to specific\nactivities down to 3.6 mBq/kg for 234Th and 6.6 mBq/kg for 210Pb both of which\nhave uncovered some significant equilibrium breaks in the 238U chain. In denser\nmaterials, where gamma-ray self-absorption increases, sensitivity is\ndemonstrated to specific activities of 0.9 mBq/kg for 226Ra, 1.1 mBq/kg for 228\nRa, 0.3 mBq/kg for 224Ra, and 8.6 mBq/kg for 40K with all upper limits at a 90%\nconfidence level. These meet the requirements of most screening campaigns\npresently under way for rare-event search experiments, such as the LUX-ZEPLIN\n(LZ) dark matter experiment. We also highlight the ability of the BEGe detector\nto probe the X-ray fluorescence region which can be important to identify the\npresence of radioisotopes associated with neutron production; this is of\nparticular relevance in experiments sensitive to nuclear recoils. \n\n"}

Most of the previous work is based on density fields on grids. By\nsmoothing into fields, we lose information about galaxy properties like shape\nor luminosity. Lack of mathematical model also limits our understanding of\npercolation analysis. In order to overcome these difficulties, we have studied\npercolation analysis based on discrete points. Using a Friends-of-Friends (FoF)\nalgorithm, we generate the S-bb relation, between the fractional mass of the\nlargest connected group (S) and the FoF linking length (bb). We propose a new\nmodel, the Probability Cloud Cluster Expansion Theory (PCCET) to relate the\nS-bb relation with correlation functions. We show that the S-bb relation\nreflects a combination of all orders of correlation functions. Using N-body\nsimulation, we find that the S-bb relation is robust against redshift\ndistortion and incompleteness in observation. From the Bolshoi simulation, with\nHalo Abundance Matching (HAM), we have generated a mock galaxy catalogue. Good\nmatching of the projected two-point correlation function with observation is\nconfirmed. However, comparing the mock catalogue with the latest galaxy\ncatalogue from SDSS DR12, we have found significant differences in their S-bb\nrelations. This indicates that the mock galaxy catalogue cannot accurately\nretain higher order correlation functions than the two-point correlation\nfunction, which reveals the limit of HAM method. As a new measurement, S-bb\nrelation is applicable to a wide range of data types, fast to compute, robust\nagainst redshift distortion and incompleteness, and it contains information of\nall orders of correlation function. \n\n"}

An optical unit consists of a flat, circular acrylic plate,\ncoated with tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB), positioned near the photocathode of a\n20.2-cm diameter photomultiplier tube. The plate converts the ultra-violet\nscintillation photons from liquid argon into visible-spectrum photons to which\nthe cryogenic phototubes are sensitive. The GQE is the convolution of the\nefficiency of the plates that convert the 128 nm scintillation light from\nliquid argon to visible light, the efficiency of the shifted light to reach the\nphotocathode, and the efficiency of the cryogenic photomultiplier tube. We\ndevelop a GEANT4-based model of the optical unit, based on first principles,\nand obtain the range of probable values for the expected number of detected\nphotoelectrons ($N_{\\rm PE}$) given the known systematic errors on the\nsimulation parameters. We compare results from four measurements of the $N_{\\rm\nPE}$ determined using alpha-particle sources placed at two distances from a\nTPB-coated plate in a liquid argon cryostat test stand.

Our analysis of 2015-2017 data confirms the occurrence in January\n2017 of a new peak fitting in the previous trend. In addition, we identify\nsecondary peaks (\"twin peaks\") that occur in closely symmetric pairs on both\nsides of most main peaks, including the last one; their occurrence is supported\nby correlated X-ray outbursts. We stress that the above features strongly point\nto binary dynamics in a system of two black holes (BHs) of some 10^8 and 10^7\nM_sun. At periastron the smaller BH periodically stresses the jet j_1 launched\nby the heavier companion, and triggers MHD-kinetic tearing instabilities. These\nlead to magnetic reconnections and to acceleration of electrons that produce\nsynchrotron emission from the optical to X-ray bands, and inverse Compton\nscattering into the GeV range. For the origin of the twin peaks we discuss two\npossibilities: a single-jet model, based on added instabilities induced in j_1\nby the smaller companion BH on its inner orbital arc; and a two-jet model with\nthe smaller BH supporting its own, precessing jet j_2 that contributes lower,\nspecific GeV emissions. Such behaviors combining time stability with amplitude\nvariations betray plasma instabilities driven in either jet by binary dynamics,\nand can provide a double signature of the long-sought supermassive BH binaries. \n\n"}

These\nfields are self-similar over all length scales and characterised by a drift\nexponent $H$, which describes the structural roughness. Given that the\nstructure of molecular clouds and the initial structure of star clusters are\nalmost certainly linked, it would be advantageous to also apply this analysis\nto clusters. Currently, the structure of star clusters is often quantified by\napplying $\\mathcal{Q}$ analysis. $\\mathcal{Q}$ values from observed targets are\ninterpreted by comparing them with those from artificial clusters. These are\ntypically generated using a Box-Fractal (BF) or Radial Density Profile (RDP)\nmodel. We present a single cluster model, based on FBM, as an alternative to\nthese models. Here, the structure is parameterised by $H$, and the standard\ndeviation of the log-surface/volume density $\\sigma$. The FBM model is able to\nreproduce both centrally concentrated and substructured clusters, and is able\nto provide a much better match to observations than the BF model.

Also the UCN\ntransparency of the bulk sD_2 material must be high because crystal\ninhomogeneities limit the mean free path for elastic scattering and reduce the\nextraction efficiency. Observations at the UCN sources at Paul Scherrer\nInstitute and at Los Alamos National Laboratory consistently show a decrease of\nthe UCN yield with time of operation after initial preparation or later\ntreatment (`conditioning') of the sD_2.

Spiral arms can be\ndestabilised by the toroidal fields which cancel Coriolis force, i.e.\nmagneto-Jeans instability.

The objective of the upgrade is two-fold: i) an\nimprovement of the tracking precision and efficiency, in particular in the\nlow-momentum range; ii) an improvement of the readout capabilities of the\nexperiment, in order to fully exploit the luminosity for heavy ions envisaged\nafter LS2. The first goal will be achieved by replacing the Inner Tracking\nSystem with a new tracker, composed of seven layers of silicon pixel detectors.\nThe new tracker will be made up of about 25000 Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors\nwith fast readout, resulting in a material thickness reduced to 0.3% (inner\nlayers) - 1% (outer layers) of the radiation length and a granularity of\n$28\\times28$ $\\mu$m$^2$.

On an opposite energy and resolution scale, elastic\nelectron scattering experiments are used to extract the charge density and\ncharge radius of different nuclei. We show that even though the charge density\nhas no obvious connection with nuclear short-range correlations, it can be used\nto extract properties of such correlations. This is accomplished by using the\nnuclear contact formalism to derive a relation between the charge density and\nthe proton-proton nuclear contacts that describe the probability of two protons\nbeing at close proximity. With this relation, the values of the proton-proton\ncontacts are extracted for various nuclei using only the nuclear charge density\nand a solution of the two-nucleon Schroedinger equation as inputs. For\nsymmetric nuclei, the proton-neutron contacts can also be extracted from the\ncharge density. Good agreement is obtained with previous extractions of the\nnuclear contacts. These results imply that one can predict (with reasonably\ngood accuracy) the results of high-energy and large momentum-transfer\nelectron-scattering experiments and ab-initio calculations of high momentum\ntails using only experimental data of elastic scattering experiments. \n\n"}

Field-trapping mitigates\nthe problem of UCN loss on material surfaces, which caused the largest\ncorrection in prior neutron experiments using material bottles. However, the\nneutron dynamics in field traps differ qualitatively from those in material\nbottles. In the latter case, neutrons bounce off material surfaces with\nsignificant diffusivity and the population quickly reaches a static spatial\ndistribution with a density gradient induced by the gravitational potential. In\ncontrast, the field-confined UCN -- whose dynamics can be described by\nHamiltonian mechanics -- do not exhibit the stochastic behaviors typical of an\nideal gas model as observed in material bottles. In this report, we will\ndescribe our efforts to simulate UCN trapping in the UCN{\\tau}\nmagneto-gravitational trap. We compare the simulation output to the\nexperimental results to determine the parameters of the neutron detector and\nthe input neutron distribution. The tuned model is then used to understand the\nphase space evolution of neutrons observed in the UCN{\\tau} experiment. We will\ndiscuss the implications of chaotic dynamics on controlling the systematic\neffects, such as spectral cleaning and microphonic heating, for a successful\nUCN lifetime experiment to reach a 0.01% level of precision. \n\n"}

A break\nin the afterglow light curve is seen approximately 1 day from the onset of the\nburst. The light curve displays a significant deviation from a simple broken\npower-law with a bright 1.5 magnitude bump with a duration of 2-3 days.

First we use the requirement that burst sources must be\noptically thin to pair production by photon-photon collisions in order to\nproduce the observed nonthermal spectra. We derive probability distributions\nfor the minimum Lorentz expansion factor, the radiation energy, the maximum\nbaryonic mass, and the maximum surrounding gas density in the events, based on\n254 events from the second BATSE catalog. Secondly, the time variabilities of\nthe bursts in the BATSE catalog are used to place an upper bound on the\ncurvature radius of the emitting surface in the events. This is based on the\nrequirement that the emitting region seen by the observer must be sufficiently\nsmall to produce the observed variability without violating causality. Finally,\nwe discuss the association of cosmological GRB with galaxies. We consider eight\nbright and well-localized bursts detected by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, whose\npositional error boxes contain no bright galaxies. Using the local luminosity\nfunction of galaxies, we calculate the probability for not seeing the GRB host\ngalaxy. This probability tends to increase as the width of the GRB luminosity\nfunction increases.

Thus, large mass\nratio of dark matter (DM) to baryonic matter (i.e., large $M_{\\rm vir}/L$) is\nrealized in a low-mass ($M_{\\rm vir}<10^8M_\\odot$) dSph through the gas\ndepletion, whereas $M_{\\rm vir}/L$ becomes lower in high-mass ($M_{\\rm\nvir}>10^8M_\\odot$) dSphs.

This paper calculates the known effects in more\ndetail and considers new sources of radiation, all based on spacecraft\nconstruction. These effects are then modelled over the duration of the\nexperiment. The model reproduces the acceleration from its appearance at a\nheliocentric distance of 5 AU to the last measurement at 71 AU to within 10\npercent. However, it predicts a larger decrease in acceleration between\nintervals I and III of the Pioneer 10 observations than is observed.

Condensate fluctuations can give rise to both adiabatic and\nisocurvature density perturbations and could be observable in future cosmic\nmicrowave experiments.
