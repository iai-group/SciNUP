Our main finding is that Coulomb interactions among\nthe electrons dominate the interference, even in a relatively large area FPI,\nleading to a strong dependence of the area enclosed by the interference loop on\nthe magnetic field. In particular, for a composite edge structure, with a few\nindependent edge channels propagating along the edge, interference of the\noutmost edge channel (belonging to the lowest Landau level) was insensitive to\nmagnetic field; suggesting a constant enclosed flux. However, when any of the\ninner edge channels interfered, the enclosed flux decreased when the magnetic\nfield increased. By intentionally varying the enclosed area with a biased\nmetallic gate and observing the periodicity of the interference pattern,\ncharges e (for integer filling factors) and e/3 (for a fractional filling\nfactor) were found to be expelled from the FPI.

Thus, the adiabaticity upon which the notion of quantum\nstatistics is defined, plays a fundamental role in defining the non-Abelian\nanyons. We study the non-adiabatic effects in braidings of Ising-type anyons,\nnamely Majorana fermions in topological superconductors, using the formalism of\ntime-dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations.

We show that, as the number of control\npulses increases, the decoupling fidelity scaling differs qualitatively from\nthe predictions of the Magnus expansion, and explain the origin of this\ndifference. In particular, more advanced symmetrized or concatenated protocols\ndo not improve the DD performance. Next, we investigate the impact of the\nsystematic instrumental pulse errors in different periodic and aperiodic pulse\nsequences. The DD protocols with the single-axis control do not preserve all\nspin components in the presence of the pulse errors, and the two-axis control\nis needed. We demonstrate that the two-axis control sequence with the CPMG\ntiming is very robust with respect to the pulse errors. The impact of the pulse\nerrors can be diminished further by symmetrizing this protocol. For all\nprotocols studied here, we present a detailed account of the pulse error\nparameters which make strongest impact on the DD performance. In conclusion, we\ngive specific recommendations about choosing the decoupling protocol for the\nsystem under investigation. \n\n"}

It is shown that the VEV of the\ncharge density vanishes and the current density has nonzero expectation values\nfor the components along compact dimensions only. The latter are periodic odd\nfunctions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum. In\nthe region between the plates, the VEV of the fermionic current is decomposed\ninto pure topological, single plate and interference parts. For a massless\nfield the single plate part vanishes and the interference part is distributed\nuniformly. The corresponding results are generalized for conformally-flat\nspacetimes. Applications of the general formulas to finite-length carbon\nnanotubes are given within the framework of the Dirac model for quasiparticles\nin graphene. In the absence of the magnetic flux, two sublattices of the\nhoneycomb graphene lattice yield opposite contributions and the fermionic\ncurrent vanishes. A magnetic flux through the cross section of the nanotube\nbreaks the symmetry allowing the current to flow along the compact dimension. \n\n"}

Measuring a quantum system\ntypically steers it towards a classical state, destroying any initial quantum\nsuperposition and any entanglement with other quantum systems. Remarkably, the\nmeasurement of a shared property between non-interacting quantum systems can\ngenerate entanglement starting from an uncorrelated state. Of special interest\nin quantum computing is the parity measurement, which projects a register of\nquantum bits (qubits) to a state with an even or odd total number of\nexcitations. Crucially, a parity meter must discern the two parities with high\nfidelity while preserving coherence between same-parity states. Despite\nnumerous proposals for atomic, semiconducting, and superconducting qubits,\nrealizing a parity meter creating entanglement for both even and odd\nmeasurement results has remained an outstanding challenge. We realize a\ntime-resolved, continuous parity measurement of two superconducting qubits\nusing the cavity in a 3D circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture\nand phase-sensitive parametric amplification.

Upon injection of\ntwo photons (corresponding to weak coherent driving), the resonance\nfluorescence and photon correlations are shaped by the effective qubit\ntransition frequencies and decay rates, which are substantially modified by\ninterference effects. In contrast to the well-known result in an infinite\nwaveguide, photons reflected by a single 2LS coupled to a semi-infinite\nwaveguide are initially bunched, a result that can be simply explained by\nstimulated emission. As the number of 2LS increases (up to 10 are considered\nhere), rapid oscillations build up in the correlations that persist for a very\nlong time. For instance, when the incoming photons are slightly detuned, the\ntransmitted photons in the infinite waveguide are highly antibunched.

To arrive at\nthis result, we derive the leading corrections to the lumped-element Josephson\nparametric amplifier of three common pumping schemes: monochromatic current\npump, bichromatic current pump, and monochromatic flux pump. We show that the\nleading correction for the last two schemes is a single Kerr-type quartic term,\nwhile the first scheme contains additional cubic terms.

Tilt of Dirac cone can be realized in a number of\nmaterials, including deformed graphene, surface state of topological\ncrystalline insulator, and certain organic compound. We study how Dirac cone\ntilting affects the low-energy properties by presenting a renormalization group\nanalysis of the Coulomb interaction and quenched disorder. Random scalar\npotential or random vector potential along the tilting direction cannot exist\non its own as it always dynamically generates a new type of disorder, which\ndominates at low energies and turns the system into a compressible diffusive\nmetal. Consequently, the fermions acquire a finite disorder scattering rate.\nMoreover, the isolated band-touching point is replaced by a bulk Fermi arc in\nthe Brillouin zone. These results are not qualitatively changed when the\nCoulomb interaction is incorporated. In comparison, random mass and random\nvector potential along the non-tilting direction can exist individually,\nwithout generating other types of disorder. They both suppress tilt at low\nenergies, and do not produce bulk Fermi arc. Upon taking the Coulomb\ninteraction into account, the system enters into a stable quantum critical\nstate, in which the fermion field acquires a finite anomalous dimension but the\ndynamical exponent $z=1$. These results indicate that Dirac cone tilt does lead\nto some qualitatively different low-energy properties comparing to the untilted\nsystem. \n\n"}

A quantum channel\ntransforms POVM's into POVM's, generally irreversibly, thus loosing some of the\ninformation retrieved from the measurement. This poses the problem of which\nPOVM's are \"undisturbed\", namely they are not irreversibly connected to another\nPOVM. We will call such POVM clean. In a sense, the clean POVM's would be\n\"perfect\", since they would not have any additional \"extrinsical\" noise. Quite\nunexpectedly, it turns out that such cleanness property is largely unrelated to\nthe convex structure of POVM's, and there are clean POVM's that are not\nextremal and vice-versa. In this paper we solve the cleannes classification\nproblem for number n of outcomes n<=d (d dimension of the Hilbert space), and\nwe provide a a set of either necessary or sufficient conditions for n>d, along\nwith an iff condition for the case of informationally complete POVM's for\nn=d^2. \n\n"}

This thesis concerns various related aspects of\nquantum information processing with single photons. Firstly, we demonstrate\nN-photon entanglement generation through a generalised N X N symmetric beam\nsplitter known as the Bell multiport. A wide variety of 4-photon entangled\nstates as well as the N-photon W-state can be generated with an unexpected\nnon-monotonic decreasing probability of success with N. We also show how the\nsame setup can be used to generate multiatom entanglement. A further study of\nmultiports also leads us to a multiparticle generalisation of the\nHong-Ou-Mandel dip which holds for all Bell multiports of even number of input\nports. Next, we demonstrate a generalised linear optics based photon filter\nthat has a constant success probability regardless of the number of photons\ninvolved. This filter has the highest reported success probability and is\ninterferometrically robust. Finally, we demonstrate how repeat-until-success\nquantum computing can be performed with two distant nodes with unit success\nprobability using only linear optics resource. We further show that using\nnon-identical photon sources, robustness can still be achieved, an illustration\nof the nature and advantages of measurement-based quantum computation. A direct\napplication to the same setup leads naturally to arbitrary multiphoton state\ngeneration on demand. Finally, we demonstrate how polarisation entanglement of\nphotons can be detected from the emission of two atoms in a Young's double-slit\ntype experiment without linear optics, resulting in both atoms being also\nmaximally entangled. \n\n"}

In previous work we proved that the maximal entanglement is reached to\na fixed arbitrary accuracy within $O(N^3)$ steps, where $N$ is the total number\nof qubits. Here we provide a detailed and more pedagogical proof. We\ndemonstrate that one can use the so-called stabilizer gates to simulate this\nprocess efficiently on a classical computer. Furthermore, we discuss three ways\nof identifying the transition from the phase of rapid spread of entanglement to\nthe stationary phase: (i) the time when saturation of the maximal entanglement\nis achieved, (ii) the cut-off moment, when the entanglement probability\ndistribution is practically stationary, and (iii) the moment block entanglement\nscales exhibits volume scaling.
