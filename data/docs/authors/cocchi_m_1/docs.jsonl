Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

It was originally estimated that only one or two\nof the essential evolutionary steps had to have been hard in this sense, but it\nhas become apparent that this figure may need upward revision, because recent\nstudies of climatic instability suggest that the possible future duration of\nour biologically favourable environment may be shorter than had been supposed,\nonly about one Giga year rather than five. On the basis of the statistical\nrequirement of roughly equal spacing between hard steps, it is argued that the\nbest fit with the fossil record is now obtainable by postulating the number of\nhard steps to be five, if our evolution was exclusively terrestrial, or six if,\nas now seems very plausible, the first step occurred on Mars. \n\n"}

Indeed, merely a single case of a star-planet-disk\nsystem has previously been detected at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths.\nConsequently, one of our aims is to understand the reasons for these poor\nstatistics, i.e., whether these results reflected the composition and/or the\nphysics of the planetary disks or were simply due to observational bias and\nselection effects. Finding more examples would be very significant. The\nselected target, q1 Eri, is a solar-type star, which was known to possess a\nplanet, q1 Eri b, and to exhibit excess emission at IRAS wavelengths, but had\nremained undetected in the millimeter regime. Therefore, submm flux densities\nwould be needed to better constrain the physical characteristics of the\nplanetary disk. Consequently, we performed submm imaging observations of q1\nEri. The detected dust toward q1 Eri at 870 micron exhibits the remarkable fact\nthat the entire SED, from the IR to mm-wavelengths, is fit by a single\ntemperature blackbody function (60 K). This would imply that the emitting\nregions are confined to a narrow region (ring) at radial distances much larger\nthan the orbital distance of q1 Eri b, and that the emitting particles are\nconsiderably larger than some hundred micron. However, the 870 micron source is\nextended, with a full-width-half-maximum of roughly 600 AU.

Such binaries form after major galaxy\nmergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering\nbecomes very inefficient at sub-parsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary\ndynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the orbits of binaries embedded within\ngeometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum\ntransport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated\nby disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good\nagreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation\nof eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e > 0.35. Accretion onto\nthe black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital\nfrequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of\nbinary decay that is possible without fragmentation occuring within the\nsurrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar\ndynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 10^5 < M/Msun < 10^8\nwe find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~\n0.01--0.1 pc, where the disc is optically thick. The minimum merger time scale\nis shorter than the Hubble time for M < 10^7 Msun.

Dark matter particles that end up within two virial\nradii of a Milky-Way-sized DM halo at $z=0$ have an approximately Gaussian\ndistribution in log(f) at early redshifts, but the distribution becomes\nincreasingly skewed at lower redshifts. The value corresponding to the peak of\nthe Gaussian decreases as the evolution progresses and is well described by a\npower-law in (1+z). The highest values of f are found at the centers of dark\nmatter halos and subhalos, where f can be an order of magnitude higher than in\nthe center of the main halo.

By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show that such discs fragment within a few thousand years, and\nproduce mainlybrown dwarf (BDs) stars, but also planetary mass (PM) stars and\nvery low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a\nfew Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these\ndiscs if they remain bound to the primary star.

For the respective scenarios, the lifetimes\nfor decaying dark matter are $\\Gamma^{-1} \\gtrsim 100$ Gyr and $ (f \\Gamma)\n^{-1} \\gtrsim 5.3 \\times 10^8$ Gyr (at 95.4% confidence level), where the\nphenomenological parameter $f$ is the fraction of the decay energy deposited in\nbaryonic gas. This allows us to constrain particle physics models with dark\nmatter candidates through investigation of dark matter decays into Standard\nModel particles via effective operators. For decaying dark matter of $\\sim 100$\nGeV mass, we found that the size of the coupling constant in the effective\ndimension-4 operators responsible for dark matter decay has to generically be $\n\\lesssim 10^{-22}$. We have also explored the implications of our analysis for\nrepresentative models in theories of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking,\nminimal supergravity and little Higgs. \n\n"}

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass. This model successfully\nreproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in the\ncomoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies.

In fact, the addition of a new contribution accounting for the\ngas can increase the statistical significance of the lensing model.

We further compactify one of the $(D-1)$ spatial\ndimensions on an $S^{1}/Z_{2}$ orbifold, and derive the gravitational and\nmatter field equations both in the bulk and on the branes. Then, we investigate\ntwo key issues in such a setup: (i) the radion stability and radion mass; and\n(ii) the localization of gravity, and the corresponding Kaluza-Klein (KK)\nmodes. We show explicitly that the radion is stable and its mass can be in the\norder of $GeV$. In addition, the gravity is localized on the visible brane, and\nits spectrum of the gravitational KK towers is discrete and can have a mass gap\nof $TeV$, too. The high order Yukawa corrections to the 4-dimensional Newtonian\npotential is exponentially suppressed, and can be negligible.

The origin of the radio emission is\nunclear,it could be due either to a jet, as in microquasars, or to the shock\nboundary between the Be star and a possible pulsar wind. We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before). We show that this result qualitatively\nand quantitatively agrees with the two-peak accretion/ejection model proposed\nin the past for LS I +61303. We conclude that the radio emission in LS I +61303\noriginates from a jet and suggest that the variable TeV emission comes from the\nusual Compton losses expected as an important by-product in the shock-in-jet\ntheory. \n\n"}

The local AGN luminosity\n  function Abstract: We present a determination of the local (z=0) luminosity function of\noptically selected type 1 (broad-line) Active Galactic Nuclei. Our primary\nresource is the Hamburg/ESO Survey (HES), which provides a well-defined sample\nof more than 300 optically bright AGN with redshifts z<0.3 and blue magnitudes\nB<17.5. AGN luminosities were estimated in two ways, always taking care to\nminimise photometric biases due to host galaxy light contamination. Firstly, we\nmeasured broad-band B_J (blue) magnitudes of the objects over small apertures\nof the size of the seeing disk. Secondly, we extracted H alpha and H beta broad\nemission line luminosities from the spectra which should be entirely free of\nany starlight contribution. The resulting AGN luminosity function (AGNLF) is\nconsistent with a single power law, also when considering the effects of number\ndensity evolution within the narrow redshift range. We compared our AGNLF with\nthe H alpha luminosity function of lower luminosity Seyfert 1 galaxies by Hao\net al.

From the combination of HES and SDSS\nsamples we constructed a single local AGNLF spanning more than 4 orders of\nmagnitude in luminosity.

Abstract: The observations show that less massive the galaxies are, the higher on\naverage is their specific star formation rate (SSFR = SFR/Ms, Ms is the stellar\nmass). Such a trend, called the 'SSFR downsizing' (SSFR-DS) phenomenon, is seen\nfor local and high-z (back to z~1-2) galaxy samples. We use observational data\nrelated only to disc galaxies and explore the average SSFR change with z for\ndifferent masses. For Ms in the range ~10^9.5-10^10.5 Msun, the SSFR increases\nwith (1+z) to a power that barely depends on Ms, and at all z's smaller\ngalaxies have ever higher SSFRs. The latter strongly disagree with the LCDM\nhierarchical mass accretion rates. By means of self-consistent models of disc\ngalaxy evolution inside growing LCDM halos, the effects that disc\nfeedback-driven outflows and gas re-accretion have on the galaxy SSFR histories\nare explored. The parameters of the outflow and re-accretion schemes are tuned\nto reproduce the z~0 Mh-Ms relation inferred from observations. In the case of\noutflows only, the SSFR of individual model galaxies is roughly proportional to\n(1+z)^2.2 for all the masses with a normalization factor that depends on mass\nas Ms^0.1, i.e more massive galaxies have slightly larger SSFRs, contrary to\nthe observed strong SSFR-DS trend. For the re-accretion cases, the dependence\non z remains approximately the same as without re-infall, but the correlation\non Ms even increases for most of the reasonable values of the model parameters.\nThe comparison of models and observations in the SSFR-Ms plane at z~0 shows the\ndivergent trend in SSFR as lower are the masses (upsizing vs downsizing). We\nexplain why the models show the reported trends, and conclude that the SSFR-DS\nfor low-mass galaxies poses a challenge for LCDM-based disc galaxy evolution\nmodels. (Abridged) \n\n"}

The BLR mass influx is sufficient to power the AGN. The\nincreasing blueshifting of lines with increasing ionization potential is a\nconsequence of scattering off infalling material.

The\ntechnical reason for this effect to occur is the property of Bogolubov's\ncoefficients which mix the positive and negative frequencies modes. The\ncorresponding mixture can not be avoided because the projections to positive\n-frequency modes with respect to Minkowski time t and positive -frequency modes\nwith respect to the Rindler observer's proper time \\eta are not equivalent. The\nexact cancellation of unphysical degrees of freedom which is maintained in\nMinkowski space can not hold in the Rindler space. In BRST approach this effect\nmanifests itself as the presence of BRST charge density in L and R parts.

The fast-evolving light curve soon after\nthe outbursts, the quasi-modulated light curve, the peak magnitude and the\noverall spectral properties are consistent with multiple episodes of\nvariability of an extremely active LBV. However, the widths of the spectral\nlines indicate unusually high wind velocities (1500-2800 km/s), similar to\nthose observed in Wolf-Rayet stars.

Using a set of collisionless N-body simulations, we investigate the\nefficiency of the tidal stirring mechanism. We explore a wide variety of dwarf\norbital configurations and initial structures and demonstrate that in most\ncases the disky dwarfs experience significant mass loss and their stellar\ncomponents undergo a dramatic morphological and dynamical transformation: from\ndisks to bars and finally to pressure-supported spheroidal systems with\nkinematic and structural properties akin to those of the classic dSphs in the\nLocal Group (LG). Our results suggest that such tidal transformations should be\ncommon occurrences within the currently favored cosmological paradigm and\nhighlight the key factor responsible for an effective metamorphosis to be the\nstrength of the tidal shocks at the pericenters of the orbit. We demonstrate\nthat the combination of short orbital times and small pericenters,\ncharacteristic of dwarfs being accreted at high redshift, induces the strongest\ntransformations. Our models also indicate that the transformation efficiency is\naffected significantly by the structure of the progenitor disky dwarfs. Lastly,\nwe find that the dwarf remnants satisfy the relation Vmax = \\sqrt{3} * sigma,\nwhere sigma is the 1D, central stellar velocity dispersion and Vmax is the\nmaximum halo circular velocity, with intriguing implications for the missing\nsatellites problem. Overall, we conclude that the action of tidal forces from\nthe hosts constitutes a crucial evolutionary mechanism for shaping the nature\nof dwarf galaxies in environments such as that of the LG. Environmental\nprocesses of this type should thus be included as ingredients in models of\ndwarf galaxy formation and evolution. \n\n"}

Finding the origin of this variability would constrain the still\nlargely unknown properties of this extraordinary object.

Optical spectroscopy of this object has suggested a distance of ~7\nkpc and an identification with a low mass X-ray binary. We instead use the\nX-ray data from 0.3-40 keV to identify the source as a bright intermediate\npolar (IP) with an estimate for the white dwarf mass of~0.60 M_solar. This\nidentification is supported by the presence of an iron triplet, the component\nlines of which are some of the strongest seen in IPs; and the signature of the\nspin period of the white dwarf at ~24 mins. We note that the lack of broad-band\nvariability may suggest that this object is a stream-fed IP, similar in many\nrespects to the well studied IP, V2400 Oph. Phase-binning has allowed us to\ncreate spectra corresponding to the peaks and troughs of the lightcurve from\nwhich we determine that the spectra appear harder in the troughs, consistent\nwith the behaviour of other IPs binned on their spin periods.

To illustrate applications of this to cosmology, we explicitly\ngive a dimensionless version of the parameters of the standard cosmological\nmodel, and describe the physics of Big Bang Neucleosynthesis and recombination\nin a dimensionless manner. The issue that appears to have been missed in many\nstudies is that in cosmology the strength of gravity is bound up in the\ncosmological equations, and the epoch at which we live is a crucial part of the\nmodel. We argue that it is useful to consider the hypothetical situation of\ncommunicating with another civilization (with entirely different units),\ncomparing only dimensionless constants, in order to decide if we live in a\nUniverse governed by precisely the same physical laws. In this thought\nexperiment, we would also have to compare epochs, which can be defined by\ngiving the value of any {\\it one} of the evolving cosmological parameters.

We assess\nthe possibility to use lensed SNe to put constraints on the mass models of\ngalaxy clusters and the Hubble parameter at high redshift. Due to the standard\ncandle nature of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), observational information on the\nlensing magnification from an intervening galaxy cluster can be used to\nconstrain the model for the cluster mass distribution. A statistical analysis\nusing parametric cluster models was performed to investigate the possible\nimprovements from lensed SNe Ia for the accurately modeled galaxy cluster A1689\nand the less well constrained cluster A2204. Time delay measurements obtained\nfrom SNe lensed by accurately modeled galaxy clusters can be used to measure\nthe Hubble parameter. For a survey of A1689 we estimate the expected rate of\ndetectable SNe Ia and of multiply imaged SNe. The velocity dispersion and core\nradius of the main cluster potential show strong correlations with the\npredicted magnifications and can therefore be constrained by observations of\nSNe Ia in background galaxies. This technique proves especially powerful for\ngalaxy clusters with only few known multiple image systems. The main\nuncertainty for measurements of the Hubble parameter from the time delay of\nstrongly lensed SNe is due to cluster model uncertainties. For the extremely\nwell modeled cluster A1689, a single time delay measurement could be used to\ndetermine the Hubble parameter with a precision of ~ 10%. We conclude that\nobservations of SNe Ia behind galaxy clusters can be used to improve the mass\nmodeling of the large scale component of galaxy clusters and thus the\ndistribution of dark matter.

To this aim, we integrate\nin time the equations of mass and energy conservation under self-regulated\ninstability of a two-component disc of gas and stars. The disc is assumed to be\ncontinuously fed by cold gas at the average cosmological rate. The gas forms\nstars and is partly driven away by stellar feedback. The gas and stars flow\ninward through the disc to a central bulge due to torques that drive angular\nmomentum outwards. The gravitational energy released by the mass inflow down\nthe gravitational potential gradient drives the disc turbulence that maintains\nthe disc unstable with a Toomre instability parameter Q~1, compensating for the\ndissipative losses of the gas turbulence and raising the stellar velocity\ndispersion. We follow the velocity dispersion of stars and gas as they heat and\ncool respectively and search for disc `stabilization', to be marked by a low\ngas velocity dispersion comparable to the speed of sound ~10 km/s. We vary the\nmodel parameters that characterize the accreted gas fraction, turbulence\ndissipation rate, star-formation rate, and stellar feedback. We find that as\nlong as the gas input roughly follows the average cosmological rate, the disc\ninstability is a robust phenomenon at high redshift till z~1, driven by the\nhigh surface density and high gas fraction due to the intense cosmological\naccretion. For a broad range of model parameter values, the discs tend to\n`stabilize' at z~0-0.5 as they become dominated by hot stars. When the model\nparameters are pushed to extreme values, the discs may stabilize as early as\nz~2, with the gas loss by strong outflows serving as the dominant stabilizing\nfactor. \n\n"}

Aims: We determine if non-ideal MHD, including\nthe effects of ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation determined from a\ndetailed chemical network model, allows for disk formation at the earliest\nstages of star formation (SF). Methods: We employ the axisymmetric thin-disk\napproximation in order to resolve a dynamic range of 9 orders of magnitude in\nlength and 16 in density, while also calculating partial ionization using up to\n19 species in a detailed chemical equilibrium model. MB is applied using a\nsteady-state approximation, and a barotropic relation is used to capture the\nthermal evolution. Results: We resolve the formation of the first and second\ncores, with expansion waves at the periphery of each, a magnetic diffusion\nshock, and prestellar infall profiles at larger radii. Power-law profiles in\neach region can be understood analytically. After the formation of the second\ncore, centrifugal support rises rapidly and a low-mass disk of radius ~10 R_Sun\nis formed, when the second core has mass ~0.001 M_Sun. The mass-to-flux ratio\nis ~10,000 times the critical value in the central region. Conclusions: A small\ncentrifugal disk can form in the earliest stage of SF, due to a shut-off of MB\ncaused by magnetic field dissipation in the first core region.

II.\n  Episodic formation of broad line regions Abstract: (abridged) We study the consequence of star formation (SF) in an self-gravity\ndominated accretion disk in quasars. The warm skins of the SF disk are governed\nby the radiation from the inner part of the accretion disk to form Compton\natmosphere (CAS). The CAS are undergoing four phases to form broad line\nregions. Phase I is the duration of pure accumulation supplied by the SF disk.\nDuring phase II clouds begin to form due to line cooling and sink to the SF\ndisk. Phase III is a period of preventing clouds from sinking to the SF disk\nthrough dynamic interaction between clouds and the CAS. Finally, phase IV is an\ninevitable collapse of the entire CAS through line cooling. This CAS evolution\ndrives the episodic appearance of BLRs. Geometry and dynamics of BLRs can be\nself-consistently derived from the thermal instability of the CAS during phases\nII and III by linear analysis. The metallicity gradient of SF disk gives rise\nto different properties of clouds from outer to inner part of BLRs. We find\nthat clouds have column density N_H < 10^22cm^{-2} in the metal-rich regions\nwhereas they have N_H > 10^22 cm^{-2} in the metal-poor regions. The metal-rich\nclouds compose the high ionization line (HIL) regions whereas the metal-poor\nclouds are in low ionization line (LIL) regions. Metal-rich clouds in HIL\nregions will be blown away by radiation pressure, forming the observed\noutflows.

Dark matter occupies a three-dimensional\n'sheet' of free- fall observers, non-intersecting in six-dimensional\nvelocity-position phase space. At early times, the sheet was flat like an\norigami sheet, i.e. velocities were essentially zero, but as time passes, the\nsheet folds up to form cosmic structure. The present paper further illustrates\nthis analogy, and clarifies a Lagrangian definition of caustics and streams:\ncaustics are two-dimensional surfaces in this initial sheet along which it\nfolds, tessellating Lagrangian space into a set of three-dimensional regions,\ni.e. streams. The main scientific result of the paper is that streams may be\ncolored by only two colors, with no two neighbouring streams (i.e. streams on\neither side of a caustic surface) colored the same. The two colors correspond\nto positive and negative parities of local Lagrangian volumes.

One\ndifficulty, however, is that with the short exposure time ($\\simeq$15 seconds)\nproposed, the spatial variation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) shapes may\nbe dominated by the atmosphere, in addition to optics errors. While optics\nerrors mainly cause the PSF to vary on angular scales similar or larger than a\nsingle CCD sensor, the atmosphere generates stochastic structures on a wide\nrange of angular scales. It thus becomes a challenge to infer the multi-scale,\ncomplex atmospheric PSF patterns by interpolating the sparsely sampled stars in\nthe field. In this paper we present a new method, PSFent, for interpolating the\nPSF shape parameters, based on reconstructing underlying shape parameter maps\nwith a multi-scale maximum entropy algorithm. We demonstrate, using images from\nthe LSST Photon Simulator, the performance of our approach relative to a\n5th-order polynomial fit (representing the current standard) and a simple\nboxcar smoothing technique.

Mass-dependent evolutionary rates arise when the mean volume\ndensity of cluster-forming regions is mass-dependent. In that case, even if the\ninitial conditions are such that the cluster mass function at the end of\nviolent relaxation has the same shape as the embedded-cluster mass function\n(i.e. infant weight-loss is mass-independent), the shape of the cluster mass\nfunction does change transiently {\\it during} violent relaxation. In contrast,\nfor cluster-forming regions of constant mean volume density, the cluster mass\nfunction shape is preserved all through violent relaxation since all clusters\nthen evolve at the same mass-independent rate.\n  On the scale of individual clusters, we model the evolution of the ratio\nbetween the dynamical mass and luminous mass of a cluster after gas expulsion.\nSpecifically, we map the radial dependence of the time-scale for a star cluster\nto return to equilibrium.

The W1 band\nprobes massive early-type galaxies out to z\\gtrsim1. This is more distant than\nSDSS identified early-type galaxies, consistent with the fact that 28% of\n3.4micron sources have faint or no r-band counterparts (r>22.2).

This\nmodel postulates a starburst following each major merger, lasting for a time\nt_SF and converting at most f_star of galactic gas into stars. We include a\nsimple physical prescription for supernovae feedback that suppresses star\nformation in low mass galaxies. Constraining t_SF and f_star to describe the\nobserved star formation rate density at high redshifts, we find that individual\nstarbursts were terminated after a time t_SF~10^7 years. This is comparable to\nthe main-sequence lifetimes of supernova progenitors, indicating that high\nredshift starbursts are quenched once supernovae feedback had time to develop.\nHigh redshift galaxies convert ~10% of their mass into stars for galaxies with\nstar formation rates above ~1 solar mass per year, but a smaller fraction for\nlower luminosity galaxies. Our best fit model successfully predicts the\nobserved relation between star formation rate and stellar mass at z>~4, while\nour deduced relation between stellar mass and halo mass is also consistent with\ndata on the dwarf satellites of the Milky Way.

We observe a spectroscopic binary fraction of 0.35\\pm0.03, which\ncorresponds to the fraction of objects displaying statistically significant\nradial velocity variations with an amplitude of at least 20km/s.

In presence of a magnetic\nfield in the corona, the electron distribution can appear thermal, even when\nacceleration mechanisms would produce non thermal distributions. This is due to\nfast and efficient thermalization through synchrotron self-absorption. We have\nanalyzed data from 6 years of observations of Cygnus X-1 with the INTEGRAL\nobservatory and produced 12 high-quality, stacked broad-band hard X-ray spectra\nrepresentative of the whole range of spectral shapes observed. We then fit\nthese spectra with hybrid thermal/non-thermal Comptonization models and study\nthe evolution of the physical parameters of the accretion flow across the\nspectral transition. In particular, we use the BELM model to constrain the\nmagnetic field in the corona through its effects on the coronal emission.\nIndeed, the hot electrons of the X-ray corona produce soft (optical-UV)\nsynchrotron radiation which is then Comptonized and may affect the temperature\nof the electrons through Compton cooling. We find that in the SS, the emission\nis dominated by Comptonization of the disc photons and the magnetic field is at\nmost of the order of 1E+06 G. In the hard states, the data are consistent with\na pure synchrotron self-Compton model. If the non-thermal excess observed above\na few hundred keV in the HS is produced in the same region as the bulk of the\nthermal Comptonization, we obtain an upper limit on the coronal magnetic field\nof about 1E+05 G. If, on the other hand, the non-thermal excess is produced in\na different location, the constraints on the magnetic field in the HS are\nsomewhat relaxed and the upper limit rises to 1E+07 G.

Contrary to Newtonian gravity, we find the\nfifth force is repulsive in voids. The strength of the fifth force depends on\nthe density inside and outside the void region as well as its radius. It can be\nmany times larger than the Newtonian force and their ratio is in principle\nunbound. This is very different from the case in halos, where the fifth force\nis no more than 1/3 of gravity. The evolution of voids is governed by the\nNewtonian gravity, the effective dark energy force and the fifth force. While\nthe first two forces are common in both LCDM and chameleon universes, the fifth\nforce is unique to the latter. Driven by the outward-pointing fifth force,\nindividual voids in chameleon models expand faster and grow larger than in a\nLCDM universe. The expansion velocity of the void shell can be 20% to 30%\nlarger for voids of a few Mpc/h in radius, while their sizes can be larger by\n~10%. These differences are smaller for larger voids of the same density. We\ncompare void statistics using excursion set theory; for voids of the same size,\ntheir number density is larger in chameleon models. The fractional difference\nincreases with void size. The chance of having voids of radius ~25 Mpc/h can be\n2.5 times larger. This difference is about 10 times larger than that in the\nhalo mass function. We find strong environmental dependence of void properties\nin chameleon models. The differences in size and expansion velocity with GR are\nboth larger for small voids in high density regions. In general, the difference\nbetween chameleon models and LCDM in void properties (size, expansion velocity\nand distribution function) are larger than the corresponding quantities for\nhalos. This suggests that voids might be better candidates than halos for\ntesting gravity. \n\n"}

This material is systematically outflowing and shows a large range in\nparameters. However, its actual nature and dynamics are still not clear. In\norder to gain insights into these important issues we performed a literature\nsearch for papers reporting the parameters of the soft X-ray warm absorbers\n(WAs) in 35 type 1 Seyferts and compared their properties to those of the\nultra-fast outflows (UFOs) detected in the same sample. The fraction of sources\nwith WAs is >60%, consistent with previous studies. The fraction of sources\nwith UFOs is >34%, >67% of which also show WAs. The large dynamic range\nobtained when considering all the absorbers together allows us, for the first\ntime, to investigate general relations among them.

The absorbers continuously populate the\nwhole parameter space, with the WAs and the UFOs lying always at the two ends\nof the distribution.

If the CRs are effectively\naccelerated at the formation of clusters, the kinetic energy of infalling gas\nis consumed by the acceleration and the gas entropy should decrease.

It is argued that the recently\nobserved broadening of the radio spectra and/or light curves in some of the\ntype Ib/c supernovae is a direct indication of inhomogeneities.

Our working model is that: only one of\nthe two BHs in the binary is active, and dynamically dominates its own broad\nline region (BLR); the inactive companion BH is orbiting at a distance of a few\nR_BLR, where R_BLR~0.01-0.1 pc is the BLR size. We search for the expected\nline-of-sight acceleration of the broad line velocity from binary orbital\nmotion by cross-correlating SDSS spectra from two epochs separated by up to\nseveral years in the quasar restframe. Out of ~700 pairs of spectra for which\nwe have good measurements of the velocity shift between two epochs (1-sigma\nerror~40 km/s), we detect 28 systems with significant velocity shifts in broad\nHbeta, among which seven are the best candidates for the hypothesized binaries.\nWe use the distribution of the observed accelerations (mostly non-detections)\nto place constraints on the abundance of such binary systems among the general\nquasar population. Excess variance in the velocity shift is inferred for\nobservations separated by longer than 0.4 yr (quasar restframe).

We solve the radiative transfer of photons in both these\nfrequency ranges and incorporate the results in a perturbed three-level atom\nmodel. We conclude that the instability persists at intermediate scales. We use\nthe results to estimate a distribution of growth rates in $10^{7}$ random\nrealizations of large-scale relative velocities. Our results indicate that\nthere is no appreciable growth; out of these $10^7$ realizations, the maximum\ngrowth factor we find is less than $\\approx 1.2$ at wavenumbers of $k \\approx\n10^{3} \\ {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. The instability's low growth factors are due to the\nrelatively short duration of the recombination epoch during which the electrons\nand photons are coupled. \n\n"}

The rate at\nwhich MRI-driven turbulence transports angular momentum is related to both the\nstrength of the amplitudes of the fluctuations on various scales and the degree\nof anisotropy of the underlying turbulence. This has motivated several studies\nof the distribution of turbulent power in spectral space. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the anisotropic nature of MRI-driven turbulence using a\npseudo-spectral code and introduce novel ways to robustly characterize the\nunderlying turbulence. We show that the general flow properties vary in a\nquasi-periodic way on timescales comparable to 10 inverse angular frequencies\nmotivating the temporal analysis of its anisotropy. We introduce a 3D tensor\ninvariant analysis to quantify and classify the evolution of the anisotropic\nturbulent flow. This analysis shows a continuous high level of anisotropy, with\nbrief sporadic transitions towards two- and three-component isotropic turbulent\nflow. This temporal-dependent anisotropy renders standard shell-average,\nespecially when used simultaneously with long temporal averages, inadequate for\ncharacterizing MRI-driven turbulence. We propose an alternative way to extract\nspectral information from the turbulent magnetized flow, whose anisotropic\ncharacter depends strongly on time. This consists of stacking 1D Fourier\nspectra along three orthogonal directions that exhibit maximum anisotropy in\nFourier space. The resulting averaged spectra show that the power along each of\nthe three independent directions differs by several orders of magnitude over\nmost scales, except the largest ones.

It is a non-renormalizable operator and is\nstrongly coupled at high energy scales. Perturbative analysis does not have a\npredictive power any longer there. In general, when the Lagrangian is expanded\naround the vacuum, the strong coupling scale is identified as the mass scale\nthat appears in non-renormalizable operators. In inflationary models, however,\nthe identification of the strong coupling scale is subtle, since the structures\nof the kinetic term as well as the interaction itself can be modified by the\nbackground inflationary dynamics. Therefore, the strong coupling scale depends\non the background. In this letter, we evaluate the strong coupling scale of the\nfluctuations around the background in the Higgs G-inflation including the\nNambu-Goldstone modes associated with the symmetry breaking. We find that the\nsystem is sufficiently weakly coupled when the scales which we now observe exit\nthe horizon during inflation and the observational predictions with the\nsemiclassical treatment are valid. However, we also find that the inflaton\nfield value at which the strong coupling scale and the Hubble scale meet is\nless than the Planck scale.

Our simulations are based on the general relativistic hydrodynamics\ncode AGILE combined with the detailed neutrino transport scheme IDSA for\nelectron neutrinos and ALS for the muon and tau neutrinos. To trigger\nexplosions in the otherwise non-exploding simulations, we rely on the\nneutrino-driven mechanism. The PUSH method locally increases the energy\ndeposition in the gain region through energy deposition by the heavy neutrino\nflavors. Our setup allows us to model the explosion for several seconds after\ncore bounce. We explore the progenitor range 18-21M$_{\\odot}$. Our studies\nreveal a distinction between high compactness (HC) and low compactness (LC)\nprogenitor models, where LC models tend to explore earlier, with a lower\nexplosion energy, and with a lower remnant mass. HC models are needed to obtain\nexplosion energies around 1 Bethe, as observed for SN1987A. However, all the\nmodels with sufficiently high explosion energy overproduce $^{56}$Ni.

Clues from the distribution of specific star\n  formation rates in SDSS galaxies Abstract: This work investigates the main mechanism(s) that regulate the specific star\nformation rate (SSFR) in nearby galaxies, cross-correlating two proxies of this\nquantity -- the equivalent width of the \\Ha\\ line and the $(u-r)$ colour --\nwith other physical properties (mass, metallicity, environment, morphology, and\nthe presence of close companions) in a sample of $\\sim82500$ galaxies extracted\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The existence of a relatively tight\n`ageing sequence' in the colour-equivalent width plane favours a scenario where\nthe secular conversion of gas into stars (i.e. `nature') is the main physical\ndriver of the instantaneous SSFR and the gradual transition from a `chemically\nprimitive' (metal-poor and intensely star-forming) state to a `chemically\nevolved' (metal-rich and passively evolving) system. Nevertheless,\nenvironmental factors (i.e. `nurture') are also important. In the field,\ngalaxies may be temporarily affected by discrete `quenching' and `rejuvenation'\nepisodes, but such events show little statistical significance in a\nprobabilistic sense, and we find no evidence that galaxy interactions are, on\naverage, a dominant driver of star formation.

In contrast, star formation is significantly reduced and sometimes\ncompletely quenched on a short time scale in dense environments, where many\nobjects are found on a `quenched sequence' in the colour-equivalent width\nplane. \n\n"}

We present two large-scale AMR MHD simulations of several\nthousand $M_\\odot$ of turbulent, isothermal, self-gravitating gas, one with a\nstrong initial magnetic field (Alfven Mach number $M_{A,0}= 1$) and one with a\nweak initial field ($M_{A,0}=10$). We construct samples of the 100 most massive\nclumps in each simulation and show that they exhibit a power-law relation\nbetween field strength and density in excellent agreement with the observed\none. Our results imply that the average field in molecular clumps in the\ninterstellar medium is $<B_{tot}> \\sim 42 n_{H,4}^{0.65} \\mu$G. Furthermore,\nthe median value of the ratio of the line-of-sight field to density$^{0.65}$ in\nthe simulations is within a factor of about (1.3, 1.7) of the observed value\nfor the strong and weak field cases, respectively. The median value of the\nmass-to-flux ratio, normalized to the critical value, is 70% of the\nline-of-sight value.

This suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving the\nenhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks of\ngalaxies.

After the removal of the inner disc the disc is a non accreting\ntransition disc, an object that is rarely seen in observations.

Depending on the parameters, especially on the X-ray\nluminosity of the star, we find that the fraction of time spent as a\nnon-accretor greatly varies. We build a population synthesis model to compare\nwith observations and find that in general thermal sweeping is not effective\nenough to destroy the outer disc, leaving many transition discs in a relatively\nlong lived phase with a gas free hole, at odds with observations. We discuss\nthe implications for transition disc evolution.

We derive a\nstellar mass of log M_*=11.49+0.10-0.16 and a half-light radius of R_e,maj\n=1.8+-0.4 kpc. Taking advantage of the lensing magnification, we are able to\nspatially resolve a remarkably massive yet compact quiescent galaxy at z>2 in\nground-based near-infrared spectroscopic observations using Magellan/FIRE and\nKeck/MOSFIRE. We find no gradient in the strength of the Balmer absorption\nlines over 0.6 R_e - 1.6 R_e, which are consistent with an age of 760 Myr. Gas\nemission in [NII] broadly traces the spatial distribution of the stars and is\ncoupled with weak Halpha emission (log [NII]/Halpha = 0.6+-0.2), indicating\nthat OB stars are not the primary ionizing source. The velocity dispersion\nwithin the effective radius is sigma_e = 271+-41 km/s. We detect rotation in\nthe stellar absorption lines for the first time beyond z~1. Using a\ntwo-integral Jeans model that accounts for observational effects, we measure a\ndynamical mass of log M_dyn =11.24+-0.14 and V/sigma=0.70+-0.21. This is a high\ndegree of rotation considering the modest observed ellipticity of 0.12+-0.08,\nbut it is consistent with predictions from dissipational merger simulations\nthat produce compact remnants. The mass of RG1M0150 implies that it is likely\nto become a slowly rotating elliptical.

This consistency suggests that massive quiescent galaxies\nare virialized systems where the central dark matter concentration is either a\nconstant or negligible fraction of the stellar mass.

Applying this model to close-in exoplanets,\nwe observe that if the relaxation time is longer than the revolution period,\nthe phase space of the system is characterized by the presence of several\nspin-orbit resonances, even in the circular case. As the system evolves, the\nplanet spin can visit different spin-orbit configurations. The obliquity is\ndecreasing along most of these resonances, but we observe a case where the\nplanet tilt is instead growing. These conclusions derived from the secular\ntorque are successfully tested with numerical integrations of the instantaneous\nequations of motion on HD 80606b. Our formalism is also well adapted to\nclose-in super-Earths in multiplanet systems which are known to have non-zero\nmutual inclinations. \n\n"}

We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient\nneeded for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the\nphysical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression\nof CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,\nwhich leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into\ncontact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally\nstable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present. We find that\nCR streaming heating dominates over the heating due to Coulomb and hadronic\nprocesses. Importantly, in simulations that include CR streaming, CR pressure\nsupport in the central 100 kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate\nobservational constraints. On the contrary, when CR streaming is neglected, CR\nenergy is not spent on the ICM heating and CR pressure builds up to the level\nthat is in disagreement with the data. Overall, our models demonstrate that CR\nheating is a viable channel for the thermalization of AGN energy in clusters,\nand likely also in elliptical galaxies, and that CRs play an important role in\ndetermining AGN intermittency and the dynamical state of cool core atmospheres. \n\n"}

For\nthe RVM, the vacuum energy density $\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ carries a mild dependence\non the cosmic expansion rate, i.e. $\\rho_{\\Lambda}(H)$, which allows to\nameliorate the fit quality to the overall $SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+CMB$ cosmological\nobservations as compared to the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model. By letting the\nRVM to deviate from the vacuum option, the equation of state $w=-1$ continues\nto be favored by the overall fit. Vacuum dynamics also predicts the following:\ni) the CMB range of values for $H_0$ is more favored than the local ones, and\nii) smaller values for $\\sigma_8(0)$. As a result, a better account for the LSS\nstructure formation data is achieved as compared to the $\\Lambda$CDM, which is\nbased on a rigid (i.e. non-dynamical) $\\Lambda$ term. \n\n"}

They are thought to be the seeds from which SMBHs grow, which would\nexplain the existence of quasars with BH masses of up to 10$^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$\nwhen the Universe was only 0.8 Gyr old. The detection and study of IMBHs has\nthus strong implications for understanding how SMBHs form and grow, which is\nultimately linked to galaxy formation and growth, as well as for studies of the\nuniversality of BH accretion or the epoch of reionisation. Proving the\nexistence of seed BHs in the early Universe is not yet feasible with the\ncurrent instrumentation; however, those seeds that did not grow into SMBHs can\nbe found as IMBHs in the nearby Universe.

It is known that this leads to an instability, with exponential\namplification of gauge fields, controlled by the parameter $\\xi=\n\\dot{\\phi}/(2fH)$, which can strongly affect the generation of cosmological\nperturbations and even the background. We show that scattering rates involving\ngauge fields can become larger than the expansion rate $H$, due to the very\nlarge occupation numbers, and create a thermal bath of particles of temperature\n$T$ during inflation. In the thermal regime, energy is transferred to smaller\nscales, radically modifying the predictions of this scenario. We thus argue\nthat previous constraints on $\\xi$ are alleviated. If the gauge fields have\nStandard Model interactions, which naturally provides reheating, they\nthermalize already at $\\xi\\gtrsim2.9$, before perturbativity constraints and\nalso before backreaction takes place.

Redshifted CII emission appears in the submillimeter\nregime, meaning it could potentially be present in the higher frequency\nintensity data from the Planck satellite used to measure the cosmic infrared\nbackground (CIB).

The\nsimulations showed that distortions of line profiles, such as those recently\nobserved in lensed quasars, can indeed be reproduced and attributed to the\ndifferential effect of microlensing on spatially separated regions of the BLR.\nWhile the magnification of the emission line $\\mu^{BLR}$ sets an upper limit on\nthe BLR size and, similarly, the magnification of the continuum $\\mu^{cont}$\nsets an upper limit on the size of the continuum source, the line profile\ndistortions mainly depend on the BLR geometry and kinematics.

Here we introduce\nthe Spectral Approach to TTVs technique that allows expanding the TTVs catalog\ntowards lower TTV amplitude, shorter orbital period, and shallower transit\ndepth. In the Spectral Approach we assume that a sinusoidal TTV exists in the\ndata and then calculate the improvement to $\\chi^2$ this model allows over that\nof linear ephemeris model. This enables detection of TTVs even in cases where\nthe transits are too shallow so individual transits cannot be timed.

For rocky exoplanets with 10-1000x Earth's H2O\nbut without H2, we model the multi-Gyr evolution of ocean temperature and\nchemistry, taking into account C partitioning, high-pressure ice phases, and\natmosphere-lithosphere exchange. Within our model, for Sun-like stars, we find\nthat: (1)~the duration of habitable surface water is strongly affected by ocean\nchemistry; (2)~possible ocean pH spans a wide range; (3)~surprisingly, many\nwaterworlds retain habitable surface water for >1 Gyr, and (contrary to\nprevious claims) this longevity does not necessarily involve geochemical\ncycling. The key to this cycle-independent planetary habitability is that C\nexchange between the convecting mantle and the water ocean is curtailed by\nseafloor pressure on waterworlds, so the planet is stuck with the ocean mass\nand ocean cations that it acquires during the first 1% of its history. In our\nmodel, the sum of positive charges leached from the planetary crust by early\nwater-rock interactions is - coincidentally - often within an order of\nmagnitude of the early-acquired atmosphere+ocean inorganic C inventory\noverlaps. As a result, pCO2 is frequently in the \"sweet spot\" (0.2-20 bar) for\nwhich the range of semimajor axis that permits surface liquid water is about as\nwide as it can be. Because the width of the HZ in semimajor axis defines (for\nSun-like stars) the maximum possible time span of surface habitability, this\neffect allows for Gyr of habitability as the star brightens. We illustrate our\nfindings by using the output of an ensemble of N-body simulations as input to\nour waterworld evolution code. Thus (for the first time in an end-to-end\ncalculation) we show that chance variation of initial conditions, with no need\nfor geochemical cycling, can yield multi-Gyr surface habitability on\nwaterworlds. \n\n"}

Such evolution is thought to lead to the inspiral of the binary, the\nejection of the extended envelope and the formation of a remnant short-period\nbinary. However, detailed hydrodynamical models of CEE encounter major\ndifficulties. They show that following the inspiral most of the envelope is not\nejected; though it expands to larger separations, it remains bound to the\nbinary. Here we propose that dust-driven winds can be produced following the\nCEE. These can evaporate the envelope following similar processes operating in\nthe ejection of the envelopes of AGB stars. Pulsations in an AGB-star drives\nthe expansion of its envelope, allowing the material to cool down to low\ntemperatures thus enabling dust condensation. Radiation pressure on the dust\naccelerates it, and through its coupling to the gas it drives winds which\neventually completely erode the envelope. We show that the inspiral phase in\nCE-binaries can effectively replace the role of stellar pulsation and drive the\nCE expansion to scales comparable with those of AGB stars, and give rise to\nefficient mass-loss through dust-driven winds. \n\n"}

Abstract: We report the discovery of an unusual stellar system, SMSS\nJ130522.47-293113.0. The optical spectrum is dominated by a blue continuum\ntogether with emission lines of hydrogen, neutral and ionized helium, and the N\nIII, C III blend at around 4640-4650 Angstrom. The emission line profiles vary\nin strength and position on timescales as short as 1 day, while optical\nphotometry reveals fluctuations of as much as ~0.2 mag in g on timescales as\nshort as 10-15 min. The system is a weak X-ray source (f_{0.3-10} = (1.2 +/-\n0.1) x 10^{-13} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} in the 0.3-10 keV band) but is not detected\nat radio wavelengths (3-sigma upper limit of 50 microJy at 5.5 GHz). The most\nintriguing property of the system, however, is the existence of two \"blobs\", a\nfew arcsec in size, that are symmetrically located 3.8 arcmin (2.2 pc for our\npreferred system distance of ~2 kpc) each side of the central object. The blobs\nare detected in optical and near-IR broadband images but do not show any excess\nemission in Halpha images. We discuss the interpretation of the system,\nsuggesting that the central object is most likely a nova-like CV, and that the\nblobs are relics of a pc-scale accretion-powered collimated outflow. \n\n"}

In this paper, we investigate the\nhypothesis that only certain mass accretion rates result in detectable bandhead\nemission in the near infrared spectra of MYSOs. Using an analytic disc model\ncombined with an LTE model of the CO emission, we find that high accretion\nrates ($\\gtrsim 10^{-4}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}{\\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$) result in large\ndust sublimation radii, a larger contribution to the $K$-band continuum from\nhot dust at the dust sublimation radius, and therefore correspondingly lower CO\nemission with respect to the continuum.

In our simulations, we take into account the\neffects of secular dynamical evolution, stellar evolution, tidal evolution and\nencounters with passing stars. We focus on type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) driven\nby collisions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs). Such collisions can\narise from several channels: (1) collisions due to extremely high\neccentricities induced by secular evolution, (2) collisions following a\ndynamical instability of the system, and (3) collisions driven by semisecular\nevolution. The systems considered here have initially wide inner orbits, with\ninitial semilatus recti larger than 12 AU, implying no interaction if the\norbits were isolated.

The individual errors can have different signs,\nmaking it difficult to anticipate the net effect on inferred occurrence rates.\nHere we use simplified models of signal-to-noise limited transit surveys to try\nand clarify the situation. We derive a formula for the apparent occurrence rate\ndensity measured by an observer who falsely assumes all stars are single. The\nformula depends on the binary fraction; the mass function of the secondary\nstars; and the true occurrence of planets around primaries, secondaries, and\nsingle stars. It also takes into account the Malmquist bias by which binaries\nare over-represented in flux-limited samples.

As the disk accretion rate increases, the disk innermost regions\nwould change from a jet-emitting disk (JED) to a standard accretion disk (SAD).\nWhile JEDs have been proven to successfully reproduce hard states (paper II),\nthe existence of an outer cold SAD introduces an extra non local cooling term.\nWe investigate the thermal structure and associated spectra of such a hybrid\ndisk configuration.

The field makes electrons\ncoherently oscillate and emit the coherent dipole radiations ( FRBs ). The\nradiations stop when thermal fluctuations produced by the oscillation disturb\nthe coherent oscillations. Thus, the duration of the FRBs is determined by the\ntime scale of the thermalization; it is much shorter than $1$ms. Line spectra\nof the dipole radiations are broadened by the thermal effects.

The presence of various center frequencies\n( $1.2$GHz$\\sim $$7$GHz ) in repeating FRB 121102 is attributed to Doppler\nshifts owing to the various relativistic velocities of the accretion disk. On\nthe other hand, non repeating FRBs do not show such variety of the center\nfrequencies. They come from the surfaces of neutron stars.

We\nintroduce a novel tool: the \"mass-luminosity plane\" or \"M-L plane\", as an\nequivalent to the traditional HR diagram, utilising it to reproduce the testbed\nbinary HD166734 with newly calibrated MESA stellar evolution models for single\nstars. We can only reproduce the Galactic binary system with an enhanced amount\nof core overshooting (alpha = 0.5), mass loss, and rotational mixing. We can\nutilise the gradient in the M-L plane to constrain the amount of mass loss to\n0.5 - 1.5 times the standard Vink et al. 2001 prescriptions, and we can exclude\nextreme reduction or multiplication factors. The extent of the vectors in the\nM-L plane leads us to conclude that the amount of core overshooting is larger\nthan is normally adopted in contemporary massive star evolution models.

I show that this characteristic scale can be up to an\norder of magnitude lower than the linear theory Jeans mass, and that even if\none defines the Jeans mass at a higher overdensity, it does not track the\nevolution of this characteristic suppression mass. Instead, the filtering mass,\nwhich corresponds directly to the scale over which baryonic perturbations are\nsmoothed in linear perturbation theory, provides a remarkably good fit to the\ncharacteristic mass scale. Thus, it appears that the effect of reionization on\nstructure formation in both the linear and nonlinear regimes is described by a\nsingle characteristic scale, the filtering scale of baryonic perturbations. In\ncontrast to the Jeans mass, the filtering mass depends on the full thermal\nhistory of the gas instead of the instantaneous value of the sound speed, so it\naccounts for the finite time required for pressure to influence the gas\ndistribution in the expanding universe. In addition to the characteristic\nsuppression mass, I study the full shape of the probability distribution to\nfind an object with a given gas mass among all the objects with the same total\nmass, and I show that the numerical results can be described by a simple\nfitting formula that again depends only on the filtering mass.

Instead, the halo profiles converge at\nscales larger than four times the formal resolution or the radius containing\nmore than 200 particles, whichever is larger. In the simulations presented in\nthis paper, we are able to probe density profile of a relaxed isolated\ngalaxy-size halo at scales r=(0.005-1)r_vir.

N-body simulations with a resolution high enough not to suffer from\novermerging (subhalo disruption due to numerical processes) show a high\nabundance of subhaloes in both galaxies and in galaxy clusters. However,\nobservations seem to show a high subhalo abundance in galaxy clusters only.\nThus, it appears that too many subhaloes survive in simulated galaxy haloes.\nThere are five main causes for this apparent galaxy subhalo problem. The most\nradical one is a change to a cosmology in which structure formation is not\nhierarchical below the galaxy halo mass scale. If this is unacceptable, four\ncauses remain, of which the most important one appears to be that dynamical\nfriction is not properly simulated yet, not even for the highest resolution\nsimulations to date, resulting in an 'undermerging' problem. The other causes\nare (numerical) overmerging, differences in the timing of halo formation and\nmerging in hierarchical structure formation, and significant differences is\nmass-to-light ratios. The net effect of these four causes is that galaxies have\na relatively low abundance of subhaloes, i.e. dwarfs, while at the same time a\nlarge number of field dwarf galaxies can exist which are dark enough to be\nmissed observationally. \n\n"}

First, we show that the dark bursts cannot be explained by a failure to\nimage deeply enough quickly enough: We fit a variety of brightness distribution\nmodels to the optical data, and find that approx. 57(+13,-11)% of all bursts,\nand approx. 82(+22,-17)% of dark bursts, have afterglows that are fainter than\nR = 24 mag 18 hours after the burst.

Abstract: Using a large set of optically detected hotspots in powerful extragalactic\ndouble radio sources, we examine the basic question of whether the detection of\noptical synchrotron radiation requires in-situ acceleration of relativistic\nelectrons within the hotspots/lobes. For this, we take into account the jet's\nbulk relativistic motion, as well as its likely misalignment from the plane of\nthe sky. Together, both these factors can drastically reduce the apparent range\nof the ultra-relativistic electrons ejected from the nucleus in the form of a\njet. The conventionally adopted parameter space for the fundamental variables,\nnamely, the hotspot magnetic field, radio source orientation angle relative to\nthe line-of-sight and the bulk speed of the jet plasma, is considered. We find\nthat the observed optical/near-IR synchrotron emission of the hotspots can be\nexplained even if the radiating relativistic electrons were accelerated\nexclusively within the nuclear region, provided the energy losses incurred by\nthe electrons during their transport down the jet are dominated by inverse\nCompton upscatterings of the cosmic microwave background photons.

The Einstein radius crossing time\nfor this event is approximately one year, which is unusually long. We show that\nthe motion of the Earth induces these multiple peaks in the light curve, since\nthe relative transverse velocity of the lens projected into the observer plane\nis very small (v = 12.5 km/s). This is the lowest velocity so far published and\nwe believe that this is the first multiple-peak parallax event ever observed.\nWe also believe that this event may be exhibiting slight binary-source\nsignatures in addition to these parallax-induced multiple peaks.

Dense\nphotometric coverage of one caustic crossing yields the crossing timescale dt.\nLess frequent coverage of the entire event yields the Einstein timescale t_E\nand the angle phi of source trajectory with respect to the caustic. The\nphotometric light curve solution predicts the motion of the source centroid up\nto an orientation on the sky and overall scale. A few precise astrometric\nmeasurements therefore yield theta_E, the angular Einstein ring radius. Then\nthe angular radius of the source is obtained by theta_*=theta_E(dt/t_E)\nsin(phi).

The average flux was almost the same in both,\nbut during each observation the flux showed significant time variations by a\nfactor of two on timescales of 20-40 ks. Each spectrum could be fit by either\nan absorbed power-law model with a photon index of ~3 or a thin-thermal plasma\nmodel with a temperature of ~2 keV and an extremely low metal abundance (<~0.1\nsolar). The spectrum of the first observation has a weak-line feature at about\n6.8 keV, which might correspond to highly ionized iron Kalpha.

The supersonic motions of galaxies may\npotentially provide an important source of heating for the intracluster gas by\ndriving weak shocks and via dynamical friction, although these heating\nprocesses appear to be inefficient in our simulations.

During the subsequent evolution, the\nsubhaloes experience mass loss due to the combined effect of dynamical\nfriction, tidal stripping, and tidal heating. Rather than integrating these\neffects along individual subhalo orbits, we consider the average mass loss\nrate, where the average is taken over all possible orbital configurations. This\nallows us to write the average mass loss rate as a simple function that depends\nonly on redshift and on the instantaneous mass ratio of subhalo and parent\nhalo. After calibrating the model by matching the subhalo mass function (SHMF)\nof cluster-sized dark matter haloes obtained from numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the predicted mass and redshift dependence of the SHMF.We find\nthat, contrary to previous claims, the subhalo mass function is not universal.\nInstead, both the slope and the normalization depend on the ratio of the parent\nhalo mass, M, and the characteristic non-linear mass M*.

If grain growth during the classical T Tauri phase\nproduces plenty of millimeter sized grains, such grains completely accrete onto\nthe star in 10^7 yr, before photoevaporation begins to drain the inner gas disk\nand the star evolves to the weak line T Tauri phase. In the weak line phase,\nonly dust-poor gas disks remain at large radii (> 10 AU), without strong signs\nof gas accretion nor of millimeter thermal emission from the dust. For Herbig\nAeBe stars, the strong photoevaporation clears the inner disks in 10^6 yr,\nbefore the dust grains in the outer disk migrate to the inner region. In this\ncase, the grains left behind in the outer gas disk accumulate at the disk inner\nedge (at 10-100 AU from the star).

Galactic Black Hole (GBH) power density spectra\n(PDS) are generally complex, and dependent on spectral state. In the low/hard\nstate the high-frequency rollover in the PDS moves in a way which is not simply\nrelated to luminosity. Hence this feature can only be used as an approximate\nindicator rather than as an accurate tracer of black hole mass in AGN. The\nX-ray spectrum in the high/soft state is dominated by the disc in GBH, which is\nrather stable. We show that the PDS of the Comptonized tail in GBH can be much\nmore variable, and that it is this which should be compared to AGN due to their\nmuch lower disc temperature. This bandpass effect removes a problem in\ninterpreting the (often highly variable) Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies\nas the counterparts of the high mass accretion rate GBH. Additionally, we\nspeculate that some NLS1 (e.g. Akn 564) are counterparts of the very high\nstate. The Comptonized tail in this state is also highly variable, but with PDS\nwhich can be roughly described as band-limited noise. This shape is similar to\nthat seen in the low/hard state, so merely seeing such band-limited noise in\nthe power spectrum of an AGN does not necessarily imply low luminosity. We also\nstress that Cyg X-1, often used for comparison with AGN, is not a typical black\nhole system due to its persistent nature. In particular, the shape of its power\nspectrum in the high/soft state is markedly different from that of other\n(transient) GBH systems in this state. The fact that the NLS1s NGC 4051 and\nMCG-6-30-15 do appear to show a power spectrum similar to that of the high/soft\nstate of Cyg X-1 may lend observational support to theoretical speculation that\nthe Hydrogen ionization disc instability does not operate in AGN. \n\n"}

These stellar\nstructures extend out to several hundred kpc away from a galaxy, and consist of\nstars shed by merging subunits during the many accretion events that\ncharacterize the hierarchical assembly of galaxies. Such origin suggests that\nouter luminous halos are ubiquitous and that they should appear as an excess of\nlight over extrapolations of the galaxy's inner profile beyond its traditional\nluminous radius. The mass profile of the accreted stellar component is well\napproximated by a model where the logarithmic slope steepens monotonically with\nradius; from -3 at the luminous edge of the galaxy to -4 or steeper near the\nvirial radius of the system. Such spatial distribution is consistent with that\nof Galactic and M31 globular clusters, suggesting that many of the globulars\nwere brought in by accretion events, in a manner akin to the classic\nSearle-Zinn scenario.

Then we calculated the hardness ratio ($hr_{T}$) over the\nassigned T90 for the long bursts and over their own T90 for the shout bursts,\nand studied the relation between the hardness ratio and the corresponding T90\nfor these two samples. We also calculated the hardness ratio ($hr_{t}$) over\nthe randomly selected 64 ms time intervals within the T90, and investigated the\nrelation between this hardness ratio and the selected 64 ms time interval. In\naddition, the $hr_{t}$ within and beyond the first 2 seconds for all the long\nbursts (sample 3; N=1541) were also investigated. We found that the KS\nprobabilities of the distributions of the $hr_{T}$ (7.15337E-15) and $hr_{t}$\n(9.54833E-10) for samples 1 and 2 are very small, and the average value of\n$hr_{T}$ and $hr_{t}$ of short bursts are obviously larger than that of the\nlong bursts. The correlations between log$hr_{T}$ and logT90, and between\nlog$hr_{t}$ and log t, for samples 1 and 2 are different. These show that short\nand long bursts in the first 2 seconds have different characters and they\nprobably originate from different progenitors. For sample 3, for the two time\nintervals, the KS probability is 5.35828E-5, which suggests that the hardness\nratios in different time intervals for long bursts are also different. \n\n"}

Such a star\ncluster would sink toward the center of the galaxy, and at the same time stars\nare stripped out of the cluster by the tidal field of the parent galaxy. We\ninvestigated the orbital evolution of the IMBH, after its parent cluster is\ncompletely disrupted by the tidal field of the parent galaxy, by means of\nlarge-scale N-body simulations. We constructed a model of the central region of\nour galaxy, with an SMBH (supermassive black hole) and Bahcall-Wolf stellar\ncusp, and placed an IMBH in a circular orbit of radius 0.086pc. The IMBH sinks\ntoward the SMBH through dynamical friction, but dynamical friction becomes\nineffective when the IMBH reached the radius inside which the initial stellar\nmass is comparable to the IMBH mass.

Abstract: CONTEXT.The mass assembly is believed to be the dominant process of early\ngalaxy formation. This mechanism of galaxy building can proceed either by\nrepeated major mergers with other systems, or by means of accretion of matter\nfrom the surrounding regions. AIMS.In this paper we compare the properties of\nlocal disk galaxies that appear isolated, i.e. not tidally affected by other\ngalaxies during the last few Gyr within the volume given by cz<= 5000 km/s,\nwith those galaxies at z values from 0.25 to 5.\n  METHODS.Effective radii for 203 isolated galaxies and 1645 galaxies from the\nRC3 have been collected and the two samples have been analyzed statistically. A\nsimilar comparison has been made with half light radii studied at high z from\nthe literature.\n  RESULTS.We found that isolated galaxies are in general smaller than other\npresent epoch galaxies from the RC3. We notice the lack of systems larger than\n7 kpc among them. Their size distribution appears to be similar to that of\ngalaxies at 1.4 <= z <= 2. The models of the merging history also indicate that\nthe isolated galaxies did stop their merging process at about that redshift,\nevolving passively since then.

It is shown that, in addition to the well-known relation between\nthe mass and concentration of the dark matter halo, the effective polytropic\nindex of the gas also varies systematically with cluster mass, and therefore\nneither the dark matter nor the gas profiles are exactly self-similar.

The radio emission occurs on three different spatial scales, from ~7.5\nkpc bubbles to ~1.5 kpc bubbles lying nearly orthogonal to them and a ~1 kpc\nradio jet lying orthogonal to the kpc-scale bubble. To explain the complex\nmorphology, we first consider a scenario in which the radio structures are the\nresult of superwinds ejected by a nuclear starburst. However, recent Spitzer\nobservations of Mrk 6 provide an upper limit to the star formation rate (SFR)\nof ~5.5 M_sun/yr, an estimate much lower than the SFR of ~33 M_sun/yr derived\nassuming that the bubbles are a result of starburst winds energized by\nsupernovae explosions. Thus, a starburst alone cannot meet the energy\nrequirements for the creation of the bubbles in Mrk 6.

They rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominant\nSF episode of galaxies, after which SF gradually declines on Gyr timescales to\nz=0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy's M_*. With decreasing mass, this onset of\nmajor SF shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies (staged\ngalaxy formation). This process may be an important component of the\n``downsizing'' phenomenon. We find that the predominantly gradual decline of\nSFR (Noeske et al. 2007, this volume) can be reproduced by exponential SF\nhistories (tau models), if less massive galaxies have systematically longer\ne-folding times tau, and a later onset of SF (z_f).

The degree of color\nevolution is similar for clusters at similar redshift, and does not depend\nstrongly on the optical richness or X-ray luminosity of the cluster, suggesting\nthat the history of early-type galaxies is relatively insensitive to\nenvironment. The slope of the color-magnitude relationship shows no significant\nchange out to z=0.9, providing evidence that it arises from a correlation\nbetween galaxy mass and metallicity, not age. Finally, the intrinsic scatter in\nthe optical-IR colors is small and nearly constant with redshift, indicating\nthat the majority of giant, early-type galaxies in clusters share a common star\nformation history, with little perturbation due to uncorrelated episodes of\nlater star formation. Taken together, our results are consistent with models in\nwhich most early-type galaxies in rich clusters are old, formed the majority of\ntheir stars at high redshift in a well-synchronized fashion, and evolved\nquiescently thereafter. \n\n"}

Although the ZA\ncorrectly reproduces the linear growing modes of density and velocity\nperturbations, non-linear growth is inaccurately represented because of the ZA\nfailure to conserve momentum. This implies that it takes time for the actual\ndynamics to establish the correct statistical properties of density and\nvelocity fields. We extend perturbation theory (PT) to include transients as\nnon-linear excitations of decaying modes caused by the IC. We focus on\nhigher-order statistics of the density contrast and velocity divergence,\ncharacterized by the S_p and T_p parameters. We find that the time-scale of\ntransients is determined, at a given order p, by the spectral index n. The\nskewness factor S_3 (T_3) attains 10% accuracy only after a=6 (a=15) for n=0,\nwhereas higher (lower) n demands more (less) expansion away from the IC. These\nrequirements become much more stringent as p increases. An Omega=0.3 model\nrequires a factor of two larger expansion than an Omega=1 model to reduce\ntransients by the same amount. The predicted transients in S_p are in good\nagreement with numerical simulations. More accurate IC can be achieved by using\n2nd order Lagrangian PT (2LPT), which reproduces growing modes up to 2nd order\nand thus eliminates transients in the skewness.

The blast\nwave generated by a GRB explosion would be washed out by interstellar\nturbulence only after tens of millions of years when it finally slows down to a\nvelocity of 10 km/s. This rather long lifetime implies that there could be up\nto several tens of active GRB remnants in each galaxy at any given time.

As the D4-brane slides along the two 5-branes towards\nthe 6-brane it begins to oscillate near the minimum of the potential. The\ninflaton field couples to the massless Standard Model fields through Yukawa\ncouplings. In the brane picture these couplings are introduced by having\nanother D6'-brane intersect the D4-brane such that the 4-6' strings, whose\nlowest lying modes are the Standard Model matter, couple to the scalar mode of\nthe 4-4 strings, the inflaton. The inflaton can decay into scalar and spinor\nparticles on the 4-6' strings, reheating the universe. Observational data is\nused to place constraints on the parameters of the model. \n\n"}

Chaotic quantization thus allows to predict fundamental constants of\nnature from first principles.

{"id": "hep-th/0403020", "contents": "Title: Beyond Inflation: A Cyclic Universe Scenario Abstract: Inflation has been the leading early universe scenario for two decades, and\nhas become an accepted element of the successful `cosmic concordance' model.\nHowever, there are many puzzling features of the resulting theory. It requires\nboth high energy and low energy inflation, with energy densities differing by a\nhundred orders of magnitude. The questions of why the universe started out\nundergoing high energy inflation, and why it will end up in low energy\ninflation, are unanswered. Rather than resort to anthropic arguments, we have\ndeveloped an alternative cosmology, the Cyclic universe, in which the universe\nexists in a very long-lived attractor state determined by the laws of physics.\nThe model shares inflation's phenomenological successes without requiring an\nepoch of high energy inflation. Instead, the universe is made homogeneous and\nflat, and scale-invariant adiabatic perturbations are generated during an epoch\nof low energy acceleration like that seen today, but preceding the last big\nbang. Unlike inflation, the model requires low energy acceleration in order for\na periodic attractor state to exist. The key challenge facing the scenario is\nthat of passing through the cosmic singularity at t=0. Substantial progress has\nbeen made at the level of linearised gravity, which is reviewed here. The\nchallenge of extending this to nonlinear gravity and string theory remains. \n\n"}

The most remarkable\nfeature of the Gauss-Bonnet gravity is that at high energy it radically\ntransforms radial dependence from inverse to proportionality as singularity is\napproached and thereby making it weak. Similar change over also occurs in\napproach to singularity in loop quantum gravity. It is analogous to Planck's\nlaw of radiation where similar change occurs for high and low energy behavior.\nThis is how it seems to anticipate in qualitative terms and in the right sense\nthe quantum gravity effect in 5 dimensions where it is physically non-trivial.\nThe really interesting question is, could this desirable feature be brought\ndown to the $4-$dimensional spacetime by dilatonic coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet\nterm or otherwise? \n\n"}
