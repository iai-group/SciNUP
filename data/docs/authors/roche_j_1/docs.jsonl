Given any\nfinite-range interaction potentials, one can thus predict the effective\nthree-body force from a numerical solution of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation.

These sources properly account for the dimuons produced in\nproton-nucleus collisions. In this paper, we show that dimuons are also\nproduced in excess in 158 A GeV In-In collisions. We furthermore observe, by\ntagging the dimuon vertices, that this excess is not due to enhanced D meson\nproduction, but made of prompt muon pairs, as expected from a source of thermal\ndimuons specific to high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. The yield of this\nexcess increases significantly from peripheral to central collisions, both with\nrespect to the Drell-Yan yield and to the number of nucleons participating in\nthe collisions. Furthermore, the transverse mass distributions of the excess\ndimuons are well described by an exponential function, with inverse slope\nvalues around 190 MeV.

The Yukawa couplings of the triplet fermion and the\nleft-handed neutrinos with the doublet Higgs field produce the Dirac mass\nterms. Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light\nneutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We point out that it is also possible\nto have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate\nthe seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is\nconstrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa\ncouplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet. We also\nfind that unlike the usual Type III seesaw model where at least two copies of\nleptonic triplets are needed, with both doublet and quadruplet Higgs\nrepresentations, just one leptonic triplet is possible to have a\nphenomenologically acceptable model because light neutrino masses can receive\nsizable contributions at both tree and one loop levels.

The\nform factors are all approximated by a simple dipole function, normalized to\nthe charge or magnetic moment of the nucleon. The differences between the\nproton and neutron form factors and the deviation of GEn from zero are\nsensitive to the difference between up- and down-quark contributions to the\nform factors.\n  Methods: We combine recent measurements of the neutron form factors with\nupdated extractions of the proton form factors, accounting for two-photon\nexchange corrections and including an estimate of the uncertainties for all of\nthe form factors to obtain a complete set of measurements up to Q^2\napproximately 4 (GeV/c)^2. We use this to extract the up- and down-quark\ncontributions which we compare to recent fits and calculations.\n  Results: We find a large differences between the up- and down-quark\ncontributions to G_E and G_M, implying significant flavor dependence in the\ncharge and magnetization distributions. The rapid falloff of the ratio GEp/GMp\ndoes not appear in the individual quark form factors, but arises from a\ncancellation between the up- and down-quark contributions. We see indications\nthat the down-quark contributions to the Dirac and Pauli form factors deviate\nfrom the suggested 1/Q^4 scaling behavior suggested by a previous analysis.\nFinally, while recent models provide a generally good qualitative description\nof the data, the down-quark contribution to G_E/G_M and F_2/F_1 are not\nreproduced by any of the models. Finally, we note that while the inclusion of\nrecent $\\gmn$ data from CLAS modifies the high-$Q^2$ slightly, the tension\nbetween these data and previous measurements at lower $Q^2$ has a more\nsignificant impact, suggesting the need for additional data in this region. \n\n"}

Neutrons generated at\nthese events can react with $^7$Be nuclei and reduce $^7$Be abundance solving a\nproblem of the primordial $^7$Li abundance. We suggest that thermal neutron\ninjection is a way to derive a model independent conservative limit on the\nrelation between abundances of D and $^7$Li in a hadronic energy injection\nmodel. We emphasize that an uncertainty in cross sections of inelastic $n+p$\nscattering affects the total number of induced neutrons, which determines final\nabundances of D and $^7$Li. In addition, the annihilations of antinucleons with\n$^4$He result in higher D abundance and trigger nonthermal $^6$Li production.\nIt is concluded that a reduction of $^7$Li abundance from a value in the\nstandard big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) model down to an observational two\n$\\sigma$ upper limit is necessarily accompanied by an undesirable increase of D\nabundance up to at least an observational 12 $\\sigma$ upper limit from\nobservations of quasi-stellar object absorption line systems.

We highlight that in the interesting scenario\nwhere this particle has a weak scale mass, this out-of-equilibrium condition\nrequires a proper decay length larger than O(1) mm. Such new fields are within\nreach of the LHC, at which they can be pair produced leaving a distinctive,\ndisplaced-vertex signature. This scenario is realized in the recently proposed\nmechanism of baryogenesis where the baryon asymmetry is produced through the\nfreeze-out and subsequent decay of a meta-stable weakly interacting massive\nparticle (\"WIMP baryogenesis\"). In analogy to missing energy searches for WIMP\ndark matter, the LHC is an excellent probe of these new long-lived particles\nresponsible for baryogenesis via the low-background displaced vertex channel.\nIn our paper, we estimate the limits on simplified models inspired by WIMP\nbaryogenesis from two of the most sensitive collider searches by CMS and ATLAS\nwith 8 TeV LHC data.

Due to their heavy mass, charm quarks are expected to\nthermalize much more slowly than light flavor quarks. The charm quark flow is a\nunique tool to study the extent of thermalization of the bulk medium dominated\nby light quarks and gluons. At high $p_T$, D meson azimuthal anisotropy is\nsensitive to the path length dependence of charm quark energy loss in the\nmedium, which offers new insights into heavy quark energy loss mechanisms -\ngluon radiation vs. collisional processes.

QCD is characterised by two emergent\nphenomena: confinement & dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB). They are\nexpressed with great force in the character of the pion. In turn, pion\nproperties suggest that confinement & DCSB are closely connected. As both a\nNambu-Goldstone boson and a quark-antiquark bound-state, the pion is unique in\nNature. Developing an understanding of its properties is thus critical to\nrevealing basic features of the Standard Model. We describe experimental\nprogress in this direction, made using electromagnetic probes, highlighting\nboth improvements in the precision of charged-pion form factor data, achieved\nin the past decade, and new results on the neutral-pion transition form factor.\nBoth challenge existing notions of pion structure. We also provide a\ntheoretical context for these empirical advances, first explaining how DCSB\nworks to guarantee that the pion is unnaturally light; but also, nevertheless,\nensures the pion is key to revealing the mechanisms that generate nearly all\nthe mass of hadrons. Our discussion unifies the charged-pion elastic and\nneutral-pion transition form factors, and the pion's twist-2 parton\ndistribution amplitude. It also indicates how studies of the charged-kaon form\nfactor can provide significant contributions. Importantly, recent predictions\nfor the large-$Q^2$ behaviour of the pion form factor can be tested by\nexperiments planned at JLab 12. Those experiments will extend precise\ncharged-pion form factor data to momenta that can potentially serve in\nvalidating factorisation theorems in QCD, exposing the transition between the\nnonperturbative and perturbative domains, and thereby reaching a goal that has\nlong driven hadro-particle physics. \n\n"}

The deuterium data show a smaller\nlongitudinal structure function, and smaller ratio of longitudinal to\ntransverse cross section R, than the proton.

This thesis concentrates on the\nunderstanding of the LMR enhancement regarding its $M_{ee}$, $p_{T}$ and energy\ndependence. It studies dielectron production in Au+Au collisions at beam\nenergies of 19.6, 27, 39, and 62.4 GeV with sufficient statistics. In\nconjunction with the published STAR results at top RHIC energy, this thesis\npresents results on the first comprehensive energy-dependent study of\ndielectron production.\n  The comparison of $M_{ee}$- and $p_{T}$-spectra with cocktail simulations of\nhadronic sources reveals a sizeable and steadily increasing excess yield in the\nLMR at all beam energies. The scenario of broadened in-medium $\\rho$ spectral\nfunctions proves to not only serve well as dominating underlying source but\nalso to be universal in nature since it quantitatively and qualitatively\nexplains the LMR enhancements from SPS to top RHIC energies. It shows that most\nof the enhancement is governed by interactions of the $\\rho$ meson with thermal\nresonance excitations in the late(r)-stage hot and dense hadronic phase. This\nconclusion is supported by the energy-dependent measurement of integrated LMR\nexcess yields and enhancement factors.

While\nTPE is difficult to calculate in a model-independent way, it can be determined\nexperimentally from asymmetries between electron-proton and positron-proton\nscattering.

Merging with\ncosmology and particle physics, astrophysics of CR has become a very dynamic\nfield with a large potential of breakthrough and discoveries in the near\nfuture.

The rate is\ndetermined by Coulomb barrier penetration in dense environments and by the\nastrophysical S-factor at low energies. We evaluate previous studies of the\nCoulomb barrier problem and propose a simple phenomenological formula for the\nreaction rate which covers all cases. The parameters of this formula can be\nvaried, taking into account current theoretical uncertainties in the reaction\nrate. The results are illustrated for the example of the ^{12}C+^{12}C fusion\nreaction. This reaction is very important for the understanding of nuclear\nburning in evolved stars, in exploding white dwarfs producing type Ia\nsupernovae, and in accreting neutron stars. The S-factor at stellar energies\ndepends on a reliable fit and extrapolation of the experimental data. We\ncalculate the energy dependence of the S-factor using a recently developed\nparameter-free model for the nuclear interaction, taking into account the\neffects of the Pauli nonlocality.

Abstract: Direct photon production from a quark gluon plasma (QGP) in thermal\nequilibrium is studied directly in real time. In contrast to the usual S-matrix\ncalculations, the real time approach is valid for a QGP that formed and reached\nLTE a short time after a collision and of finite lifetime ($\\sim 10-20\n\\mathrm{fm}/c$ as expected at RHIC or LHC). We point out that during such\nfinite QGP lifetime the spectrum of emitted photons carries information on the\ninitial state. There is an inherent ambiguity in separating the virtual from\nthe observable photons during the transient evolution of the QGP. We propose a\nreal time formulation to extract the photon yield which includes the initial\nstage of formation of the QGP parametrized by an effective time scale of\nformation $\\Gamma^{-1}$. This formulation coincides with the S-matrix approach\nin the infinite lifetime limit. It allows to separate the virtual cloud as well\nas the observable photons emitted during the pre- equilibrium stage from the\nyield during the QGP lifetime. We find that the lowest order contribution\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_{em})$ which does \\emph{not} contribute to the S-matrix\napproach, is of the same order of or larger than the S-matrix contribution\nduring the lifetime of the QGP for a typical formation time $\\sim 1\n\\mathrm{fm}/c$.

Abstract: Precision tests of the standard model are essential for constraining models\nof new physics. Neutrino-electron elastic scattering offers a clean probe into\nmany electroweak effects that are complimentary to the more canonical\nmeasurements done at collider facilities. Such reactions are rare, even as\ncompared with the already tiny cross-sections for neutrino-nucleon scattering,\nand competitive precision measurements have historically been challenging to\nobtain. Due to new existing and proposed high-flux neutrino sources, this is\nabout to change. We present a topical survey of precision measurements that can\nbe done with neutrino-electron scattering in light of these new developments.\nSpecifically, we consider four distinct neutrino sources: nuclear reactors,\nneutrino factories, beta-beams, and conventional beams. For each source we\nestimate the expected future precision of several representative observables,\nincluding the weak mixing angle, neutrino magnetic moments, and potential\nleptonic Z' couplings.

The Skyrme model is supposed to encode the large $N_c$ behavior\nof baryons, and can be formulated for both of these large $N_c$ limits. There\nis an apparent paradox associated with the large $N_c$ behavior of strange\nquark matrix elements in the Skyrme model. The model only distinguishes between\nthe two large $N_c$ limits via the $N_c$ scaling of the couplings and the\nWitten-Wess-Zumino term, so that a vanishing leading order strange matrix\nelement in the TLNC limit implies that it also vanishes at leading order in the\nOLNC limit, contrary to the expectations based on the\nsuppression/non-suppression of quark loops.

Abstract: Several experiments have extracted proton electromagnetic form factors from\nelastic cross section measurements using the Rosenbluth technique. Global\nanalyses of these measurements indicate approximate scaling of the electric and\nmagnetic form factors (mu_p*G_E/G_M = 1), in contrast to recent polarization\ntransfer measurements from Jefferson Lab. We present here a global reanalysis\nof the cross section data aimed at understanding the disagreement between the\nRosenbluth extraction and the polarization transfer data. We find that the\nindividual cross section measurements are self-consistent, and that the new\nglobal analysis yields results that are still inconsistent with polarization\nmeasurements. This discrepancy indicates a fundamental problem in one of the\ntwo techniques, or a significant error in polarization transfer or cross\nsection measurements. An error in the polarization data would imply a large\nerror in the extracted electric form factor, while an error in the cross\nsections implies an uncertainty in the extracted form factors, even if the form\nfactor ratiois measured exactly. \n\n"}

Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory governing the strong interaction\nof particles. It describes the interactions that bind quarks and gluons into\nprotons and neutrons, and binds these into nuclei. We believe QCD to be as\nfundamental and complete as QED, the theory of electromagnetic interactions,\nwhose predictions have been tested to more than ten decimal places. If it were\npossible to make calculations in QCD the same way we can in QED, we would have\nremoved one of the biggest obstacles in the way of understanding matter in the\nuniverse. Unfortunately, the properties of QCD make such calculations\nimpossible at present. Historically, there have been two approaches to this\nproblem. First, we work to improve our ability to solve QCD, with the most\nvisible effort being the field of Lattice QCD. Second, we make models of QCD\nthat attempt to incorporate what we believe to be the most important\nsymmetries, dynamics, or degrees of freedom, and then test these models against\nexperimental measurements sensitive to these assumptions. Even the earliest\nquark models of hadrons structure and the simplest bag models have had great\nsuccess, far beyond any reasonable expectation, indicating that these models\nhave isolated some of the key features of QCD.

Special emphasis is put on its relation to the\nfluctuation of the chiral order parameter $<\\bar{q}q>$. In the vacuum, the\n$\\sigma$-meson is an elusive resonance corresponding to a pole deep in the\nsecond Riemann sheet of the $\\pi$-$\\pi$ scattering matrix in the $I$=$J$=0\nchannel. This is because the the amplitude fluctuation of $<\\bar{q}q>$\n(corresponding to {\\rm ur}-$\\sigma$) and the phase fluctuation of $<\\bar{q}q>$\n(2 pion states) mix strongly in the vacuum. As the temperature and/or density\nof the system increase, however, there arises a softening of this complex pole\ndue to the partial restoration of chiral symmetry. Such soft modes play a key\nrole to understand the QCD phase structure. We demonstrate that even a slight\nsoftening of the $\\sigma$ mode could induce strong spectral enhancement and\nstrong $\\pi$-$\\pi$ correlation near the 2$m_{\\pi}$ threshold in the $I$=$J$=0\nchannel, which thereby can be a signature of the partial restoration of chiral\nsymmetry. Such spectral enhancement may be seen not only in hot matter created\nby the relativistic heavy ion collisions but also in cold matter (heavy nuclei)\nprobed by photons and hadrons. Relevance of the partial restoration of chiral\nsymmetry in heavy nuclei with the recent data by the CHAOS and CB\ncollaborations as well as with on-going and future experiments are also\ndiscussed. \n\n"}
