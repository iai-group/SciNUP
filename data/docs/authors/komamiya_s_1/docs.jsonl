While the average momentum\napproximation can partly simulate the Fermi motion in the process, the ``frozen\nnucleon'' assumption yields very different results, especially at lower\nenergies. The Coulomb effect induced by the interaction between the positively\ncharged kaon and the hypertriton is found to be negligible. The influence of\nhigher partial waves is also found to be relatively small, in contrast to the\nfinding of the previous work.

These models exhibit peculiar features, such as\nan essential mixing of scalar and tensor kinetic terms, which we have named\nkinetic braiding. This braiding causes the scalar stress tensor to deviate from\nthe perfect-fluid form. Cosmology in these models possesses a rich\nphenomenology, even in the limit where the scalar is an exact Goldstone boson.\nGenerically, there are attractor solutions where the scalar monitors the\nbehaviour of external matter. Because of the kinetic braiding, the position of\nthe attractor depends both on the form of the Lagrangian and on the external\nenergy density. The late-time asymptotic of these cosmologies is a de Sitter\nstate. The scalar can exhibit phantom behaviour and is able to cross the\nphantom divide with neither ghosts nor gradient instabilities. These features\nprovide a new class of models for Dark Energy. As an example, we study in\ndetail a simple one-parameter model.

Because of the\nnonrelativistic dispersion relations, the speed of light is unlimited, and test\nparticles do not follow geodesics. As a result, there are significant\ndifferences in causal structures and black holes between general relativity\n(GR) and the HL theory. In particular, the horizon radii generically depend on\nthe energies of test particles. Applying them to the spherical static vacuum\nsolutions found recently in the nonrelativistic general covariant theory of\ngravity, we find that, for test particles with sufficiently high energy, the\nradius of the horizon can be made as small as desired, although the\nsingularities can be seen in principle only by observers with infinitely high\nenergy. In these studies, we pay particular attention to the global structure\nof the solutions, and find that, because of the\nfoliation-preserving-diffeomorphism symmetry, ${Diff}(M,{\\cal{F}})$, they are\nquite different from the corresponding ones given in GR, even though the\nsolutions are the same. In particular, the ${Diff}(M,{\\cal{F}})$ does not allow\nPenrose diagrams.

However, the former option is very tightly\nconstrained by experiment already, the latter generically leads to problems\nwith locality.

Abstract: Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), if exist in nature, are expected to mix with\nphotons in the presence of an external magnetic field. The energy range of\nphotons which undergo strong mixing with ALPs depends on the ALP mass, on its\ncoupling with photons as well as on the external magnetic field and particle\ndensity configurations. Recent observations of blazars by the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope in the 0.1-300 GeV energy range show a break in their spectra\nin the 1-10 GeV range. We have modeled this spectral feature for the\nflat-spectrum radio quasar 3C454.3 during its November 2010 outburst, assuming\nthat a significant fraction of the gamma rays convert to ALPs in the large\nscale jet of this blazar. Using theoretically motivated models for the magnetic\nfield and particle density configurations in the kiloparsec scale jet, outside\nthe broad-line region, we find an ALP mass $m_a\\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-7}$ eV and\ncoupling $g_{a\\gamma} \\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ after performing an\nillustrative statistical analysis of spectral data in four different epochs of\nemission.

MiniBooNE also observed a $3.4 \\sigma$\nexcess of events in their neutrino mode data.

We discuss the idea of using the\nMAC-E-Filter in a time-of-flight mode (MAC-E-TOF) in which the neutrino mass is\ndetermined by a measurement of the electron time-of-flight (TOF) spectrum that\ndepends on the neutrino mass. MAC-E-TOF spectroscopy here is a very sensitive\nmethod since the $\\beta$-electrons are slowed down to distinguishable\nvelocities by the MAC-E-Filter. Their velocity depends strongly on their\nsurplus energy above the electric retarding potential. Using MAC-E-TOF, a\nstatistical sensitivity gain is expected. Because a small number of\nretarding-potential settings is sufficient for a complete measurement, in\ncontrast to about 40 different retarding potentials used in the standard\nMAC-E-Filter mode, there is a gain in measurement time and hence statistical\npower. The improvement of the statistical uncertainty of the squared neutrino\nmass has been determined by Monte Carlo simulation to be a factor 5 for an\nideal case neglecting background and timing uncertainty.

At hadron colliders the dominant\nfraction of hits is due to low momentum tracks for which multiple scattering\n(MS) effects dominate the hit resolution. MS is also the dominating source for\nhit confusion and track uncertainties in low energy precision experiments. In\nall such environments, where MS dominates, track reconstruction and fitting can\nbe largely simplified by using three-dimensional (3D) hit-triplets as provided\nby pixel detectors. This simplification is possible since track uncertainties\nare solely determined by MS if high precision spatial information is provided.\nFitting of hit-triplets is especially simple for tracking detectors in\nsolenoidal magnetic fields. The over-constrained 3D-triplet method provides a\ncomplete set of track parameters and is robust against fake hit combinations.\nThe triplet method is ideally suited for pixel detectors where hits can be\ntreated as 3D-space points. With the advent of relatively cheap and\nindustrially available CMOS-sensors the construction of highly granular full\nscale pixel tracking detectors seems to be possible also for experiments at LHC\nor future high energy (hadron) colliders.

In the LHC Run 1, this trigger, which\nutilized a custom boosted decision tree algorithm, selected a nearly 100% pure\nsample of b-hadrons with a typical efficiency of 60-70%; its output was used in\nabout 60% of LHCb papers.

A recombination model is\ndeveloped to explain the recombination probability as a function of recoil\nenergy at zero field and non-zero field. The role of e-ion recombination is\ndiscussed for both parent recombination and volume recombination. We find that\nthe volume recombination under non-zero field is constrained by a plasma\neffect, which is caused by a high density of charge carriers along the\nionization track forming a plasma-like cloud of charge that shields the\ninterior from the influence of the external electric field. Subsequently, the\nplasma time that determines the volume recombination probability at non-zero\nfield is demonstrated to be different between electronic recoils and nuclear\nrecoils due to the difference of ionization density between two processes. We\nshow a weak field-dependence of the plasma time for nuclear recoils and a\nstronger field-dependence of the plasma time for electronic recoils. As a\nresult, the time-dependent recombination is implemented in the determination of\ncharge and light yield with a generic model. Our model agrees well with the\navailable experimental data from xenon-based dark matter experiments. \n\n"}

This\ndetermination relies on the calculation of deep-inelastic structure functions\nin the FONLL scheme, generalized to account for massive charm-initiated\ncontributions. In contrast to the usual situation in which the charm PDF is\nassumed to be generated perturbatively by pair radiation off gluons and light\nquarks, vanishing at a scale set by the value of the charm mass m_c, we find\nthat the fitted charm PDF vanishes within uncertainties at a scale Q~1.5 GeV\nfor all x<~0.1, independent of the value of m_c used in the coefficient\nfunctions. We also find some evidence that the charm PDF at large x>~0.1 and\nlow scales does not vanish, but rather has an \"intrinsic\" component, very\nweakly scale dependent and almost independent of the value of m_c, carrying\nabout 1% of the total momentum of the proton. The uncertainties in all other\nPDFs are only slightly increased by the inclusion of fitted charm, while the\ndependence of these PDFs on m_c is significantly reduced. When the EMC charm\nstructure function dataset is included, it is well described by the fit, and\nPDF uncertainties in the fitted charm PDF are significantly reduced, though we\nverify that excluding the EMC data does not qualitatively modify any of our\nfindings.

This suggests that a\nnon-trivial version of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) may also apply to\ngauge symmetries that are discrete, despite there being no associated massless\nfield, therefore pushing the conjecture beyond the slogan that `gravity is the\nweakest force'. Here, we take a step towards making this expectation more\nprecise by studying $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2^N$ gauge symmetries\nrealised via theories of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

In this setting, considering the\neffect of discrete hair on black holes naturally identifies the cutoff of the\neffective theory with the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and provides\na mechanism through which discrete hair can be lost without modifying the\ngravitational sector. We explore the possible implications of these arguments\nfor understanding the smallness of the weak scale compared to $M_{Pl}$. \n\n"}

During inflation, the vacuum remains\nin the unbroken GUT phase, and GUT symmetry breaking occurs later when a field\nwith a flat direction (the flaton) acquires a vacuum expectation value.\nInflaton decay and the reheating process depend crucially on GUT symmetry\nbreaking, as decay channels open and close, depending on the value of the\nflaton vacuum expectation value. Here, we consider the simultaneous\ncosmological evolution of both the inflaton and flaton fields after inflation.\nWe distinguish weak, moderate and strong reheating regimes, and calculate in\neach case the entropy produced as all fields settle to their global minima.\nThese three reheating scenarios differ in the value of a Yukawa coupling that\nintroduces mass mixing between the singlets and the ${\\bf 10}$s of SU(5).

The essential effect of\nhaving noncommutative co-ordinates in this approach is to smear out matter\ndistributions on a scale associated with the turn-on of noncommutativity which\nwas taken to be near the 4-d Planck mass. In particular, NSS took this smearing\nto be essentially Gaussian. This energy scale is sufficiently large that in 4-d\nsuch effects may remain invisible indefinitely. Extra dimensional models which\nattempt to address the gauge hierarchy problem, however, allow for the\npossibility that the effective fundamental scale may not be far from $\\sim$ 1\nTeV, an energy regime that will soon be probed by experiments at both the LHC\nand ILC. In this paper we generalize the NSS model to the case where flat,\ntoroidally compactified extra dimensions are accessible at the Terascale and\nexamine the resulting modifications in black hole properties due to the\nexistence of noncommutativity.

Abstract: I propose that the properties of QCD perturbation theory should be\ninvestigated when the boundary state (`perturbative vacuum') at $t= \\pm\\infty$\nincludes gluons.

Through an analogy with the boundary condition corresponding\nto a fermion condensate, I propose an explicit form for a `perturbative gluon\ncondensate' that suppresses low momentum gluon production, thus generating an\neffective mass gap.

In this framework, the\ngravitational and gauge interactions become united at the weak scale, which we\ntake as the only fundamental short distance scale in nature. The observed\nweakness of gravity on distances $\\gsim$ 1 mm is due to the existence of $n\n\\geq 2$ new compact spatial dimensions large compared to the weak scale. The\nPlanck scale $M_{Pl} \\sim G_N^{-1/2}$ is not a fundamental scale; its enormity\nis simply a consequence of the large size of the new dimensions. While\ngravitons can freely propagate in the new dimensions, at sub-weak energies the\nStandard Model (SM) fields must be localized to a 4-dimensional manifold of\nweak scale \"thickness\" in the extra dimensions. This picture leads to a number\nof striking signals for accelerator and laboratory experiments.

We show the efficiencies achieved for particle identification and\nthe associated fake rates from data collected with both CLEO III and CLEO-c\ndetectors. Finally we show examples of the particle separation ability which is\nexcellent for both CLEO III and CLEO-c data. \n\n"}

With L = 100 fb^-1 at\nsqrt(s) = 350 GeV a relative error of around 10^{-4} is possible. The\npotentially largest systematic uncertainty comes from the knowledge of the\naspect ratio of the detector. \n\n"}

The significance calculation of an observation\nof a physics signal with known location and shape is no longer valid when\neither the location or the shape of the signal is unknown. We find the current\nLHC significance calculation of new physics is over-estimated and strongly\ndepends on the specifics of the method and the situation it applies to. We\ndescribe general procedures for significance calculation and comparing\ndifferent search schemes. A new method uses maximum likelihood fits with\nfloating parameters and scans the parameter space for the best fit to the\nentire sample. We find that the new method is significantly more sensitive than\ncurrent method and is insensitive to the exact location of the new physics\nsignal we search. \n\n"}

As the data samples are getting larger, systematic\nuncertainties due to the measurement of the jet energy scale assessed using the\ncalorimeter simulation have become increasingly important. In many years of\noperation, the collaboration has gained experience with GFLASH, a fast\nparametrization of electromagnetic and hadronic showers used for the\ncalorimeter simulation. We present the performance of the calorimeter\nsimulation and report on recent improvements based on a refined in situ tuning\ntechnique. The central calorimeter response is reproduced with a precision of\n1-2%. \n\n"}
