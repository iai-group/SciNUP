J/psi suppression\nmechanisms based on energy density (such as color screening, interaction with\nco-movers, etc.) predict the opposite trend. On the other hand, it is expected\nthat more c\\bar{c} pairs should be available to form quarkonia at mid-rapidity\nvia recombination. Some models provide a way to differentiate J/psi production\nfrom initially produced c\\bar{c} pairs and final state recombination of\nuncorrelated pairs, via the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the\nelliptic flow (v2).\n  During 2007 data taking at RHIC, a large sample of Au+Au collisions at\nsqrt(sNN)=200 GeV was collected. The statistics has been increased compared to\nprevious 2004 data set, thus allowing a more precise measurement of the J/psi\nproduction at both mid and forward rapidity. Furthermore, the PHENIX experiment\nbenefited from the addition of a new detector, which improves the reaction\nplane resolution and allows us to measure the J/psi v2. Comparing this\nmeasurement to the positive D-mesons v2 (through non-photonic electron decays)\nwill help constraining the J/psi production mechanisms and getting a more\nprecise picture of the proportion of J/psi coming from direct production or\ncharm quark coalescence.\n  Details on how the J/psi v2 is measured at both rapidities are presented.

Measurements and comparison with relativistic hydrodynamic models\nindicate that the matter thermalizes in an unexpectedly short time, has an\nenergy density at least 15 times larger than needed for color deconfinement,\nhas a temperature about twice the critical temperature predicted by lattice\nQCD, and appears to exhibit collective motion with ideal hydrodynamic\nproperties - a \"perfect liquid\" that appears to flow with a near-zero viscosity\nto entropy ratio - lower than any previously observed fluid and perhaps close\nto a universal lower bound.

It is found that for the RHIC initial\nconditions the very same framework that reproduces the standard soft\nobservables (including the transverse-momentum spectra, the elliptic flow, and\nthe azimuthally-averaged HBT radii) leads to a proper description of the\nazimuthally-sensitive femtoscopic observables - we find that the azimuthal\nvariation of the side and out HBT radii is very well reproduced for all\ncentralities, while the out-side correlation is somewhat too large for\nnon-central events.

In\ncontrasting this behaviour with that produced by a momentum-dependent\ninteraction, one achieves comparisons which highlight that elastic scattering\nand resonance electroproduction experiments probe the infrared evolution of\nQCD's running masses; e.g., the existence, and location if so, of a zero in the\nratio of nucleon Sachs form factors are strongly influenced by the running of\nthe dressed-quark mass. In our description of baryons, diquark correlations are\nimportant. These correlations are instrumental in producing a zero in the Dirac\nform factor of the proton's d-quark; and in determining d_v/u_v(x=1), as we\nshow via a formula that expresses d_v/u_v(x=1) in terms of the nucleon's\ndiquark content.

However, the SM fails to explain the non-visible but\ngravitationally active part of the universe. Its nature is unknown but the\nconfirmation of a scalar Higgs is giving a boost to scalar-field-theories. So\nfar gravity experiments and observations performed at different distances find\nno deviation from Newton's gravity law. Therefore dark energy must possess a\nscreening mechanism which suppresses the scalar-mediated fifth force. Our line\nof attack is a novel gravity experiment with neutrons based on a quantum\ninterference technique. The spectroscopic measurement of quantum states on\nresonances with an external coupling makes this a powerful search for dark\nmatter and dark energy contributions in the universe. Quantum states in the\ngravity potential are intimately related to other scalar field or spin-0-bosons\nif they exist. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interact with a\nneutron, this results in a measurable energy shift of quantum states in the\ngravity potential, because for neutrons the screening effect is absent.

The transition is studied using the Polyakov loop model, with\nthe initial field configuration (in the confining phase) covering a small\nneighborhood of the confining vacuum $l \\simeq 0$, as appropriate for $T <\nT_c$. Quench is implemented by evolving this initial configuration with the\neffective potential at a temperature $T > T_c$. We study the formation of Z(3)\ndomain structure and its evolution during the transition as $l$ rolls down in\ndifferent directions from the top of the central hill in the effective\npotential of $l$. When explicit Z(3) symmetry breaking effects (arising from\ndynamical quark effects) are small, then we find well defined Z(3) domains\nwhich coarsen in time. Remarkably, the magnitude plot of $l$ shows vacuum\nbubble like configurations arising during the quench. This first order\ntransition like behavior occurs even though there is no metastable vacuum\nseparated by a barrier from the true vacuum for the parameter values used. When\nthe initial field configuration everywhere rolls down roughly along the same\ndirection (as will happen with large explicit symmetry breaking) then we do not\nfind such bubble-like configurations. However, in this case we find huge\noscillations of $l$ with large length scales. We show that such large\noscillations can lead to large fluctuations in the evolution of flow\nanisotropies compared to the equilibrium transition case. \n\n"}

For such kinematics\nwe use the QCD factorization approach formulated in the framework of the\nsoft-collinear effective theory (SCET).

The momentum region where both photons are hard is\ndescribed by only one new nonperturbative SCET form factor. It turns out that\nthe same form factor also arises for wide-angle Compton scattering which is\nalso described in the framework of the SCET approach. This allows us to\nestimate the soft-spectator contribution associated with the hard photons in a\nmodel independent way.\n  The main unknown in our description of the TPE contribution is related with\nthe configuration where one photon is soft.

In that scenario, we show that accommodating the muon\ng-2 data through relaxation of K decay constraints leads to interesting signals\nfor dark parity violation.

While the EOS is still poorly known, there are\nalso longstanding ambiguities in choosing General Relativity or alternative\ngravity theories in the not-so-well tested strong-field regime. Besides\npossible appearance of hyperons and new phases, the most uncertain part of the\nnucleonic EOS is currently the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy.\nTo provide information that may help break the EOS-gravity degeneracy, we\ninvestigate effects of symmetry energy within its uncertain range determined by\nterrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments on the gravitational binding energy\nand spacetime curvature of neutron stars within GR and the scalar-tensor (ST)\ntheory of gravity. In particular, we focus on effects of the following\nparameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter: (1) the\nincompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter, (2) the slope $L$ of\nsymmetry energy at saturation density and (3) the high-density behavior of\nsymmetry energy. We find that the variation of either the density slope $L$ or\nthe high-density behavior of symmetry energy leads to large changes in both the\nbinding energy and curvature of neutron stars while effects of varying the more\nconstrained $K_0$ are negligibly small. The difference in predictions using the\nGR and the ST theory appears only for massive neutron stars, and is\nsignificantly smaller than the differences resulting from variations in the\nsymmetry energy. We conclude that within the ST theory of gravity, the\nEOS-gravity degeneracy has been broken by the recent relativistic pulsar\nmeasurements, and that measurements of neutron star properties sensitive to the\ncompactness constrain mainly the density dependence of the symmetry energy. \n\n"}

The theoretical analysis of these data\nconfirms the onset of the high energy eikonal regime in the scattering process\nwhich allows one to separate long range nuclear effects from the effects\ngenuinely related to the short distance structure of the deuteron.

The existing background subtraction methods for these studies depend on\nseveral assumptions and independent measurements of the Fourier coefficients of\nthe combinatorial background.

To test the accuracy of these methods, a simple model is used to\nsimulate di-hadron and jet-hadron correlations with a combinatorial background\nsimilar to that observed in the data.

In turn, pion\nproperties suggest that confinement & DCSB are closely connected. As both a\nNambu-Goldstone boson and a quark-antiquark bound-state, the pion is unique in\nNature. Developing an understanding of its properties is thus critical to\nrevealing basic features of the Standard Model. We describe experimental\nprogress in this direction, made using electromagnetic probes, highlighting\nboth improvements in the precision of charged-pion form factor data, achieved\nin the past decade, and new results on the neutral-pion transition form factor.\nBoth challenge existing notions of pion structure. We also provide a\ntheoretical context for these empirical advances, first explaining how DCSB\nworks to guarantee that the pion is unnaturally light; but also, nevertheless,\nensures the pion is key to revealing the mechanisms that generate nearly all\nthe mass of hadrons.

Those experiments will extend precise\ncharged-pion form factor data to momenta that can potentially serve in\nvalidating factorisation theorems in QCD, exposing the transition between the\nnonperturbative and perturbative domains, and thereby reaching a goal that has\nlong driven hadro-particle physics. \n\n"}

We introduce a new semi-inclusive fragmenting jet function\n${\\mathcal G}^h_i(z= \\omega_J/\\omega,z_h=\\omega_h/\\omega_J,\\omega_J, R,\\mu)$,\nwhich depends on the jet radius $R$ and the large light-cone momenta of the\nparton `$i$' initiating the jet ($\\omega$), the jet ($\\omega_J$), and the\nhadron $h$ ($\\omega_h$). The jet fragmentation function can then be expressed\nas a semi-inclusive observable, in the spirit of actual experimental\nmeasurements, rather than as an exclusive one. We demonstrate the consistency\nof the effective field theory treatment and standard perturbative QCD\ncalculations of this observable at next-to-leading order (NLO).

Here, we argue that modern jet substructure\nmeasurements can improve this situation qualitatively since they are sensitive\nto the momentum distribution inside the jet. We show that the groomed subjet\nshared momentum fraction $z_g$, and the girth of leading and subleading subjets\nsignal recoil effects with dependencies that are absent in a recoilless\nbaseline. We find that recoil effects can explain most of the medium\nmodifications to the $z_g$ distribution observed in data. Furthermore, for jets\npassing the Soft Drop Condition, recoil effects induce in the differential\ndistribution of subjet separation $\\Delta R_{12}$ a characteristic increase\nwith $\\Delta R_{12}$, and they introduce a characteristic enhancement of the\ngirth of the subleading subjet with decreasing $z_g$.

We turn then to describing\nequations of state useful for interpretation of both electromagnetic and\ngravitational observations, reviewing the emerging picture of hadron-quark\ncontinuity in which hadronic matter turns relatively smoothly, with at most\nonly a weak first order transition, into quark matter with increasing density.\nWe review construction of unified equations of state that interpolate between\nthe reasonably well understood nuclear matter regime at low densities and the\nquark matter regime at higher densities. The utility of such interpolations is\ndriven by the present inability to calculate the dense matter equation of state\nin QCD from first principles. As we review, the parameters of effective quark\nmodels -- which have direct relevance to the more general structure of the QCD\nphase diagram of dense and hot matter -- are constrained by neutron star mass\nand radii measurements, in particular favoring large repulsive density-density\nand attractive diquark pairing interactions.

All combinations of input functions\nand fit functions can then be tested repeatedly against regenerated\npseudo-data.

A systematic study of the beam energy dependence is performed for Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =2.3 - 62.4$ GeV. The transition of the dynamical\norigin of the directed flow is observed. We find that the initial Glauber type\nnucleon-nucleon collisions generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons at midrapidity\ndue to the presence of spectator matter, and this negative nucleon $v_1$ is\nturned to be positive by the meson-baryon interactions at the beam energy\nregion of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 30$ GeV.

Abstract: Recent measurements of the cosmic ray (CR) antiproton flux have been shown to\nchallenge existing CR propagation models. It was shown that the reacceleration\nmodels designed to match secondary to primary nuclei ratios (e.g.,\nboron/carbon) produce too few antiprotons. Matching both the secondary to\nprimary nuclei ratio and the antiproton flux requires artificial breaks in the\ndiffusion coefficient and the primary injection spectrum suggesting the need\nfor other approaches.\n  In the present paper we discuss one possibility to overcome these\ndifficulties. Using the measured antiproton flux AND B/C ratio to fix the\ndiffusion coefficient, we show that the spectra of primary nuclei as measured\nin the heliosphere may contain a fresh local \"unprocessed\" component at low\nenergies perhaps associated with the Local Bubble, thus decreasing the measured\nsecondary to primary nuclei ratio. The independent evidence for SN activity in\nthe solar vicinity in the last few Myr supports this idea. The model reproduces\nantiprotons, B/C ratio, and elemental abundances up to Ni (Z<=28).

Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory governing the strong interaction\nof particles. It describes the interactions that bind quarks and gluons into\nprotons and neutrons, and binds these into nuclei. We believe QCD to be as\nfundamental and complete as QED, the theory of electromagnetic interactions,\nwhose predictions have been tested to more than ten decimal places. If it were\npossible to make calculations in QCD the same way we can in QED, we would have\nremoved one of the biggest obstacles in the way of understanding matter in the\nuniverse. Unfortunately, the properties of QCD make such calculations\nimpossible at present. Historically, there have been two approaches to this\nproblem. First, we work to improve our ability to solve QCD, with the most\nvisible effort being the field of Lattice QCD. Second, we make models of QCD\nthat attempt to incorporate what we believe to be the most important\nsymmetries, dynamics, or degrees of freedom, and then test these models against\nexperimental measurements sensitive to these assumptions. Even the earliest\nquark models of hadrons structure and the simplest bag models have had great\nsuccess, far beyond any reasonable expectation, indicating that these models\nhave isolated some of the key features of QCD. More detailed models and ever\nmore sophisticated experimental tests are significantly improving such details,\nand helping to better identify the most relevant features of QCD, one of the\nkey missing pieces in our understanding of the nature of matter. \n\n"}
