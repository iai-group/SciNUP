For the free damped particle it has been shown, however,\nthat the ensuing specific heat may become negative for appropriately chosen\nenvironments.

We provide a formalism\nthat is local in the following very specific sense: calculations pertaining to\nany region of spacetime employ only mathematical objects associated with that\nregion. We call this \"formalism locality\". It incorporates the idea that space\nand time should be treated on an equal footing. Formulations that use a\nfoliation of spacetime to evolve a state do not have this property nor do\nhistories-based approaches. An operation (see figure on left) has inputs and\noutputs (through which systems travel). A circuit is built by wiring together\noperations such that we have no open inputs or outputs left over. A fragment\n(see figure on right) is a part of a circuit and may have open inputs and\noutputs. We show how each operation is associated with a certain mathematical\nobject which we call a \"duotensor\" (this is like a tensor but with a bit more\nstructure).

Abstract: Hawking radiation and Bekenstein--Hawking entropy are the two robust\npredictions of a yet unknown quantum theory of gravity. Any theory which fails\nto reproduce these predictions is certainly incorrect. While several approaches\nlead to Bekenstein--Hawking entropy, they all lead to different sub-leading\ncorrections.

Such numbers are in general uncomputable using any\nreal-world resources, and, if we have the idea of physical law as some kind of\ncomputational algorithm of the universe, we would be compelled to alter our\ndescriptions of physics to be consistent with computable numbers. Our purpose\nhere is to examine the geometric implications of using finite fields Fp and\nfinite complexified fields Fp^2 (based on primes p congruent to 3 mod{4}) as\nthe basis for computations in a theory of discrete quantum computing, which\nwould therefore become a computable theory. Because the states of a discrete\nn-qubit system are in principle enumerable, we are able to determine the\nproportions of entangled and unentangled states. In particular, we extend the\nHopf fibration that defines the irreducible state space of conventional\ncontinuous n-qubit theories (which is the complex projective space CP{2^{n}-1})\nto an analogous discrete geometry in which the Hopf circle for any n is found\nto be a discrete set of p+1 points.

As a consequence, there is a prima facie argument exploiting\nentanglement that CTC interactions would enable superluminal and, indeed,\neffectively instantaneous signaling. In cases of spacelike separation between\nthe sender of a signal and the receiver, whether a receiver measures the local\npart of an entangled state or a disentangled state to access the signal can\ndepend on the reference frame. We propose a consistency condition that gives\npriority to either an entangled perspective or a disentangled perspective in\nspacelike separated scenarios.

The microscopic\nmomentum exchanged generates two mirror substates which interfere to produce\nfringes which do not vanish as the mirror mass increases. The small\ndisplacement between these mirror states can yield negligible environmental\ndecoherence times. Mirror coherence lengths impose constraints on the extent of\nthis interference, which are mitigated using interference of the two-body\nstates associated with the particle reflecting from both of the two surfaces of\na slab of matter in a manner analogous to the classical interference of a pulse\nof light reflecting from a `thin film'.

Adding chiral\nfunctionalities to nanophotonic waveguides lead to new opportunities enabling\nintegrated and robust quantum-photonic devices or the observation of novel\ntopological photonic states. In a regular waveguide, a quantum emitter radiates\nphotons in either of two directions, and photon emission and absorption are\nreverse processes. This symmetry is violated in nanophotonic structures where a\nnon-transversal local electric field implies that both photon emission and\nscattering may become directional.

The information is defined as\nthe classical Fisher information obtained by the measurement, and the\ndisturbance is defined as the average loss of the quantum Fisher information.\nWe show that pure and reversible measurements achieve the equality of the\ninequality. We also identify the necessary condition for various divergences\nbetween two quantum states to satisfy a similar relation.

We present and\nanalyze several counterexamples from the class of perturbed Hamming-weight\noptimization problems with qubit permutation symmetry. We first show that, for\nthese problems, the adiabatic dynamics that make tunneling possible should be\nunderstood not in terms of the cost function but rather the semi-classical\npotential arising from the spin-coherent path integral formalism. We then\nprovide an example where the shape of the barrier in the final cost function is\nshort and wide, which might suggest no quantum advantage for QA, yet where\ntunneling renders QA superior to simulated annealing in the adiabatic regime.\nHowever, the adiabatic dynamics turn out not be optimal. Instead, an evolution\ninvolving a sequence of diabatic transitions through many avoided\nlevel-crossings, involving no tunneling, is optimal and outperforms adiabatic\nQA. We show that this phenomenon of speedup by diabatic transitions is not\nunique to this example, and we provide an example where it provides an\nexponential speedup over adiabatic QA. In yet another twist, we show that a\nclassical algorithm, spin vector dynamics, is at least as efficient as diabatic\nQA. Finally, in a different example with a convex cost function, the diabatic\ntransitions result in a speedup relative to both adiabatic QA with tunneling\nand classical spin vector dynamics. \n\n"}

The optical trapping mechanism is based on the\ninteraction energy of a dipole and the electric field of the laser light. In\natom trapping, the dominant contribution typically comes from the allowed\noptical transition closest to the laser wavelength, whereas for mesoscopic\nparticles it is given by the bulk polarizability of the material. These two\ndifferent regimes of optical trapping have coexisted for decades without any\ndirect link, resulting in two very different contexts of applications: one\nbeing the trapping of small objects mainly in biological settings, the other\none being dipole traps for individual neutral atoms in the field of quantum\noptics.

These asymptotic series then\nrequire the use of resurgence and transseries in order for the associated\nobservables to become nonperturbatively well-defined. Resurgence encodes the\ncomplete large-order asymptotic behaviour of the coefficients from a\nperturbative expansion, generically in terms of (multi) instanton sectors and\nfor each problem in terms of its Stokes constants. Some observables arise from\nlinear problems, and have a finite number of instanton sectors and associated\nStokes constants; some other observables arise from nonlinear problems, and\nhave an infinite number of instanton sectors and Stokes constants.

States\nrepresented in this way, called Neural Network States (NNSs), were shown to\ndisplay interesting properties like the ability to efficiently capture\nlong-range quantum correlations. However, identifying an optimal neural network\nrepresentation of a given state might be challenging, and so far this problem\nhas been addressed with stochastic optimization techniques. In this work we\nexplore a different direction. We study how the action of elementary quantum\noperations modifies NNSs. We parametrize a family of many body quantum\noperations that can be directly applied to states represented by Unrestricted\nBoltzmann Machines, by just adding hidden nodes and updating the network\nparameters. We show that this parametrization contains a set of universal\nquantum gates, from which it follows that the state prepared by any quantum\ncircuit can be expressed as a Neural Network State with a number of hidden\nnodes that grows linearly with the number of elementary operations in the\ncircuit. This is a powerful representation theorem (which was recently obtained\nwith different methods) but that is not directly useful, since there is no\ngeneral and efficient way to extract information from this unrestricted\ndescription of quantum states.

Abstract: Quantum computational supremacy arguments, which describe a way for a quantum\ncomputer to perform a task that cannot also be done by a classical computer,\ntypically require some sort of computational assumption related to the\nlimitations of classical computation. One common assumption is that the\npolynomial hierarchy (PH) does not collapse, a stronger version of the\nstatement that P $\\neq$ NP, which leads to the conclusion that any classical\nsimulation of certain families of quantum circuits requires time scaling worse\nthan any polynomial in the size of the circuits. However, the asymptotic nature\nof this conclusion prevents us from calculating exactly how many qubits these\nquantum circuits must have for their classical simulation to be intractable on\nmodern classical supercomputers. We refine these quantum computational\nsupremacy arguments and perform such a calculation by imposing fine-grained\nversions of the non-collapse assumption. Each version is parameterized by a\nconstant $a$ and asserts that certain specific computational problems with\ninput size $n$ require $2^{an}$ time steps to be solved by a non-deterministic\nalgorithm.

The impurity contribution to the uniform part of the entanglement\nentropy, S_{imp}, is defined and analyzed in detail in both the gapless, J_2 <=\nJ_2^c, as well as the dimerized phase, J_2>J_2^c, of the model. This quantum\nimpurity model is in the universality class of the single channel Kondo model\nand it is shown that in a quite universal way the presence of the impurity in\nthe gapless phase, J_2 <= J_2^c, gives rise to a large length scale, xi_K,\nassociated with the screening of the impurity, the size of the Kondo screening\ncloud. The universality of Kondo physics then implies scaling of the form\nS_{imp}(r/xi_K,r/R) for a system of size R. Numerical results are presented\nclearly demonstrating this scaling. At the critical point, J_2^c, an analytic\nFermi liquid picture is developed and analytic results are obtained both at T=0\nand T>0.

The nuclear spin bath, because of its bifurcated\nevolution predicated on the electron spin up or down state, measures the\nwhich-state information of the electron spin and hence diminishes its\ncoherence. The many-body dynamics of nuclear spin bath is solved with a\npair-correlation approximation. In the relevant timescale, nuclear pair-wise\nflip-flops, as elementary excitations in the mesoscopic bath, can be mapped\ninto the precession of non-interacting pseudo-spins. Such mapping provides a\ngeometrical picture for understanding the decoherence and for devising control\nschemes.
