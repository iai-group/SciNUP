Existing literature on frequentist quantum estimation has not\nrigorously examined the finite sample performance of the estimators and\nassociated methods of hypothesis testing. While ML is usually preferred on the\nbasis of its asymptotic properties - it achieves the Cramer-Rao (CR) lower\nbound - the finite sample properties are often less than optimal.

In contrast to the control of classical systems\nwhere the measurement effect is negligible, the quantum measurement will cause\na quantum state to collapse, which will inevitably introduce additional\nuncertainties besides the system initial uncertainty. Therefore, there is a\ncomplicated tradeoff between the uncertainty introduced and the information\ngained by the measurement, and thus a theoretical investigation of the\ncapability of MFC is of fundamental importance. In this paper, inspired by both\nthe Heisenberg uncertainty principle for quantum systems and the investigation\nof the feedback capability for classical systems, we try to answer the\nfollowing three basic questions: (i) How to choose the measurement channel\nappropriately?

The particle's motion is hindered in the x-y\ndirections, allowing tunneling of particles through the walls, while no\nconfinement along the z direction is considered. It is shown that there exists\na finite Bose- Einstein condensation (BEC) critical temperature Tc that\ndecreases monotonically from the 3D ideal boson gas (IBG) value $T_{0}$ as the\nstrength of confinement $P_{0}$ is increased while keeping the channel's cross\nsection, $a_{x}a_{y}$ constant. In contrast, Tc is a non-monotonic function of\nthe cross-section area for fixed $P_{0}$. In addition to the BEC cusp, the\nspecific heat exhibits a set of maxima and minima.

This\nprogress is based mostly on a successful isolation of the qubits from external\ndecoherence sources obtained by clever engineering. Under these conditions, the\nmaterial-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial role.

In the limit of infinitely frequent monitoring, the state never\nescapes from the region -- this is the Zeno effect. The aim of this paper is to\nshow how the Zeno effect disappears in the classical limit in this and similar\nexamples. We give a general argument showing that the Zeno effect is suppressed\nin the presence of a decoherence mechanism which kills interference between\nhistories. We show how this works explicitly by coupling to a decohering\nenvironment. Smoothed projectors are required to give the problem proper\ndefinition and this implies the existence of a momentum cutoff. We show that\nthe escape rate from the region approaches the classically expected result, and\nhence the Zeno effect is suppressed, as long as the environmentally-induced\nfluctuations in momentum are sufficiently large and we establish the associated\ntimescale. We link our results to earlier work on the hbar -->0 limit of the\nZeno effect. We illustrate our results by plotting the probability flux lines\nfor the density matrix (which are equivalent to Bohm trajectories in the pure\nstate case).

The theory of contextuality known as\nContextuality-by-Default allows one to define and measure contextuality in all\nsuch system, even if there are context-dependent errors in measurements, or if\nsomething in the contexts directly interacts with the measurements. This makes\nthe theory especially suitable for behavioral and social systems, where direct\ninteractions of \"everything with everything\" are ubiquitous.

Firstly, we\ndemonstrate that the Purcell effect can be effectively suppressed for an\nexcited atom near a cloaking device. Furthermore, the decay rate of a quantum\nemitter near a graphene-coated wall under the influence of an external magnetic\nfield is studied. We show that the MO properties of graphene strongly affect\nthe atomic lifetime and that B allows for an unprecedented control of the decay\nchannels of the system.

Our methods\nare even more general. They can be used to shift a Hamiltonian's density of\nstates away from the ground state, so that fewer states occupy the low-lying\nenergies near the minimum, hence allowing for faster adiabatic passages to find\nthe ground state with less risk of getting caught in an undesired low-lying\nexcited state during the passage. Even more generally, our methods can be used\nto transform a discrete optimization problem into a new one whose unique\nminimum still encodes the desired answer, but with the objective function's\nvalues forming a different landscape. Aspects of the landscape such as the\nobjective function's range, or the values of certain coefficients, or how many\ndifferent inputs lead to a given output value, can be decreased *or* increased.\nOne of the many examples for which these methods are useful is in finding the\nground state of a Hamiltonian using NMR: If it is difficult to find a molecule\nsuch that the distances between the spins match the interactions in the\nHamiltonian, the interactions in the Hamiltonian can be changed without at all\nchanging the ground state.

Abstract: The definition of the classical transition state theory (TST) as a t= 0+\nlimit of the flux-side time correlation function relies on the assumption that\nsimultaneous measurement of population and flux is a well defined physical\nprocess. However, the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum\nmechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime\nimpossible. For this reason, quantum TST (QTST) has been generally accepted as\nany kind of quantum rate theory reproducing the TST in the classical limit, and\nthere has been a broad consensus that no unique QTST retaining all the\nproperties of TST can be defined. Hele and Althorpe (HA) [J. Chem. Phys. 138,\n084108 (2013)] recently suggested that a true QTST can be defined as the exact\nt=0+ limit of a certain kind of quantum flux-side time correlation function and\nthat it is equivalent to the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) TST. This\nwork seeks to question and clarify certain assumptions underlying these\nsuggestions and their implications. First, the time correlation function used\nby HA as a starting expression is not related to the kinetic rate constant by\nvirtue of linear response theory, which is the first important step in relating\na t=0+ limit to a physically measurable rate. Second, a theoretical analysis\ncalls into question a key step in HA's proof which appears not to rely on an\nexact quantum mechanical identity. The correction of this makes the true t=0+\nlimit of HA's QTST different from the RPMD-TST rate expression, but rather\nequal to the well-known path integral quantum transition state theory rate\nexpression for the case of centroid dividing surface. An alternative path\nintegral quantum rate expression is then formulated based on the linear\nresponse theory. It is shown that the t=0+ limit of the new rate expression\nvanishes in the exact quantum limit. \n\n"}

We do this by first\nconstructing a holographic $c$-function using causal horizon in the black brane\ngeometry. The UV value of the $c$-function is $a_{UV}$ and then it decreases\nmonotonically to zero at the curvature singularity. Intuitively, the behavior\nof the $c$-function can be understood if we recognize that the dual CFT is in a\nthermal state and thermal states are effectively massive with a gap set by the\ntemperature. In field theory, logarithmic entanglement negativity is an\nentanglement measure for mixed states. For example, in two dimensional CFTs on\ninfinite line at finite temperature, the renormalized entanglement negativity\nof an interval has UV (Low- T) value $c_{UV}$ and IR (High-T) value zero. So\nthis is a potential candidate for our $c$-function. In four dimensions we\nexpect the same thing to hold on physical grounds. Now since the causal horizon\ngoes behind the black brane horizon the holographic $c$-function is sensitive\nto the physics of the interior. Correspondingly the field theory $c$-function\nshould also contain information about the interior. So our results suggest that\nhigh temperature (IR) expansion of the negativity (or any candidate\n$c$-function) may be a way to probe part of the physics near the singularity.\nNegativity at finite temperature depends on the full operator content of the\ntheory and so perhaps this can be be done in specific cases only.\n  The existence of this $c$-function in the bulk is an extreme example of the\nparadigm that space-time is built out of entanglement. In particular the fact\nthat the $c$-function reaches zero at the curvature singularity correlates the\ntwo facts : loss of quantum entanglement in the IR field theory and the end of\ngeometry in the bulk which in this case is the formation of curvature\nsingularity. \n\n"}

In particular, experiments\nwith ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices subjected to periodic driving\nin the lower kilohertz regime have attracted a lot of attention.

States\nrepresented in this way, called Neural Network States (NNSs), were shown to\ndisplay interesting properties like the ability to efficiently capture\nlong-range quantum correlations. However, identifying an optimal neural network\nrepresentation of a given state might be challenging, and so far this problem\nhas been addressed with stochastic optimization techniques.

We parametrize a family of many body quantum\noperations that can be directly applied to states represented by Unrestricted\nBoltzmann Machines, by just adding hidden nodes and updating the network\nparameters. We show that this parametrization contains a set of universal\nquantum gates, from which it follows that the state prepared by any quantum\ncircuit can be expressed as a Neural Network State with a number of hidden\nnodes that grows linearly with the number of elementary operations in the\ncircuit.

Nonzero imaginary\nmagnetic flux invalidates the bulk-boundary correspondence and leads to a\ntopological phase transition. However, the way of non-Hermiticity appearance\nmay alter the system topology. By alternatively introducing the non-Hermiticity\nunder symmetry to prevent nonzero imaginary magnetic flux, the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence recovers and every bulk state becomes extended; the bulk\ntopology of Bloch Hamiltonian predicts the (non)existence of edge states and\ntopological phase transition. These are elucidated in a non-Hermitian\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model, where chiral-inversion symmetry ensures the\nvanishing of imaginary magnetic flux. The average value of Pauli matrices under\nthe eigenstate of chiral-inversion symmetric Bloch Hamiltonian defines a vector\nfield, the vorticity of topological defects in the vector field is a\ntopological invariant.

This is in stark contrast to the prevalent term {\\em contextuality}\nused by many researchers in informal, heuristic yet omni-realistic and\npotentially misleading ways. This paper discusses both concepts and argues in\nfavor of value indefiniteness in all but a continuum of contexts intertwining\nin the vector representing a single pure (prepared) state. Even more\nrestrictively, and inspired by operationalism but not justified by Pitowsky's\nLogical Indeterminacy Principle or similar, one could identify with a \"quantum\nstate\" a single quantum context -- aka the respective maximal observable, or,\nin terms of its spectral decomposition, the associated orthonormal basis - from\nthe continuum of intertwining context, as per the associated maximal observable\nactually or implicitly measured. \n\n"}

Adding a single\nphoton shifts the resonance frequencies, a profound nonlinearity. cQED is a\ntest-bed of quantum optics and the basis of photon-photon and atom-atom\nentangling gates. At microwave frequencies, success in cQED has had a\ntransformative effect. At optical frequencies, the gates are potentially much\nfaster and the photons can propagate over long distances and be easily\ndetected, ideal features for quantum networks. Following pioneering work on\nsingle atoms, solid-state implementations are important for developing\npracticable quantum technology. Here, we embed a semiconductor quantum dot in a\nmicrocavity. The microcavity has a $\\mathcal{Q}$-factor close to $10^{6}$ and\ncontains a charge-tunable quantum dot with close-to-transform-limited optical\nlinewidth. The exciton-photon coupling rate $g$ exceeds both the photon decay\nrate $\\kappa$ and exciton decay rate $\\gamma$ by a large margin ($g/\\gamma=14$,\n$g/\\kappa=5.3$); the cooperativity is $C=2g^{2}/(\\gamma \\kappa)=150$, the\n$\\beta$-factor 99.7%. We observe pronounced vacuum Rabi oscillations in the\ntime-domain, photon blockade at a one-photon resonance, and highly bunched\nphoton statistics at a two-photon resonance.

This allows one to abstract the\ninformational content of a theory from the concrete details of its formalism.\nIn this framework, we extend the treatment of microcanonical thermodynamics,\nnamely the thermodynamics of systems with a well-defined energy, beyond the\nknown cases of classical and quantum theory, formulating two necessary\nrequirements for a well-defined thermodynamics. We adopt the recent approach of\nresource theories, where one studies the transitions between states that can be\naccomplished with a restricted set of physical operations. We formulate three\ndifferent resource theories, differing in the choice of the restricted set of\nphysical operations. To bridge the gap between the objective dynamics of\nparticles and the subjective world of probabilities, one of the core issues in\nthe foundations of statistical mechanics, we propose four information-theoretic\naxioms. They are satisfied by quantum theory and more exotic alternatives,\nincluding a suitable extension of classical theory where classical systems\ninteract with each other creating entangled states. The axioms identify a class\nof theories where every mixed state can be modelled as the reduced state of a\npure entangled state.

Indeed many theoretical studies have reported increased power\noutputs in dimer systems which use quantum interference to generate dark\nstates. These models have typically been restricted to particular geometries\nand to weakly coupled vibrational baths. Here we consider the\nexperimentally-relevant strong vibrational coupling regime with no geometric\nrestrictions on the dimer. We analyze how dark states can be formed in the\ndimer by numerically minimizing the emission rate of the lowest energy excited\neigenstate, and then calculate the power output of the molecules with these\ndark states. We find that there are two distinct types of dark states depending\non whether the monomers form homodimers, where energy splittings and dipole\nstrengths are identical, or heterodimers, where there is some difference.\nHomodimers, which exploit destructive quantum interference, produce high power\noutputs but strong phonon couplings and perturbations from ideal geometries are\nextremely detrimental. Heterodimers, which are closer to the classical picture\nof a distinct donor and acceptor molecule, produce an intermediate power output\nthat is relatively stable to these changes.

Developing\nSchroedinger's ideas in an information-theoretic context we suggest that a\nnatural understanding of quantum entanglement results when one accepts (1) that\nthe amount of information per elementary system is finite and (2) that the\ninformation in a composite system resides more in the correlations than in\nproperties of individuals.

First, they cannot be modelled by a classical stochastic process.\nSecond, they are contextual, namely they depend strongly on the specific\nmeasurement scheme through which they are determined. We construct\nPositive-Operator-Valued measures (POVM) that provide such probabilities. For\nobservables with continuous spectrum, the constructed POVMs depend strongly on\nthe resolution of the measurement device, a conclusion that persists even if we\nconsider a quantum mechanical measurement device or the presence of an\nenvironment. We then examine the same issues in alternative interpretations of\nquantum theory. We first show that multi-time probabilities cannot be naturally\ndefined in terms of a frequency operator. We next prove that local hidden\nvariable theories cannot reproduce the predictions of quantum theory for\nsequential measurements, even when the degrees of freedom of the measuring\napparatus are taken into account. Bohmian mechanics, however, does not fall in\nthis category. We finally examine an alternative proposal that sequential\nmeasurements can be modelled by a process that does not satisfy the Kolmogorov\naxioms of probability. This removes contextuality without introducing\nnon-locality, but implies that the empirical probabilities cannot be always\ndefined (the event frequencies do not converge).
