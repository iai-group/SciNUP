Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The\nDarwin-torque-based derivation, though, is general enough to accommodate both a\nfinite inclination and the actual rheology.\n  Although rheologies with Q scaling as the frequency to a positive power make\nthe torque diverge at a zero frequency, this reveals not the impossible nature\nof the rheology, but a flaw in mathematics, i.e., a common misassumption that\ndamping merely provides lags to the terms of the Fourier series for the tidal\npotential. A hydrodynamical treatment (Darwin 1879) had demonstrated that the\nmagnitudes of the terms, too, get changed. Reinstating of this detail tames the\ninfinities and rehabilitates the \"impossible\" scaling law (which happens to be\nthe actual law the terrestrial planets obey at low frequencies). \n\n"}

GRB 061126 was a long burst (T_90=191 s) with four\noverlapping peaks in its gamma-ray light curve. The X-ray afterglow, observed\nfrom 26 min to 20 days after the burst, shows a simple power-law decay with\nalpha_X=1.290 \\pm 0.008. Optical observations presented here cover the time\nrange from 258 s (Faulkes Telescope North) to 15 days (Gemini North) after the\nburst; the decay rate of the optical afterglow shows a steep-to-shallow\ntransition (from alpha_1=1.48 \\pm 0.06 to alpha_2=0.88 \\pm 0.03) approximately\n13 min after the burst. We suggest the early, steep component is due to a\nreverse shock and show that the magnetic energy density in the ejecta,\nexpressed as a fraction of the equipartion value, is a few ten times larger\nthan in the forward shock in the early afterglow phase. The ejecta might be\nendowed with primordial magnetic fields at the central engine. The optical\nlight curve implies a late-time break at about 1.5 days after the burst, while\nthere is no evidence of the simultaneous break in the X-ray light curve.

During\nthis process, the residual energy of each ionizing photon is deposited in the\nIGM as heat, increasing its temperature to 20,000-30,000 K; subsequent\nexpansion of the Universe then cools the gas. Because reionization most likely\nproceeds from high to low densities, underdense voids are ionized last, have\nless time to cool, and are (on average) warmer than mean-density gas\nimmediately after reionization is complete (an \"inverted\" equation of state).\n  From this initial configuration, the low-density gas cools quickly and\neventually returns to a more normal equation of state. The rapidly evolving\ntemperature introduces systematic uncertainties in measurements of the ionizing\nbackground at z~6. For example, late reionization implies rapid cooling, so\nthat the ionizing background would have to evolve even more rapidly at z ~5-6\nthan typically claimed.

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the semi-major\naxis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricity\ndistribution is determined after the disk dissipation. We also find that there\nmay be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution. Our\nsimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in\nmean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's\nperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed\nrate of MMRs.

Assuming that the initial BH seeds are relatively massive, of the\norder of 10^5 Msun, and that seeding occurs around z~15 in dark matter haloes\nof mass 10^9-10^10 Msun, we find that it is possible to build up supermassive\nBHs (SMBHs) by z=6 that assemble most of their mass during extended\nEddington-limited accretion periods. The properties of the simulated SMBHs are\nconsistent with observations of z=6 quasars in terms of the estimated BH masses\nand bolometric luminosities, the amount of star formation occurring within the\nhost halo, and the presence of highly enriched gas in the innermost regions of\nthe host galaxy.

Indeed, their inclusion is crucial since the sources in M31\nmicrolensing events are mainly giant stars. Light curves with detectable\nplanetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the\ncorresponding Paczy\\'{n}ski shapes. We find that the time scale of planetary\ndeviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source size\nincreases.

In this paper we use the different metallicity\ndependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate\nbetween these two processes. We study the effects of metallicity, Z, on the\ndispersal timescale, t_phot, in the context of a photoevaporation model, by\nmeans of detailed thermal calculations of a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium\nirradiated by EUV and X-ray radiation from the central source.

Abstract: In planetary nebulae, abundances of oxygen and other heavy elements derived\nfrom optical recombination lines are systematically higher than those derived\nfrom collisionally excited lines. We investigate the hypothesis that the\ndestruction of solid bodies may produce pockets of cool, high-metallicity gas\nthat could explain these abundance discrepancies. Under the assumption of\nmaximally efficient radiative ablation, we derive two fundamental constraints\nthat the solid bodies must satisfy in order that their evaporation during the\nplanetary nebula phase should generate a high enough gas phase metallicity. A\nlocal constraint implies that the bodies must be larger than tens of meters,\nwhile a global constraint implies that the total mass of the solid body\nreservoir must exceed a few hundredths of a solar mass. This mass greatly\nexceeds the mass of any population of comets or large debris particles expected\nto be found orbiting evolved low- to intermediate-mass stars. We therefore\nconclude that contemporaneous solid body destruction cannot explain the\nobserved abundance discrepancies in planetary nebulae. However, similar\narguments applied to the sublimation of solid bodies during the preceding\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase do not lead to such a clear-cut conclusion.\nIn this case, the required reservoir of volatile solids is only one\nten-thousandth of a solar mass, which is comparable to the most massive debris\ndisks observed around solar-type stars, implying that this mechanism may\ncontribute to abundance discrepancies in at least some planetary nebulae, so\nlong as mixing of the high metallicity gas is inefficient. \n\n"}

The V-K colours of RGB\nstars, obtained by combining the new data with existing optical observations,\nallow us to derive a distribution of global metallicity [M/H] with average\n[M/H] = -1.51 (uncorrected) or [M/H] = -1.24 +/- 0.05 (int) +/- 0.15 (syst)\nafter correction for the mean age of Leo I stars.

In this scenario,\nsurvival of giant planets formed by gravitational instability is predicted to\nbe more likely around low-metallicity stars, since they evolve to the point of\ncollapse to small size on shorter time scales. But metal-rich planets, as a\nresult of longer contraction times, have the best opportunity to capture\nplanetesimals and form heavy-element cores. Second, we investigate the effects\nof opacity reduction as a result of grain growth and settling, for the same\nthree planetary masses and for three different values of overall metallicity.\nWhen these processes are included, the pre-collapse time scale is found to be\nof order 1000 years for the three masses, significantly shorter than the time\nscale calculated without these effects.

We\nalso perform calculations of nucleosynthesis and LCs of several fallback SN\nmodel, and find that a fallback SN from the progenitor with a main-sequence\nmass of 13 Msun can account for the properties of the peculiar Type Ia\nsupernova SN 2008ha.

In such configuration, the system loses the axisymmetry\npresented in the aligned case, requiring a fully 3D approach. We perform 3D\nnumerical MHD simulations of stellar winds and study the effects caused by\ndifferent model parameters. The system reaches a periodic behavior with the\nsame rotational period of the star. We show that the magnetic field lines\npresent an oscillatory pattern and that by increasing the misalignment angle,\nthe wind velocity increases. Our wind models allow us to study the interaction\nof a magnetized wind with a magnetized extra-solar planet. Such interaction\ngives rise to reconnection, generating electrons that propagate along the\nplanet's magnetic field lines and produce electron cyclotron radiation at radio\nwavelengths. We find that a close-in Jupiter-like planet orbiting at 0.05AU\npresents a radio power that is ~5 orders of magnitude larger than the one\nobserved in Jupiter, which suggests that the stellar wind from a young star has\nthe potential to generate strong planetary radio emission that could be\ndetected in the near future with LOFAR.

Taken together with the high\nbrightness temperature of ~10^7 K for the core region, the radio emission\nappears to be coming from a synchrotron jet. At a position angle of 25 degrees,\nthe parsec-scale jet seems to be pointing closely toward the western edge of\nthe southern kpc-scale bubble in NGC 6764. A real connection between the\nparsec- and sub-kpc-scale emission would not only suggest the presence of a\ncurved jet, but also a close link between the AGN jet and the radio bubbles in\nNGC 6764. We demonstrate that a precessing jet model can explain the radio\nmorphology from parsec- to sub-kpc scales, and the model best-fit parameters of\njet speed and orientation are fully consistent with the observed\njet-to-counterjet surface brightness ratio.

Lyman transitions, in particular the\nLyman-alpha line, have long been recognized as one of the bottlenecks of\nrecombination, due to their very low escape probabilities. The Sobolev\napproximation does not describe radiative transfer in the vicinity of Lyman\nlines to a sufficient degree of accuracy, and several corrections have already\nbeen computed in other works. In this paper, the impact of some previously\nignored radiative transfer effects is calculated. First, the effect of Thomson\nscattering in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line is evaluated, using a full\nredistribution kernel incorporated into a radiative transfer code. The effect\nof feedback of distortions generated by the optically thick deuterium\nLyman-alpha line blueward of the hydrogen line is investigated with an analytic\napproximation.

The\nkey ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on\nrelatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or\nlarger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a\nconfiguration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to\nsubstantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral\ngrazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic\nencounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the\nphotosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary\nstar increasing its own radius. This is motivated by the case of $\\eta$\nCarinae, where such a collision must have occured if conventional estimates of\nthe present-day orbit are correct, and where brief peaks in the light curve\ncoincide with periastron. Stellar collisions may explain brief recurring LBV\noutbursts like SN 2000ch and SN 2009ip, and perhaps outbursts from relatively\nlow-mass progenitor stars (collisons are not necessarily the exclusive domain\nof very luminous stars).

However, most population synthesis models still\nrely on theoretical isochrones which do not include realistic modelling of\nextended HBs. In this work, we create detailed models for a range of old simple\nstellar populations (SSPs), to create a variety of realistic HB morphologies,\nfrom extended red clumps, to extreme blue HBs. We achieve this by utilising\nstellar tracks from the BaSTI database and implementing a different mass loss\nprescription for each SSP created, resulting in different HB morphologies. We\nfind that, for each metallicity, there is some HB morphology which maximises\nHbeta, making an underlying 14Gyr population look ~5-6Gyr old for the low and\nintermediate metallicity cases, and as young as 2Gyr for a solar metallicity\nSSP. We explore whether there are any spectral indices capable of breaking the\ndegeneracy between an old SSP with extended blue HB and a truly young or\nintermediate age SSP, and find that the CaII index of Rose(1984) and the\nstrength of the MgII doublet at 2800A are promising candidates, in combination\nwith Hbeta and other metallicity indicators such as Mgb and Fe5406. We also run\nMonte Carlo simulations to investigate the level of statistical fluctuations in\nthe spectra of typical stellar clusters.

In the literature, the reported error bars for Epeak are the simple\nPoisson statistical errors. Additional uncertainties arise due to the choices\nmade by analysts in determining Epeak (e.g., the start and stop times of\nintegration), imperfect knowledge of the response of the detector, different\nenergy ranges for various detectors, and differences in models used to fit the\nspectra. We examine the size of these individual sources of scatter by\ncomparing many independent pairs of published Epeak values for the same bursts.\nIndeed, the observed scatter in multiple reports of the same burst (often with\nthe same data) is greatly larger than the published statistical error bars. We\nmeasure that the one-sigma uncertainty associated with the analyst's choices is\n28%, i.e., 0.12 in Log10(Epeak), with the resultant errors always being\npresent.

Is any fit\n  acceptable? Abstract: The $^{15}{\\rm N}(p,\\gamma)^{16}{\\rm O}$ reaction provides a path from the CN\ncycle to the CNO bi-cycle and CNO tri-cycle. The measured astrophysical factor\nfor this reaction is dominated by resonant capture through two strong\n$J^{\\pi}=1^{-}$ resonances at $E_{R}= 312$ and 962 keV and direct capture to\nthe ground state. Recently, a new measurement of the astrophysical factor for\nthe $^{15}{\\rm N}(p,\\gamma)^{16}{\\rm O}$ reaction has been published [P. J.\nLeBlanc {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. {\\bf C 82}, 055804 (2010)]. The analysis has\nbeen done using the $R$-matrix approach with unconstrained variation of all\nparameters including the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC). The best\nfit has been obtained for the square of the ANC $C^{2}= 539.2$ fm${}^{-1}$,\nwhich exceeds the previously measured value by a factor of $\\approx 3$. Here we\npresent a new $R$-matrix analysis of the Notre Dame-LUNA data with the fixed\nwithin the experimental uncertainties square of the ANC $C^{2}=200.34$\nfm${}^{-1}$. Rather than varying the ANC we add the contribution from a\nbackground resonance that effectively takes into account contributions from\nhigher levels. Altogether we present 8 fits, five unconstrained and three\nconstrained. In all the fits the ANC is fixed at the previously determined\nexperimental value $C^{2}=200.34$ fm${}^{-1}$. For the unconstrained fit with\nthe boundary condition $B_{c}=S_{c}(E_{2})$, where $E_{2}$ is the energy of the\nsecond level, we get $S(0)=39.0 \\pm 1.1 $ keVb and normalized ${\\tilde\n\\chi}^{2}=1.84$, i.e. the result which is similar to [P.

Several maser\nspecies have been detected around IRS1. The CH3OH masers have been suggested to\ntrace a Keplerian-disk, while the H2O masers are almost aligned to the outflow.\nMore recent results suggested that the region hosts a torus and potentially a\ndisk, but with a different inclination than the Keplerian-disk that is supposed\nto be traced by the CH3OH masers. Tracing the magnetic field close to\nprotostars is fundamental for determining the orientation of the disk/torus.\nRecent studies showed that during the protostellar phase of high-mass star\nformation the magnetic field is oriented along the outflows and around or on\nthe surfaces of the disk/torus.

This has important\nramifications for the structure of the Oort Cloud, as it means that the solar\nsystem may have experienced tidal and stellar perturbations that were\nsignificantly different from its current local galactic environment. To\ncharacterize the effects of solar migration within the Milky Way, we use direct\nnumerical simulations to model the formation of an Oort Cloud around stars that\nend up on solar-type orbits in a galactic-scale simulation of a Milky Way-like\ndisk formation. Surprisingly, our simulations indicate that Sedna's orbit may\nbelong to the classical Oort Cloud. Contrary to previous understanding, we show\nthat field star encounters play a pivotal role in setting the Oort Cloud's\nextreme inner edge, and due to their stochastic nature this inner edge\nsometimes extends to Sedna's orbit. The Sun's galactic migration heightens the\nchance of powerful stellar passages, and Sedna production occurs around ~20-30%\nof the solar-like stars we study.

There is consensus that a white dwarf star explodes after accreting\nmatter in a binary system, but the secondary could be anything from a main\nsequence star to a red giant, or even another white dwarf.

We detect a\nwarm dust component in Kepler's remnant with T = 82K and mass 0.0031Msun; this\nis spatially coincident with thermal X-ray emission optical knots and\nfilaments, consistent with the warm dust originating in the circumstellar\nmaterial swept up by the primary blast wave of the remnant. Similarly for\nTycho's remnant, we detect warm dust at 90K with mass 0.0086Msun. Comparing the\nspatial distribution of the warm dust with X-rays from the ejecta and swept-up\nmedium, and Ha emission arising from the post-shock edge, we show that the warm\ndust is swept up interstellar material. We find no evidence of a cool (25-50 K)\ncomponent of dust with mass >0.07Msun as observed in core-collapse remnants of\nmassive stars. Neither the warm or cold dust components detected here are\nspatially coincident with supernova ejecta material.

Our technique\nutilizes colors from deep photometry in the I-band and in two medium-band\nfilters at lambda~753 and 770nm, which accurately measure the depth of a\nmolecular feature present in the spectra of cool stars. From these colors we\ncan derive effective temperatures with a precision corresponding to better than\none-half spectral subtype, and importantly this precision is independent of the\nextinction to the individual stars.

The interface modes are driven unstable by\nRayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz in- stabilities, but can be stabilized by\nthe toroidal field (through magnetic tension) and disc differential rotation\n(through finite vorticity).

As a result of this, the possibility of a\nnuclear physics solution to the 7Li problem is significantly suppressed.

Here, we study the evolution of\nwind-accretion disks, using a numerical approach which allows us to follow the\nlong term evolution. For a broad range of initial conditions, we derive the\nradial density and temperature profiles of the disk. In most cases,\nwind-accretion leads to long-lived stable disks over the lifetime of the AGB\ndonor star. The disks have masses of a few times 10^{-5}-10^{-3} M_sun, with\nsurface density and temperature profiles that follow broken power-laws.

These H II regions are discrete objects, but most multiwavelength models\nof starbursts assume a uniform medium of ionized gas, if they include the\nabsorption at all. I calculate the effective absorption coefficient of H II\nregions in starbursts, which is ultimately a cross section times the density of\nH II regions. The cross sections are calculated by assuming that H II regions\nare Str\\\"omgren spheres. The coefficient asymptotes to a constant value at low\nfrequencies, because H II regions partially cover the starburst, and are buried\npart way into the starburst's synchrotron emitting material.

Lithium is easily destroyed by proton capture in stellar\nenvironments, so its abundance may be crucial to discriminate among different\nmodels proposed to account for multiple populations. In order to reproduce the\nobserved O-Na anticorrelation and other patterns typical of multiple\npopulations, the formation of second generation stars must occur from the\nnuclearly processed stellar ejecta, responsible of the chemical anomalies,\ndiluted with pristine gas having the composition of first generation stars. The\nlithium abundance in the unprocessed gas -which is very likely to be equal to\nthe lithium abundance emerging from the Big Bang- affects the lithium chemical\npatterns among the cluster stars. This paper focuses on a scenario in which\nprocessed gas is provided by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We examine\nthe predictions of this scenario for the lithium abundances of multiple\npopulations. We study the role of the non-negligible lithium abundance in the\nejecta of massive AGB (A(Li)~2), and, at the same time, we explore how our\nmodels can constrain the extremely large ---and very model dependent--- lithium\nyields predicted by recent super--AGB models.

Post warm-up gas phase chemistry of CH4 released from the\ngrain at t\\sim 0.2 Myr and lasting for 1 Myr can explain the observed C3\nabundance in the envelope of DR21(OH) and no mechanism involving\nphotodestruction of PAH molecules is required. The chemistry in the envelope is\nsimilar to the warm carbon chain chemistry (WCCC) found in lukewarm corinos.\nThe observed lower C3 abundance in MM1 as compared to MM2 and the envelope\ncould be indicative of destruction of C3 in the more evolved MM1. The timescale\nfor the chemistry derived for the envelope is consistent with the dynamical\ntimescale of 2 Myr derived for DR21(OH) in other studies. \n\n"}

In contrast with previous\nstudies, which focussed mainly on bright primaries, our central galaxies span a\nwide range of stellar mass, 10^7.5 < M_*^pri/M_sun < 10^11, from dwarfs to\ncentral cluster galaxies. Our analysis confirms that the average number of\nsatellites around bright primaries, when expressed in terms of\nsatellite-to-primary stellar mass ratio (m_*^sat/M_*^pri), is a strong function\nof M_*^pri. On the other hand, satellite abundance is largely independent of\nprimary mass for dwarf primaries (M_*^pri<10^10 M_sun). These results are\nconsistent with galaxy formation models in the LCDM scenario. We find excellent\nagreement between SDSS data and semi-analytic mock galaxy catalogues\nconstructed from the Millennium-II Simulation. Satellite galaxies trace dark\nmatter substructure in LCDM, so satellite abundance reflects the dependence on\nhalo mass, M_200, of both substructure and galaxy stellar mass (M_*). Since\ndark matter substructure is almost scale-free, the dependence of satellite\nabundance on primary mass results solely from the well-defined characteristic\nmass in the galaxy mass-halo mass relation. On dwarf galaxy scales, where\nmodels predict a power-law scaling, M_* \\propto M_200^2.5, similarity is\npreserved and satellite abundance is independent of primary mass. For primaries\nbrighter than the characteristic mass of the M_*-M_200 relation, satellite\nabundance increases strongly with primary mass. Our results provide strong\nsupport for the steep, approximately power-law dependence of dwarf galaxy mass\non halo mass envisioned in LCDM galaxy formation models. \n\n"}

Detection of the Galactic haze with\n  Planck Abstract: Using precise full-sky observations from Planck, and applying several methods\nof component separation, we identify and characterize the emission from the\nGalactic \"haze\" at microwave wavelengths. The haze is a distinct component of\ndiffuse Galactic emission, roughly centered on the Galactic centre, and extends\nto |b| ~35 deg in Galactic latitude and |l| ~15 deg in longitude. By combining\nthe Planck data with observations from the WMAP we are able to determine the\nspectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematic\nbiases present in previous analyses. The derived spectrum is consistent with\npower-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excluding\nfree-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrum\nsynchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (number\ndensity per energy) dN/dE ~ E^-2.1.

The fragmentation of self-gravitating\nprotostellar discs into gravitationally bound embryos - with masses of a few to\ntens of Jupiter masses, at semi major axes above 30 - 40 au - is followed by\ngrain sedimentation inside the embryo, radial migration towards the central\nstar and tidal disruption of the embryo's upper layers. The properties of the\nresultant object depends sensitively on the timescales upon which each process\noccurs. Therefore, GI followed by tidal downsizing can theoretically produce\nobjects spanning a large mass range, from terrestrial planets to giant planets\nand brown dwarfs. Whether such objects can be formed in practice, and what\nproportions of the observed population they would represent, requires a more\ninvolved statistical analysis.\n  We present a simple population synthesis model of star and planet formation\nvia GI and tidal downsizing.

First, in\nestimating the parameters of some model for the data, the posterior\ndistribution may well be highly multi-modal: a regime in which the convergence\nto stationarity of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques\nbecomes incredibly slow. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models\nthe necessary estimation of the Bayesian evidence for each is, by definition, a\n(possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space; again\nthis can be a daunting computational task, although new Monte Carlo (MC)\nintegration algorithms offer solutions of ever increasing efficiency. Nested\nsampling (NS) is one such contemporary MC strategy targeted at calculation of\nthe Bayesian evidence, but which also enables posterior inference as a\nby-product, thereby allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and model\nselection. The widely-used MultiNest algorithm presents a particularly\nefficient implementation of the NS technique for multi-modal posteriors. In\nthis paper we discuss importance nested sampling (INS), an alternative\nsummation of the MultiNest draws, which can calculate the Bayesian evidence at\nup to an order of magnitude higher accuracy than `vanilla' NS with no change in\nthe way MultiNest explores the parameter space.

In such cases, we show that the two limb\ndarkening coefficients are constrained by three physical boundary conditions,\ndescribing a triangular region in the two-dimensional parameter space. We show\nthat uniformly distributed samples may be drawn from this region with optimal\nefficiency by a technique developed by computer graphical programming:\ntriangular sampling. Alternatively, one can make draws using a uniform,\nbivariate Dirichlet distribution. We provide simple expressions for these\nparametrizations for both techniques applied to the case of quadratic,\nsquare-root and logarithmic limb darkening laws.

In this scenario the MWA can be\nconsidered the receiving element in a bi-static radar configuration, with FM\nbroadcast stations serving as non-cooperative transmitters. The FM broadcasts\npropagate into space, are reflected off debris in Earth orbit, and are received\nat the MWA.

For 4 sources infall takes place on core to envelope scales (i.e.\n~10000-3000 AU). In 2 sources the inverse P-Cygni profiles seen in the\nground-state lines are more likely due to larger-scale motions or foreground\nclouds.

The data are well fit by this\nexomoon model, but an alternate star+planet model fits the data almost as well.\nNevertheless, these results indicate the potential of microlensing to detect\nexomoons, albeit ones that are different from the giant planet moons in our\nsolar system. The argument for an exomoon hinges on the system being relatively\nclose to the Sun. The data constrain the product M pi_rel, where M is the lens\nsystem mass and pi_rel is the lens-source relative parallax. If the lens system\nis nearby (large pi_rel), then M is small (a few Jupiter masses) and the\ncompanion is a sub-Earth-mass exomoon.

HD 114613b has an orbital period\nP=10.5 years, and a minimum mass m sin i of 0.48 Jupiter masses; HD 154857c has\nP=9.5 years and m sin i=2.6 Jupiter masses. These new data confirm the\nplanetary nature of the previously unconstrained long-period object in the HD\n154857 system. We have performed detailed dynamical stability simulations which\nshow that the HD 154857 two-planet system is stable on timescales of at least\n100 million years. These results highlight the continued importance of \"legacy\"\nsurveys with long observational baselines; these ongoing campaigns are critical\nfor determining the population of Jupiter analogs, and hence of those planetary\nsystems with architectures most like our own Solar system. \n\n"}

Typically, a dozen or more of these bursts\noccur in a thirty day period.

This paper focuses on the\nmorphology of the outer disk through ALMA observations of $^{12}$CO J=2-1,\n$^{12}$CO J=3-2 and $^{13}$CO J=2-1. Both $^{12}$CO J=2-1 and $^{12}$CO J=3-2\nshow spiral features of different sizes. The innermost spiral arm (S1) is a\nradio counterpart of the first near-infrared spiral observed by Fukagawa et al.\n(2006), but it is shifted radially outward. However, the most conspicuous CO\nspiral arm (S2) lies at the outskirts of the disk and had not been detected\nbefore. It corresponds to a cold density structure, with both brightness and\nexcitation temperatures of order 13$\\pm$2 K and conspicuous in the $^{12}$CO\nJ=2-1 peak-intensity map, but faint in $^{12}$CO J=3-2.

They are compared with the properties of\nbarlenses, defined as lens-like structures embedded in bars, with sizes of\nabout 50% of bars and axial ratios of 0.6-0.9.

We find that the object exhibits two distinct modes of\nemission; a strong mode with a broad profile and a weak mode with a narrow\nprofile. During the strong mode of emission, the pulsar typically radiates very\nenergetic emission over sequences of ~200-6000 pulses (~60 s-24 min), with\napparent nulls over time-scales of up to a few pulses at a time. Emission\nduring the weak mode is observed outside of these strong-mode sequences and\nmanifests as occasional bursts of up to a few clearly detectable pulses at a\ntime, as well as low-level underlying emission which is only detected through\nprofile integration. This implies that the previously described null mode may\nin fact be representative of the bottom-end of the pulse intensity distribution\nfor the source. This is supported by the dramatic pulse-to-pulse intensity\nmodulation and rarity of exceptionally bright pulses observed during both modes\nof emission. Coupled with the fact that the source could be interpreted as a\nrotating radio transient (RRAT)-like object for the vast majority of the time,\nif placed at a further distance, we advance that this object likely represents\na bridge between RRATs and extreme moding pulsars. Further to these emission\nproperties, we also show that the source is consistent with being a\nnear-aligned rotator and that it does not exhibit any measurable spin-down rate\nvariation. These results suggest that nulls observed in other intermittent\nobjects may in fact be representative of very weak emission without the need\nfor complete cessation. As such, we argue that longer (> 1 h) observations of\npulsars are required to discern their true modulation properties. \n\n"}

Though\ncounterintuitive, this assertion follows directly from stellar tidal\ninteraction theory and the evolution of lower mass stars. There is strong\nevidence that chromospheric activity of rapidly rotating young stars may be\nhigh enough to cause mass loss from atmospheres of potentially habitable\nplanets. The removal of atmospheric water is most critical. Tidal breaking in\nbinaries could help reduce magnetic dynamo action and thereby chromospheric\nactivity in favor of life. We call this the Binary Habitability Mechanism\n(BHM), that we suggest allows for water retention at levels comparable to or\nbetter than Earth. We discuss novel advantages that life may exploit, in these\ncases, and suggest that life may even thrive on some circumbinary planets. We\nfind that while many binaries do not benefit from BHM, high quality niches do\nexist for various combinations of stars between 0.55 and 1.0 solar masses. For\na given pair of stellar masses, BHM operates only for certain combinations of\nperiod and eccentricity. Binaries having a solar-type primary seem to be quite\nwell suited niches having wide and distant habitable zones with plentiful water\nand sufficient light for photosynthetic life. We speculate that, as a direct\nresult of BHM, conditions may be suitable for life on several planets and\npossibly even moons of giant planets orbiting some binaries.

In actively star-forming\ngalaxies, the progression of the star formation rate is shallower than a\n$t^{-1}$ SN Ia DTD, so mean SN Ia ages peak at the DTD peak in all star-forming\ngalaxies at all epochs of cosmic history. In passive galaxies which have ceased\nstar formation through some quenching process, the SN Ia age distribution peaks\nat the quenching epoch, which in passive galaxies evolves in redshift to track\nthe past epoch of major star formation. Our models reproduce the SN Ia rate\nevolution in redshift, the relationship between SN Ia stretch and host mass,\nand the distribution of SN Ia host masses in a manner qualitatively consistent\nwith observations. Our model naturally predicts that low-mass galaxies tend to\nbe actively star-forming while massive galaxies are generally passive,\nconsistent with observations of galaxy \"downsizing\". Consequently, the mean\nages of SNe Ia undergo a sharp transition from young ages at low host mass to\nold ages at high host mass, qualitatively similar to the transition of mean SN\nIa Hubble residuals with host mass.

These are not restricted to our particular dataset, but are generally\napplicable to different kinds of X-shooter data without major limitation on the\nastronomical object of interest. ESO's X-shooter pipeline (v1.5.0) performs\nwell and reliably for the wavelength calibration and the associated\nrectification procedure, yet we find several weaknesses in the reduction\ncascade that are addressed with additional calibration steps, such as bad pixel\ninterpolation, flat fielding, and slit illumination corrections. Furthermore,\nthe instrumental PSF is analytically modeled and used to reconstruct flux\nlosses at slit transit and for optimally extracting point sources. Regular\nobservations of spectrophotometric standard stars allow us to detect\ninstrumental variability, which needs to be understood if a reliable absolute\nflux calibration is desired. A cascade of additional custom calibration steps\nis presented that allows for an absolute flux calibration uncertainty of less\nthan ten percent under virtually every observational setup provided that the\nsignal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently high.

In this\npaper we are trying to solve the problem in the regime of solid quark-cluster\nstars. Inside quark-cluster stars, the extremely low ratio of number density of\nelectrons to that of baryons $n_e/n_b$ and the screening effect from\nquark-clusters could reduce the long-range Coulomb interaction between\nelectrons to short-range interaction. In this case, the Stoner's model could\napply, and we find that the condition for ferromagnetism is consistent with\nthat for validity of Stoner's model.

There is an extra increase in\nradius of planets if $l_-$ is higher than 1100 times energy received by the\nEarth ($l_\\oplus$). This is likely due to dissociation of molecules.

The radial extension of such disks is unknown,\npartly because we lack information about the radial variations of the\nviscosity. We study the magnetorotational instability, which is considered to\nbe the origin of anomalous viscosity in outflowing disks. We used analytic\ncalculations to study the stability of outflowing disks submerged in the\nmagnetic field. The magnetorotational instability develops close to the star if\nthe plasma parameter is large enough. At large radii the instability disappears\nin the region where the disk orbital velocity is roughly equal to the sound\nspeed. The magnetorotational instability is a plausible source of anomalous\nviscosity in outflowing disks. This is also true in the region where the disk\nradial velocity approaches the sound speed.

{"id": "1411.6789", "contents": "Title: Polytropic dark matter flows illuminate dark energy and accelerated\n  expansion Abstract: Currently, a large amount of data implies that the matter constituents of the\ncosmological dark sector might be collisional. An attractive feature of such a\npossibility is that, it can reconcile dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) in\nterms of a single component, accommodated in the context of a polytropic-DM\nfluid. Accordingly, we explore the time evolution and the dynamical\ncharacteristics of a spatially-flat cosmological model, in which, in principle,\nthere is no DE at all. Instead, in this model, the DM itself possesses some\nsort of fluid-like properties, i.e., the fundamental units of the Universe\nmatter-energy content are the volume elements of a DM fluid, performing\npolytropic flows. In this case, the energy of this fluid's internal motions is\nalso taken into account as a source of the universal gravitational field. This\nform of energy can compensate for the extra energy needed to compromise spatial\nflatness, namely, to justify that, today, the total-energy density parameter is\nexactly unity. The polytropic cosmological model, depends on only one free\nparameter, the corresponding exponent, \\Gamma. What makes this model\nparticularly interesting, is that, for \\Gamma < 0.541, the (conventional)\npressure becomes negative enough, so that the Universe accelerates its\nexpansion at cosmological redshifts below a transition value. Several physical\nreasons impose further constraints on the value of \\Gamma, which, eventually,\nis settled down to the range -0.089 < \\Gamma < 0. Such a cosmological model\ndoes not suffer either from the age problem or from the coincidence problem. At\nthe same time, this model reproduces to high accuracy the distance measurements\nperformed with the aid of the supernovae Type Ia standard candles, and most\nnaturally interprets, not only when, but also, why the Universe transits from\ndeceleration to acceleration, thus arising as a mighty contestant for a DE\nmodel. \n\n"}

This standard classification has recently been\nchallenged by the {\\em Swift} discovery of short GRBs showing Extended Emission\n(SGRBEE) and nearby long GRBs without an accompanying supernova (LGRBN). Both\nshow an initial hard pulse, characteristic of SGRBs, followed by a long\nduration soft tail. We here consider the spectral peak energy\n($E_{p,i}$)-radiated energy $(E_{iso})$ correlation and the redshift\ndistributions to probe the astronomical and physical origin of these different\nclasses of GRBs. We consider {\\em Swift} events of $15$ SGRBs, $7$ SGRBEEs, 3\nLGRBNs and 230 LGRBs. The spectral-energy properties of the initial pulse of\nboth SGRBEE and LGRBNs are found to coincide with those of SGRBs. A Monte Carlo\nsimulation shows that the redshift distributions of SGRBs, SGRBEE and LGRBNs\nfall outside the distribution of LGRBs at 4.75$\\,\\sigma$, 4.67$\\,\\sigma$ and\n4.31$\\sigma$, respectively. A distinct origin of SGRBEEs with respect to LGRBs\nis also supported by the elliptical host galaxies of the SGRBEE events 050509B\nand 050724. This combined evidence supports the hypothesis that SGRBEE and\nLGRBNs originate in mergers as SGRBs. Moreover, long/soft tail of SGRB and\nLGRBNs satisfy the same $E_{p,i}-E_{iso}$ Amati-correlation holding for normal\nLGRBs. This fact points to rapidly rotating black holes as a common long-lived\ninner engine produced by different astronomical progenitors (mergers and\nsupernovae). \n\n"}

The parameterization is performed from a\ncomparison of 3D CO5BOLD simulations with a grid of 1D envelopes with a varying\nmixing-length parameter. In many instances, the 3D simulations are restricted\nto the upper part of the convection zone. The hydrodynamical calculations\nsuggest, in those cases, that the entropy of the upflows does not change\nsignificantly from the bottom of the convection zone to regions immediately\nbelow the photosphere. We rely on this asymptotic entropy value, characteristic\nof the deep and adiabatically stratified layers, to calibrate 1D envelopes. The\ncalibration encompasses the convective hydrogen-line (DA) white dwarfs in the\neffective temperature range 6000 < Teff (K) < 15,000 and the surface gravity\nrange 7.0 < log g < 9.0. It is established that the local MLT is unable to\nreproduce simultaneously the thermodynamical, flux, and dynamical properties of\nthe 3D simulations. We therefore propose three different parameterizations for\nthese quantities. The resulting calibration can be applied to structure and\nenvelope calculations, in particular for pulsation, chemical diffusion, and\nconvective mixing studies. On the other hand, convection has no effect on the\nwhite dwarf cooling rates until there is a convective coupling with the\ndegenerate core below Teff ~ 5000 K. In this regime, the 1D structures are\ninsensitive to the MLT parameterization and converge to the mean 3D results,\nhence remain fully appropriate for age determinations. \n\n"}

Poznanski (2013) has recently\nsuggested an observational correlation between the ejecta velocities and the\ninferred masses of the red supergiant progenitors of type II-P explosions,\nwhich implies that the kinetic energy of the ejecta ($E_{\\textrm{kin}}$)\nincreases with the mass of the progenitor. I point out that the same conclusion\ncan be reached from the model-free observed correlation between the ejected\n$^{56}$Ni masses ($M_{\\textrm{Ni}}$) and the luminosities of the progenitors\nfor type II supernovae, which was reported by Fraser et al. (2011). This\ncorrelation is in an agreement with the predictions of the collapse-induced\nthermonuclear explosions (CITE) for CCSNe and in a possible contradiction with\nthe predictions of the neutrino mechanism. I show that a correlation between\n$M_{\\textrm{Ni}}$ and $E_{\\textrm{kin}}$ holds for all types of CCSNe\n(including type Ibc). This correlation suggests a common mechanism for all\nCCSNe, which is predicted for CITE, but is not produced by current simulations\nof the neutrino mechanism. Furthermore, the typical values of\n$E_{\\textrm{kin}}$ and $M_{\\textrm{Ni}}$ for type Ibc explosions are larger by\nan order of a magnitude than the typical values for II-P explosions, a fact\nwhich disfavors progenitors with the same initial mass range for these\nexplosions. Instead, the progenitors of type Ibc explosions could be massive\nWolf-Rayet stars, which are predicted to yield strong explosions with low\nejecta masses (as observed) according to CITE. In this case, there is no\ndeficit of high mass progenitors for CCSNe, which was suggested under the\nassumption of a similar mass range for the progenitors of types II-P and Ibc\nsupernovae. \n\n"}

We examine the impact of\nthe uncertainties of the two neutron sources operating in low-mass asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) stars: the 13C(alpha, n)16O reaction, which releases\nneutrons radiatively during interpulse periods (kT ~ 8 keV), and the\n22Ne(alpha, n)25Mg reaction, partially activated during the convective thermal\npulses (TPs).

In this case, we find that the present\nuncertainty associated to the 13C(alpha, n)16O reaction has marginal effects on\ns-only nuclei.

We find that the instability also appears for a\nmonotonically decreasing electron number density and magnetic field, a\nplane-parallel analogue of an azimuthal or meridional magnetic field in the\ncrust of a magnetar. The growth rate of the instability depends on the Hall\nproperties of the field (magnetic field intensity, electron number density and\nthe corresponding scale-heights), while being insensitive to weak resistivity.\nSince the Hall effect is the driving process for the evolution of the crustal\nmagnetic field of magnetars, we argue that this instability is critical for\nsystems containing strong meridional or azimuthal fields.

This correlation function is related to a `wake function', which is\nthe linear response of the system to the perturbation of a chosen Ring. The\nwake function is easier to appreciate, and satisfies a simpler equation, than\nthe correlation function. We discuss general implications for the interplay of\nsecular dynamics and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in the evolution of\nKeplerian stellar systems toward secular thermodynamic equilibria, and set the\nstage for applications to the RR of axisymmetric discs in Paper III. \n\n"}

Sub-filaments and\n  velocities Abstract: We show that hydrodynamic turbulent cloud simulations naturally produce large\nfilaments made up of a network of smaller and coherent sub-filaments. Such\nsimulations resemble observations of filaments and fibres in nearby molecular\nclouds. The sub-filaments are dynamical features formed at the stagnation\npoints of the turbulent velocity field where shocks dissipate the turbulent\nenergy. They are a ubiquitous feature of the simulated clouds, which appear\nfrom the beginning of the simulation and are not formed by gradual\nfragmentation of larger filaments. Most of the sub-filaments are\ngravitationally sub-critical and do not fragment into cores, however, there is\nalso a significant fraction of supercritical sub-filaments which break up into\nstar-forming cores. The sub-filaments are coherent along their length, and the\nresidual velocities along their spine show that they are subsonically\ncontracting without any ordered rotation on scales of ~0.1 pc. Accretion flows\nalong the sub-filaments can feed material into star forming cores embedded\nwithin the network. The overall mass in sub-filaments and the number of\nsub-filaments increases as the cloud evolves. We propose that the formation of\nfilaments and sub-filaments is a natural consequence of the turbulent cascade\nin the complex multi-phase interstellar medium. Sub-filaments are formed by the\nhigh wavenumber, small scale modes in the turbulent velocity field. These are\nthen stretched by local shear motions and gathered together by a combination of\nlow wavenumber modes and gravitational contraction on larger scales, and by\ndoing so build up the extended filaments observed in column density maps. \n\n"}

Most studies of the particle diffusion presuppose a scale\nseparation between the mean and random magnetic fields (e.g., there being a\npronounced minimum in the magnetic power spectrum at intermediate scales).\nScale separation is often a good approximation in laboratory plasmas, but not\nin most astrophysical environments such as the interstellar medium (ISM).\nModern simulations of the ISM have numerical resolution of order 1 pc, so the\nLarmor radius of the cosmic rays that dominate in energy density is at least\n$10^{6}$ times smaller than the resolved scales. Large-scale simulations of\ncosmic ray propagation in the ISM thus rely on oversimplified forms of the\ndiffusion tensor. We take the first steps towards a more realistic description\nof cosmic ray diffusion for such simulations, obtaining direct estimates of the\ndiffusion tensor from test particle simulations in random magnetic fields (with\nthe Larmor radius scale being fully resolved), for a range of particle energies\ncorresponding to $10^{-2}\\lesssim R_L/l_c \\lesssim 10^{3}$, where $l_c$ is the\nmagnetic correlation length.

The jets that are launched by the accreting NS or black\nhole (BH) maintain their axis due to a rapidly rotating pre-collapse core, and\ndo not manage to eject core material from near the equatorial plane. The jets\nare able to eject material from the core along the polar directions, and reduce\nthe gravity near the equatorial plane. The equatorial gas expands, and part of\nit falls back over a timescale of minutes to days to prolong the jets-launching\nepisode. According to the model for SESNe proposed in the present paper, the\nprincipal parameter that distinguishes between the different cases of CCSN\nexplosions, such as between normal CCSNe and SESNe, is the efficiency of the\njet-feedback mechanism. This efficiency in turn depends on the pre-collapse\ncore mass, envelope mass, core convection, and most of all on the angular\nmomentum profile in the core. One prediction of the inefficient jet-feedback\nmechanism for SESNe is the formation of a slow equatorial outflow in the\nexplosion.

This setup enables long-term\nobservation of the Sun as a star with state-of-the-art sensitivity to radial\nvelocity changes. Over seven days of observing in 2014, we show an average\n50\\cms radial velocity rms over a few hours of observation. After correcting\nobserved radial velocities for spot and plage perturbations using full-disk\nphotometry of the Sun, we lower by a factor of two the weekly radial velocity\nrms to 60\\cms. The solar telescope is now entering routine operation, and will\nobserve the Sun every clear day for several hours. We will use these radial\nvelocities combined with data from solar satellites to improve our\nunderstanding of stellar noise and develop optimal correction methods. If\nsuccessful, these new methods should enable the detection of Venus over the\nnext two to three years, thus demonstrating the possibility of detecting\nEarth-twins around other solar-like stars using the radial velocity technique. \n\n"}

These differing\ntorques reshape the angular momentum and energy distribution of stars in the\nstream, which in turn changes the growth rate of the stream. For a progenitor\norbiting in the same sense as the bar's rotation and satisfying a resonance\ncondition, the resultant stream can be substantially shorter or longer than\nexpected, depending on whether the pericentric passages of the progenitor occur\nalong the bar's minor or major axis respectively.

We use two-dimensional,\nradiation-hydrodynamics simulations of wind bubbles within HII regions around\nindividual stars to predict the infrared emission properties of the dust within\nthe HII region. We assume that dust and gas are dynamically well-coupled and\nthat dust properties (composition, size distribution) are the same in the HII\nregion as outside it, and that the wind bubble contains no dust. We\npost-process the simulations to make synthetic intensity maps at infrared\nwavebands using the TORUS code.

This produces a bright arc of emission\nfor slowly moving stars that have asymmetric wind bubbles, even for cases where\nthere is no bow shock or any corresponding feature in tracers of gas emission.\nThe 24um intensity decreases exponentially from the arc with increasing\ndistance from the star because the dust temperature decreases with distance.\nThe size distribution and composition of the dust grains has quantitative but\nnot qualitative effects on our results.

The most\npromising candidate, 2MASS J18082002-5104378 (V=11.9), was observed at high\nresolution (R=50 000) with UVES at the VLT/ESO, and a standard abundance\nanalysis was performed. Results. We found that 2MASS J18082002-5104378 is an\nultra metal-poor star with stellar parameters Teff = 5440 K, log g = 3.0 dex,\nvt = 1.5 km/s, [Fe/H] = -4.1 dex. The star has [C/Fe]<+0.9 in a 1D analysis, or\n[C/Fe]<=+0.5 if 3D effects are considered; its abundance pattern is typical of\nnormal (non-CEMP) ultra metal-poor stars. Interestingly, the star has a binary\ncompanion. Conclusions. 2MASS J1808-5104 is the brightest (V=11.9) metal-poor\nstar of its category, and it could be studied further with even higher S/N\nspectroscopy to determine additional chemical abundances, thus providing\nimportant constraints to the early chemical evolution of our Galaxy. \n\n"}

The ability to predict the presence of clouds/hazes a priori is an\nimportant goal when faced with limited telescope resources and advancements in\natmospheric characterization that rely on the detection of spectroscopic\nfeatures. As a means to identify favorable targets for future studies with HST\nand JWST, we use published HST/WFC3 transmission spectra to determine the\nstrength of each planet's water feature, as defined by the H2O - J index. By\nexpressing this parameter in units of atmospheric scale height, we provide a\nmeans to efficiently compare the size of spectral features over a physically\ndiverse sample of exoplanets.

The lack of hydrogen\nand He I emission lines in the spectrum implies that the companion is likely\nnot a main sequence star.

Such black-hole mergers have been predicted in two main types of\nformation models, involving isolated binaries in galactic fields or dynamical\ninteractions in young and old dense stellar environments. The measured masses\nrobustly demonstrate that relatively \"heavy\" black holes ($\\gtrsim 25\\,\nM_\\odot$) can form in nature.

The\ncentral star grows by accretion from the disk, and irradiation by the central\nstar heats up the disk and generates thermal wind, which results in the disk\ndispersal. We calculate the evolution of protoplanetary disks from their parent\npre-stellar cores to dispersal of the disks. We find that the disk lifetimes of\ntypical pre-stellar cores are around 2--4 million years (Myr). A pre-stellar\ncore with high angular momentum forms a larger disk whose lifetime is long,\nwhile a disk around a X-ray luminous star has a short lifetime.

Using detailed simulations of the nominal campaign\n(ignoring the loss of events due to Kepler's emergency mode) and ground-based\nmicrolensing surveys, we predict the number of events that can be detected if\nthere is a population of 1-Jupiter-mass FFPs matching current observational\nconstraints. Using a Fisher matrix analysis we also estimate the number of\ndetections for which it will be possible to measure the microlensing parallax,\nangular Einstein radius and FFP mass. We predict that between 1.4 and 7.9\nevents will be detected in the K2 data, depending on the noise floor that can\nbe reached, but with the optimistic scenario being more likely. For nearly all\nof these it will be possible to either measure the parallax or constrain it to\nbe probabilistically consistent with only planetary-mass lenses.

Progressing further in dark matter physics requires being able\nto understand structure formation in the non-linear regime, both for CDM and\nits alternatives. This short note describes a calculation, and accompanying\ncode, WarmAndFuzzy, incorporating the popular models of warm and fuzzy dark\nmatter (WDM and FDM) into the standard halo model to compute the non-linear\nmatter power spectrum. The FDM halo model power spectrum has not been computed\nbefore. The FDM implementation models ultralight axions and other scalar fields\nwith $m_a\\approx 10^{-22}\\text{ eV}$. The WDM implementation models thermal WDM\nwith mass $m_X\\approx 1\\text{ keV}$. The halo model shows that differences\nbetween WDM, FDM, and CDM survive at low redshifts in the quasi-linear and\nfully non-linear regimes. The code uses analytic transfer functions for the\nlinear power spectrum, modified collapse barriers in the halo mass function,\nand a modified concentration-mass relationship for the halo density profiles.\nModified halo density profiles (for example, cores) are not included, but are\nunder development.

There are, among others, a number of multiple\nplanetary systems in our sample as well as several planetary candidates in\nstellar binaries. Aims: We aim at detecting and characterizing\nsubstellar+stellar companions to the giant star HD 59686 A (HR 2877, HIP\n36616). Methods: We obtained high precision radial velocity (RV) measurements\nof the star HD 59686 A. By fitting a Keplerian model to the periodic changes in\nthe RVs, we can assess the nature of companions in the system. In order to\ndiscriminate between RV variations due to non-radial pulsation or stellar spots\nwe used infrared RVs taken with the CRIRES spectrograph at the Very Large\nTelescope.

In addition to the radar data from 2000\nET70's apparition in 2012, our model incorporates optical lightcurves and\ninfrared spectra that were not included in the analysis of Naidu et al.

We confirm the general \"clenched fist\" appearance of the\nNaidu et al. model, but compared to their model, our best-fit model is about\n10% longer along its long principal axis, nearly identical along the\nintermediate axis, and about 25% shorter along the short axis. We find the\nasteroid's dimensions to be 2.9 km $\\times$ 2.2 km $\\times$ 1.5 km (with\nrelative uncertainties of about 10%, 15%, and 25%, respectively).

The radar and lightcurve data together constrain the pole direction to\nfall along an arc that is about twenty-three degrees long and eight degrees\nwide. Infrared spectra from the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF) provide\nan additional constraint on the pole. Thermophysical modeling, using our\nSHERMAN software, shows that only a subset of the pole directions, about twelve\ndegrees of that arc, are compatible with the infrared data.

The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution. Assuming that early stellar\ndiscs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random\nmotions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density\ndistributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars.

However, no simple way to estimate the potential\nprecision of such timing measures has been presented yet, nor are guidelines\navailable regarding the relation between timing errors and sampling rate.\n  Aims: A `timing error estimator' (TEE) equation is presented that requires\nonly basic transit parameters as input. With the TEE, it is straightforward to\nestimate timing precisions both for actual data as well as for future\ninstruments, such as the TESS and PLATO space missions.\n  Methods: A derivation of the timing error based on a trapezoidal transit\nshape is given. We also verify the TEE on realistically modeled transits using\nMonte Carlo simulations and determine its validity range, exploring in\nparticular the interplay between ingress/egress times and sampling rates.\n  Results: The simulations show that the TEE gives timing errors very close to\nthe correct value, as long as the temporal sampling is faster than transit\ningress/egress durations and transits with very low S/N are avoided.\n  Conclusions: The TEE is a useful tool to estimate eclipse or transit timing\nerrors in actual and future data-sets. In combination with an equation to\nestimate period errors (Deeg 2015), predictions for the ephemeris precision of\nlong-coverage observations are possible as well. The tests for the TEE's\nvalidity-range led also to implications for instrumental design: Temporal\nsampling has to be faster than transit in- or egress durations, or a loss in\ntiming-precision will occur. An application to the TESS mission shows that\ntransits close to its detection limit will have timing uncertainties that\nexceed 1 hour within a few months after their acquisition. Prompt follow-up\nobservations will be needed to avoid a `loosing' of their ephemeris. \n\n"}

The goals consisted of studying its atmospheric\ndynamics (Simon et al. 2016), detecting its global acoustic oscillations (Rowe\net al., submitted), and those of the Sun, which we report on here. We present\nthe first indirect detection of solar oscillations in intensity measurements.\nBeyond the remarkable technical performance, it indicates how Kepler would see\na star like the Sun. The result from the global asteroseismic approach, which\nconsists of measuring the oscillation frequency at maximum amplitude \"nu_max\"\nand the mean frequency separation between mode overtones \"Delta nu\", is\nsurprising as the nu_max measured from Neptune photometry is larger than the\naccepted value. Compared to the usual reference nu_max_sun = 3100 muHz, the\nasteroseismic scaling relations therefore make the solar mass and radius appear\nlarger by 13.8 +/- 5.8 % and 4.3 +/- 1.9 % respectively. The higher nu_max is\ncaused by a combination of the value of nu_max_sun, being larger at the time of\nobservations than the usual reference from SOHO/VIRGO/SPM data (3160 +/- 10\nmuHz), and the noise level of the K2 time series, being ten times larger than\nVIRGO's.

We focus on the regime where the local thermal\ntimescale is shorter than the dynamical timescale, corresponding to inefficient\nconvective energy transport. We begin with initially weak magnetic fields\nrelative to the thermal pressure, from 100-1000G in differing geometries. The\nunstable density inversion amplifies the magnetic field, increasing the\nmagnetic energy density to values close to equipartition with the turbulent\nkinetic energy density. By providing pressure support, the magnetic field's\npresence significantly increases the density fluctuations in the turbulent\nenvelope, thereby enhancing the radiative energy transport by allowing photons\nto diffuse out through low density regions. Magnetic buoyancy brings small\nscale magnetic fields to the photosphere and increases the vertical energy\ntransport with the energy advection velocity proportional to the Alfv\\'en\nvelocity, although in all cases we study photon diffusion still dominates the\nenergy transport. The increased radiative and advective energy transport causes\nthe stellar envelope to shrink by several scale heights.

The photosphere also\nshows vertical oscillations with similar averaged velocities and periods of a\nfew hours.

We pay\nattention to effects of BH mass function on the total mass and mass ratio\ndistributions of BH binaries ejected from clusters. Firstly, we consider BH\npopulations with two different masses in order to learn basic differences from\nmodels with single-mass BHs only. Secondly, we consider continuous BH mass\nfunctions adapted from recent studies on massive star evolution in a low\nmetallicity environment, where globular clusters are formed. In this work, we\nconsider only binaries that are formed by three-body processes and ignore\nstellar evolution and primordial binaries for simplicity. Our results imply\nthat most BH binary mergers take place after they get ejected from the cluster.\nAlso, mass ratios of dynamically formed binaries should be close to one or\nlikely to be less than 2:1. Since the binary formation efficiency is larger for\nhigher-mass BHs, it is likely that a BH mass function sampled by\ngravitational-wave observations would be weighed toward higher masses than the\nmass function of single BHs for a dynamically formed population. Applying\nconservative assumptions regarding globular cluster populations such as small\nBH mass fraction and no primordial binaries, the merger rate of BH binaries\noriginated from globular clusters is estimated to be at least 6.5 per yr per\nGpc^3.

The competitive\naccretion theory of massive star formation posits that the most massive stars\nshould sit in deeper potential wells than lower-mass stars. This may be\nobservable in the relative surface density or spatial concentration of the most\nmassive stars compared to other, lower-mass stars. Massive stars in\ncool--collapse N-body models do end up in significantly deeper potentials, and\nare mass segregated. However, in models of warm (expanding) star-forming\nregions, whilst the massive stars do come to be in deeper potentials than\naverage stars, they are not mass segregated. In the purely hydrodynamical SPH\nsimulations, the massive stars do come to reside in deeper potentials, which is\ndue to their runaway growth. However, when photoionisation and stellar winds\nare implemented in the simulations, these feedback mechanisms regulate the mass\nof the stars and disrupt the inflow of gas into the clouds' potential wells.\nThis generally makes the potential wells shallower than in the control runs,\nand prevents the massive stars from occupying deeper potentials. This in turn\nresults in the most massive stars having a very similar spatial concentration\nand surface density distribution to lower-mass stars. Whilst massive stars do\nform via competitive accretion in our simulations, this rarely translates to a\ndifferent spatial distribution and so any lack of primordial mass segregation\nin an observed star-forming region does not preclude competitive accretion as a\nviable formation mechanism for massive stars. \n\n"}

Atmosphere model computations were improved in two ways. First,\nsince the UV metal line blanketing has a strong impact on the\ntemperature-density stratification, we used the Atlas12 code. Additionally, We\ntested Atlas12 against the benchmark code Sterne3, and found only small\ndifferences in the temperature and density stratifications, and good agreement\nwith the spectral energy distributions. Second, 12 chemical species were\ntreated in non-LTE. Pronounced non-LTE effects occur in individual spectral\nlines but, for the majority, the effects are moderate to small. The\nspectroscopic parameters give $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ = 17 300$\\pm$300 K and $\\log g$\n= 2.80$\\pm$0.10, and an evolutionary mass of 0.55$\\pm$0.05 $M_\\odot$.

The\ndiversity is driven by non-circular motions in the gas; in particular, by\nstrong bisymmetric fluctuations in the azimuthal velocities that the\ntilted-ring model is ill-suited to account for and that are difficult to detect\nin model residuals. Large misestimates of the circular velocity arise when the\nkinematic major axis coincides with the extrema of the fluctuation pattern, in\nsome cases mimicking the presence of kiloparsec-scale density 'cores', when\nnone are actually present. The thickness of APOSTLE discs compounds this\neffect: more slowly-rotating extra-planar gas systematically reduces the\naverage line-of-sight speeds. The recovered rotation curves thus tend to\nunderestimate the true circular velocity of APOSTLE galaxies in the inner\nregions. Non-circular motions provide an appealing explanation for the large\napparent cores observed in galaxies such as DDO 47 and DDO 87, where the model\nresiduals suggest that such motions might have affected estimates of the inner\ncircular velocities. Although residuals from tilted ring models in the\nsimulations appear larger than in observed galaxies, our results suggest that\nnon-circular motions should be carefully taken into account when considering\nthe evidence for dark matter cores in individual galaxies. \n\n"}

This belief is incorrect -- gravitational\nmicrolensing also produces changes in the actual time delays on the ~day(s)\nlight-crossing time scale of the emission region. This is due to a combination\nof the inclination of the disk relative to the line of sight and the\ndifferential magnification of the temperature fluctuations producing the\nvariability. We demonstrate this both mathematically and with direct\ncalculations using microlensing magnification patterns. Measuring these delay\nfluctuations can provide a physical scale for microlensing observations,\nremoving the need for priors on either the microlens masses or the component\nvelocities. That time delays in lensed quasars are themselves time variable\nlikely explains why repeated delay measurements of individual lensed quasars\nappear to vary by more than their estimated uncertainties.

We do this via EFT Feynman diagrams computed in\ntime-ordered perturbation theory, and so recover existing quantum-mechanical\ntechnology such as the two-potential formalism for the treatment of the\nCoulomb-nuclear interference.

In this paper, using the response function formalism, we\nmodel the supersample covariance contributions to the bispectrum covariance and\nthe cross covariance between the power spectrum and the bispectrum. The\nsupersample covariances due to the long wavelength density and tidal\nperturbations are investigated, and the tidal contribution is a few orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the density one because in configuration space the\nbispectrum estimator involves angular averaging and the tidal response function\nis anisotropic.

For the matter\nbispectrum, the ratio between the supersample covariance correction and the\nsmall scale covariance, which can be computed using a periodic box, is roughly\nan order of magnitude smaller than that for the matter power spectrum.

In the formation of gamma-ray bursts,\nrotation and the properties of rotating stars appear as the key factor.

Rotation plays a key role in shaping the\nevolution and nucleosynthesis in massive stars with very low metallicities\n(metallicity below about the Small Magellanic Cloud metallicity down to\nPopulation III stars).

One of the observable\ntests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the\nstellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the\nmain migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep\non evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The\nobserved correlation between effective temperature and measured projected\nobliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such\nmechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal\nevolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide\nfor circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong\nvariations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their\nconsequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical\nformulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for\neach mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For\ntypical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped\non a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis. The final outcome of\ntidal evolution is also very sensitive to the initial conditions, with\nJupiter-mass planets being either quickly destroyed or brought on more distant\norbit, depending on the initial ratio of planetary orbital momentum to stellar\nspin momentum. However we find that everything else being the same, the\nevolution of the obliquity around low-mass stars with a thin convective zone is\nnot slower than around those with a thicker convective zone. On the contrary,\nwe find that more massive stars, remaining faster rotator throughout their\nmain-sequence, produce more efficient dissipation. \n\n"}

{"id": "1804.03676", "contents": "Title: On The Lack of Circumbinary Planets Orbiting Isolated Binary Stars Abstract: We outline a mechanism that explains the observed lack of circumbinary\nplanets (CBPs) via coupled stellar-tidal evolution of isolated binary stars.\nTidal forces between low-mass, short-period binary stars on the pre-main\nsequence slow the stellar rotations, transferring rotational angular momentum\nto the orbit as the stars approach the tidally locked state. This transfer\nincreases the binary orbital period, expanding the region of dynamical\ninstability around the binary, and destabilizing CBPs that tend to\npreferentially orbit just beyond the initial dynamical stability limit. After\nthe stars tidally lock, we find that angular momentum loss due to magnetic\nbraking can significantly shrink the binary orbit, and hence the region of\ndynamical stability, over time impacting where surviving CBPs are observed\nrelative to the boundary. We perform simulations over a wide range of parameter\nspace and find that the expansion of the instability region occurs for most\nplausible initial conditions and that in some cases, the stability semi-major\naxis doubles from its initial value. We examine the dynamical and observable\nconsequences of a CBP falling within the dynamical instability limit by running\nN-body simulations of circumbinary planetary systems and find that typically,\nat least one planet is ejected from the system.

All of these characteristics are consistent\nwith models of self-scattering of submillimeter-wave emission from an optically\nthin inclined disk. The distribution of the polarization position angles across\nthe disk reveals that while the average orientation is along the minor axis,\nthe polarization orientations show a significant spread in angles; this can\nalso be explained by models of pure scattering. We compare the polarization\nwith that of the Class I/II source HL Tau. A comparison of cuts of the\npolarization fraction across the major and minor axes of both sources reveals\nthat IM Lup has a substantially higher polarization fraction than HL Tau toward\nthe center of the disk. This enhanced polarization fraction could be due a\nnumber of factors, including higher optical depth in HL Tau, or scattering by\nlarger dust grains in the more evolved IM Lup disk.

The radial velocity of a star is\nobtained through a fit of the RVS spectrum relative to an appropriate synthetic\ntemplate spectrum. An additional task of the spectroscopic pipeline was to\nprovide 1st-order estimates of the stellar atmospheric parameters required to\nselect such template spectra. We describe the pipeline features and present the\ndetailed calibration algorithms and software solutions we used to produce the\nradial velocities published in DR2.

Planet radius measurements are, in turn, improved to 5%\nprecision. With a catalog of ~1000 planets with precise properties, we probed\nin fine detail the gap in the planet size distribution that separates two\nclasses of small planets, rocky super-Earths and gas-dominated sub-Neptunes.\nOur previous study and others suggested that the gap may be observationally\nunder-resolved and inherently flat-bottomed, with a band of forbidden planet\nsizes. Analysis based on our new catalog refutes this; the gap is partially\nfilled in. Two other important factors that sculpt the distribution are a\nplanet's orbital distance and its host star mass, both of which are related to\na planet's X-ray/UV irradiation history. For lower mass stars, the bimodal\nplanet distribution shifts to smaller sizes, consistent with smaller stars\nproducing smaller planet cores. Details of the size distribution including the\nextent of the `sub-Neptune desert' and the width and slope of the gap support\nthe view that photoevaporation of low-density atmospheres is the dominant\nevolutionary determinant of the planet size distribution. \n\n"}

While the SMBH growth\nchannels, mergers and gas accretion, are well established, their origin remains\nuncertain: they could have either emerged from massive \"seeds\" ($10^5-10^6\nM_{\\odot}$) formed by direct collapse of gas clouds in the early Universe or\nfrom smaller ($100 M_{\\odot}$) black holes, end-products of first stars. The\nlatter channel would leave behind numerous intermediate mass black holes\n(IMBHs, $10^2-10^5 M_{\\odot}$). Although many IMBH candidates have been\nidentified, none is accepted as definitive, thus their very existence is still\ndebated. Using data mining in wide-field sky surveys and applying dedicated\nanalysis to archival and follow-up optical spectra, we identified a sample of\n305 IMBH candidates having masses $3\\times10^4<M_{\\mathrm{BH}}<2\\times10^5\nM_{\\odot}$, which reside in galaxy centers and are accreting gas that creates\ncharacteristic signatures of a type-I active galactic nucleus (AGN).

In this last year we discovered two rare Of-type stars: an\nO6.5f?p and an O6nfp in addition to the two new Of?p stars discovered in our\nfirst year and the three Onfp stars discovered in our second and third years.\nHowever, even more exciting was our discovery of a new type of WR, ones we are\ncalling WN3/O3s due to their spectroscopic signatures. We describe the\ncompleteness limits of our survey and demonstrate that we are sensitive to\nweak-lined WRs several magnitudes fainter than any we have discovered, arguing\nthat there is not a population of fainter WRs waiting to be discovered. We\ndiscuss the nature of the WN3/O3s, summarizing the results of our extensive\nspectroscopy and modeling. We also examine the important claim made by others\nthat the WN3/O3s are isolated compared to other massive stars. We find that if\nwe use a more complete sample of reference massive stars, the WN3/O3s show the\nsame spatial distribution as other early WNs, consistent with a common origin.\nFinally, we use this opportunity to present the \"Fifth Catalog of LMC\nWolf-Rayet Stars,\" which includes revised coordinates and updated spectral\ntypes for all 154 known LMC WRs. \n\n"}

Their strong mass-loss furthermore\nprovides challenges and constraints to the theory of radiatively driven winds.\nThus, the determination of the WC star parameters is of major importance for\nseveral astrophysical fields. With Gaia DR2, for the first time parallaxes for\na large sample of Galactic WC stars are available, removing major uncertainties\ninherent to earlier studies. In this work, we re-examine the sample from Sander\net al. (2012) to derive key properties of the Galactic WC population. All\nquantities depending on the distance are updated, while the underlying spectral\nanalyses remain untouched. Contrasting earlier assumptions, our study yields\nthat WC stars of the same subtype can significantly vary in absolute magnitude.\nWith Gaia DR2, the picture of the Galactic WC population becomes more complex:\nWe obtain luminosities ranging from log L = 4.9 to 6.0 with one outlier having\nlog L = 4.7. This indicates that the WC stars are likely formed from a broader\ninitial mass range than previously assumed. We obtain mass-loss rates ranging\nbetween log Mdot = -5.1 and -4.1, with Mdot propto L^0.68 and a linear scaling\nof the modified wind momentum with luminosity. We discuss the implications for\nstellar evolution, including unsolved issues regarding the need of envelope\ninflation to address the WR radius problem, and the open questions in regard to\nthe connection of WR stars with Gamma-ray bursts. WC and WO stars are\nprogenitors of massive black holes, collapsing either silently or in a\nsupernova that most-likely has to be preceded by a WO stage. \n\n"}

This paper focuses on the mid-IR\nspectral region between 9.7 um to 40 um for T Tauri stars. The generated\nspectra contain several tens of thousands of molecular emission lines of H2O,\nOH, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2, H2 and a few other molecules, as well as the forbidden\natomic emission lines of SI, SII, SIII, SiII, FeII, NeII, NeIII, ArII and\nArIII. In contrast to previously published works, we do not treat the\nabundances of the molecules nor the temperature in the disc as free parameters,\nbut use the complex results of detailed 2D ProDiMo disc models concerning gas\nand dust temperature structure, and molecular concentrations. FLiTs computes\nthe line emission spectra by ray tracing in an efficient, fast and reliable\nway. The results are broadly consistent with R=600 Spitzer/IRS observational\ndata of T Tauri stars concerning line strengths, colour, and line ratios. In\norder to achieve that agreement, however, we need to assume either a high\ngas/dust mass ratio of order 1000, or the presence of illuminated disc walls at\ndistances of a few au. The molecules in these walls cannot be photo-dissociated\neasily by UV because of the large densities in the walls which favour their\nre-formation. Most observable molecular emission lines are found to be\noptically thick, rendering a standard analysis with column densities difficult.\nWe find that the difference between gas and dust temperatures in the disc\nsurface is important for the line formation. We briefly discuss the effects of\nC/O ratio and choice of chemical rate network on these results. Our analysis\noffers new ways to infer the chemical and temperature structure of T Tauri\ndiscs from future JWST/MIRI observations, and to possibly detect secondary\nilluminated disc walls based on their specific mid-IR molecular signature. \n\n"}

Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the kinematic properties of the multiple\npopulations (MPs) in the low-mass Galactic globular cluster NGC6362 based on a\nsample of about 500 member stars for which radial velocities (RVs), Fe and Na\nabundances have been homogeneously derived. At distances from the cluster\ncenter larger than about 0.5 $r_h$, we find that first (FG - Na-poor) and\nsecond generation (SG - Na-rich) stars show hints of different line-of-sight\nvelocity dispersion profiles, with FG stars being dynamically hotter. This is\nthe first time that differences in the velocity dispersion of MPs are detected\nby using only RVs. While kinematic differences between MPs in globular clusters\nare usually described in terms of anisotropy differences driven by the\ndifferent radial distributions, this explanation seems hardly viable for\nNGC6362, where SG and FG stars are spatially mixed. We demonstrate that the\nobserved difference in the velocity dispersion profiles can be accounted for by\nthe effect of binary stars. In fact, thanks to our multi-epoch RV measurements\nwe find that the binary fraction is significantly larger in the FG sample\n(f~14%) than in SG population (f<1%), and we show that such a difference can\ninflate the velocity dispersion of FG with respect to SG by the observed amount\nin the relevant radial range.

Structure formation in the presence of massive neutrinos is\ntherefore impeded compared to that in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with\nmassless neutrinos.

These planet candidates are suitable\nfor further spectroscopic follow-up and precise mass determinations, leading\nultimately to the construction of empirical mass-radius diagrams. Particularly\ninteresting is to constrain the properties of planets between the Earth and\nNeptune in size, the most abundant type of planets orbiting Sun-like stars with\nperiods less than a few years. Among many other K2 candidates, we discovered a\nmulti-planetary system around EPIC246471491, with four planets ranging in size\nfrom twice the size of Earth, to nearly the size of Neptune. We measure the\nmass of the planets of the EPIC246471491 system by means of precise radial\nvelocity measurements using the CARMENES spectrograph and the HARPS-N\nspectrograph.

Aims.\nWe investigate the effect of metallicity and effective temperature on the\nphotometric brightness change of Sun-like stars seen at different inclinations.\nThe considered range of fundamental stellar parameters is sufficiently small so\nthe stars, investigated here, still count as Sun-like or even as solar twins.\nMethods. To model the brightness change of stars with solar magnetic activity,\nwe extend a well established model of solar brightness variations, SATIRE\n(which stands for Spectral And Total Irradiance Reconstruction), which is based\non solar spectra, to stars with different fundamental parameters. For that we\ncalculate stellar spectra for different metallicities and effective temperature\nusing the radiative transfer code ATLAS9. Results. We show that even a small\nchange (e.g. within the observational error range) of metallicity or effective\ntemperature significantly affects the photometric brightness change compared to\nthe Sun. We find that for Sun-like stars, the amplitude of the brightness\nvariations obtained for Str\\\"omgren (b + y)/2 reaches a local minimum for\nfundamental stellar parameters close to the solar metallicity and effective\ntemperature. Moreover, our results show that the effect of inclination\ndecreases for metallicity values greater than the solar metallicity. Overall,\nwe find that an exact determination of fundamental stellar parameters is\ncrucially important for understanding stellar brightness changes. \n\n"}

By tracking the bulge star\nparticles back in time, we find that on average 95\\% of the bulge stars formed\n{\\it in situ}, 3\\% formed {\\it ex situ} in satellites of the same halo, and\nonly 2\\% formed {\\it ex situ} in external galaxies. The evolution of the AM\ndistribution of the bulge stars paints an interesting picture: the higher the\nfinal $B/T$ ratio, the more the specific AM remains preserved during the bulge\nformation. In all cases, bulge stars migrate significantly towards the central\nregion, reducing their average galactocentric radius by roughly a factor 2,\nindependently of the final $B/T$ value. However, in the higher $B/T$\n($\\gtrsim0.2$) objects, the velocity of the bulge stars increases and the AM of\nthe bulge is almost conserved, whereas at lower $B/T$ values, the velocity of\nthe bulge stars decreases and the AM of bulge reduces. The correlation between\nthe evolution of the AM and $B/T$ suggests that bulge and disc formation are\nclosely linked and cannot be treated as independent processes. \n\n"}

Models of this\nreflected spectrum generally assume that the accretion disk can be\ncharacterized by material in a single ionization state. However, several\nauthors have recently stressed the importance of the classic ionization\ninstability for X-ray irradiated gas in hydrostatic balance. This instability\nleads to a discontinuous transition in the vertical structure of the disk,\nresulting in a hot ionized skin above much cooler material. If the Compton\ntemperature of the skin is high then even iron is completely ionized, and the\nskin does not produce any spectral features. These new models, where the\nionization structure of the disk is calculated self-consistently, require an\nexcessive amount of computing power and so are difficult to use in directly\nfitting observed X-ray spectra. Instead, we invert the problem by simulating\nX-ray spectra produced by the new reflection models, and then fit these with\nthe old, single zone reflection models, to assess the extent to which the\nderived accretion geometry depends on the reflection model used. We find that\nthe single zone ionization models can severely underestimate the covering\nfraction of the ``cold'' material as seen from the X-ray source if the optical\ndepth in the ionized skin is of order unity, and that this can produce an\napparent correlation between the covering fraction and the X-ray spectral index\nsimilar in nature to that reported by Zdziarski, Lubinski and Smith (1999). \n\n"}

We focus on iron-peak elements\nand, in particular, we try to reproduce the large [Zn/Fe] observed in extremely\nmetal-poor stars.

We identify four important factors for\nunderstanding rapid star formation and short cloud lifetimes. First, much of\nthe accumulation and dispersal of clouds near the solar circle might occur in\nthe atomic phase; only the high-density portion of a cloud's lifecycle is spent\nin the molecular phase, thus helping to limit molecular cloud ``lifetimes''.\nSecond, once a cloud achieves a high enough column density to form $\\h2$ and\nCO, gravitational forces become larger than typical interstellar pressure\nforces; thus star formation can follow rapidly upon molecular gas formation and\nturbulent dissipation in limited areas of each cloud complex. Third, typical\nmagnetic fields are not strong enough to prevent rapid cloud formation and\ngravitational collapse. Fourth, rapid dispersal of gas by newly-formed stars,\nand reduction of shielding by a small expansion of the cloud after the first\nevents of star formation, might limit the length of the star formation epoch\nand the lifetime of a cloud in its molecular state. This picture emphasizes the\nimportance of large-scale boundary conditions for understanding molecular cloud\nformation, and implies that star formation is a highly dynamic, rather than\nquasi-static, process. \n\n"}

Part of the {\\sl Chandra}\ndata was studied by Yusef-Zadeh, Law, & Wardle (2002), who reported the\ndetection of 6.4-keV line emission in this region. We find, however, that this\nline emission is {\\sl not} associated with G0.13-0.11. The X-ray spectra of\nboth G0.13-0.11 and the point-like source embedded are well characterized by a\npower law. The 2 -- 10 keV band luminosities of these two components are $\\sim\n3.2\\times 10^{33}{\\rm ergs s^{-1}}$ (G0.13-0.11) and $\\sim 7.5 \\times10^{32}\n{\\rm ergs s^{-1}}$ (point source) at the Galactic center distance of 8 kpc. The\nmorphological, spectral, and luminosity properties strongly indicate that\nG0.13-0.11 represents the leading-edge of a pulsar wind nebula, produced by a\npulsar (point source) moving in a strong magnetic field environment. The main\nbody of this pulsar wind nebula is likely traced by a bow-shaped radio feature,\nwhich is apparently bordered by G0.13-0.11 and is possibly associated with the\nprominent nonthermal radio filaments of the Radio Arc. We speculate that young\npulsars may be responsible for various unique nonthermal filamentary radio and\nX-ray features observed in the Galactic center region. \n\n"}

We confirm both the early\nconjecture from linear analysis and the later results based on preformed MHD\nbubbles; namely, that very modest ICM magnetic fields can stabilize the rising\nbubbles against disruption by Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities. We find in addition that amplification of the ambient fields as\nthey stretch around the bubbles can be sufficient to protect the bubbles or\ntheir initial fragments even if the fields are initially much too weak to play\na significant role early in the evolution of the bubbles. Indeed, even with\ninitial fields less than a micro-Gauss and values of $\\beta = P_g/P_b$\napproaching $10^5$, magnetic stresses in our simulations eventually became\nlarge enough to influence the bubble evolution. Magnetic field influence also\ndepends significantly on the geometry of the ICM field and on the topology of\nthe field at the bubble/ICM interface.

Based on the assumption that these tails\nand flares are of internal shock origin and that their decline behaviors are\ndominated by the curvature effect of the fireball, we present a\nself-consistency test for this scenario with a sample of 36\nprompt-emission-tails/flare-tails in 22 GRB XRT light curves. Our results show\nthat the t0 of the prompt emission tails and the tails of well-separated flares\nare usually at the rising segment of the last pulse of the prompt emission or\nthe corresponding X-ray flare, being self-consistent with the expectation of\nthe internal dissipation models for the prompt emission and X-ray flares. Our\nresults indicate that each X-ray flare forms a distinct new episode of central\nengine activity and the GRB central engine remains active after the prompt\nemission is over, sometimes up to ~1 day after the GRB trigger (e.g. GRB\n050502B & GRB 050724). This challenges the conventional central engine models\nand calls for new ideas to re-start the central engine. We further show that\nthe on-set time of the late central engine activity does not depend on the GRB\nduration. We also identify a minority group of GRBs whose combined BAT-XRT\nlight curves are smoothly connected without an abrupt transition between the\nprompt emission and the afterglow. These GRBs may have an external origin for\nboth the prompt emission and the afterglow. \n\n"}

This result means that the evolution of the number densities is\ndifferential with UV luminosity: the number density of UV luminous objects\nremains almost constant from z~5 to 3 while the number density of fainter\nobjects gradually increases with cosmic time. This trend becomes apparent\nthanks to the small uncertainties in number densities both in the bright and\nfaint parts of LFs at different epochs that are made possible by the deep and\nwide surveys.

Non-LTE\ncalculations are performed, and the relative importance of the collision\nprocesses is investigated.\n  Results: Our calculations show electron collisions alone are not sufficient\nto establish LTE for the formation of Balmer line wings. The role of inelastic\ncollisions with neutral hydrogen is unclear. The available data for these\nprocesses is of questionable quality, and different prescriptions for the rate\ncoefficents give significantly different results for the Balmer line wings.\n  Conclusions: Improved calculations or experimental data are needed for\nexcitation and, particularly, ionisation of hydrogen atoms in low-lying states\nby hydrogen atom impact at near threshold energies. Until such data are\navailable, the assumption of LTE for the formation of Balmer line wings in\nlate-type stars is questionable. \n\n"}

Abstract: It has been suggested that cosmological gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can produce\nthe observed flux and spectrum of cosmic rays at the highest energies. However,\nrecent observations indicate that the redshift distribution of GRBs most likely\nfollows that of the star formation rate in the universe, a rate which was much\nhigher at redshifts 1.5-2 than it is today. Thus, most GRBs are at high\nredshifts. As a consequence, any cosmic rays emitted by these GRBs at energies\nabove 2-3 X 10^{19} eV would be strongly attenuated by interactions with the 3K\nbackground radiation. If one assumes rough equality between the energy released\nin 10^{-2} to 1 MeV photons and that released in 10^{20} eV cosmic rays, then\nless than 10 per cent of the cosmic rays observed above 10^{20} eV can be\naccounted for by GRBs. \n\n"}

The presence of\na fundamental scale suggests that local Lorentz invariance may be violated at\nsufficiently high energies. Motivated by this possibility, recently, different\nmodels that violate Lorentz invariance locally have been used to evaluate the\ntrans-Planckian corrections to the inflationary density perturbation spectrum.\nHowever, certain astrophysical observations seem to indicate that local Lorentz\ninvariance may be preserved to extremely high energies. In such a situation, to\nstudy the trans-Planckian effects, it becomes imperative to consider models\nthat preserve local Lorentz invariance even as they contain a fundamental\nscale.
