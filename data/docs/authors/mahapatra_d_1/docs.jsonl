To address this problem\nwe combine our earlier developed quark recombination model with quark\nphase-space distributions computed from relativistic Langevin simulations in an\nexpanding Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Hadronization is based on resonance\nformation within a Boltzmann equation which recovers thermal equilibrium and\nobeys energy conservation in the quark-coalescence process, while the fireball\nbackground is adjusted to hydrodynamic simulations of semi-central Au-Au\ncollisions at RHIC. To facilitate the applicability of the Langevin process, we\nfocus on strange and charm quarks.

The extracted $\\omega$ line shape was found to be sensitive to\nthe background subtraction. For this reason a re-analysis of the same data set\nhas been initiated and a new method has been developed to reduce the background\nand to determine the shape and absolute magnitude of the background directly\nfrom the data. Details of the re-analysis and of the background determination\nare described. The $\\omega$ signal on the $Nb$ target, extracted in the\nre-analysis, does not show a deviation from the corresponding line shape on a\n$LH_2$ target, measured as reference. The earlier claim of an in-medium mass\nshift is thus not confirmed. The sensitivity of the $\\omega$ line shape to\ndifferent in-medium modification scenarios is discussed. \n\n"}

To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the\npropagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we\nadopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the $(1+1)$\nquasi-Abelian Schwinger theory.

We find that this effect is enough to spoil quark number scaling\nin elliptic flow. A lack of scaling in data therefore does not signal the\nabsence of partonic degrees of freedom and hadronization by coalescence. In a\ncoalescing partonic fluid, however, elliptic flow of anti-baryons should be the\ngreater than that of baryons, since antibaryons contain a greater admixture of\npartons from the highly flowing midrapidity region. Intriguingly, purely\nhadronic dynamics has a similar dependence of baryon-anti-baryons $v_2$ as\npurely partonic dynamics, again because antibaryons tend to come from regions\nwhere the deviation of the system from hydrodynamic behavior is at its\nsmallest.

The differences between the\nproton and neutron form factors and the deviation of GEn from zero are\nsensitive to the difference between up- and down-quark contributions to the\nform factors.\n  Methods: We combine recent measurements of the neutron form factors with\nupdated extractions of the proton form factors, accounting for two-photon\nexchange corrections and including an estimate of the uncertainties for all of\nthe form factors to obtain a complete set of measurements up to Q^2\napproximately 4 (GeV/c)^2.

The\nhadronic re-scattering of the $K^*$ decay daughter particles ($\\pi$ and K) will\nalter their momentum distribution thereby making it difficult to reconstruct\nthe $K^*$ signal through the invariant mass method. An increased hadronic\nre-scattering effect thus leads to a decrease in the reconstructed yield of\n$K^*$ in heavy-ion collisions. Through this simulation study we argue that a\ndecrease in $K^*$/K ratio with increase in collision centrality necessarily\nreflects the hadronic re-scattering effect. Since the re-scattering occurs in\nthe hadronic phase and $K^*$ has a lifetime of 4 fm/c, we present a toy model\nbased discussion on using measured $K^*$/K to put a lower limit on the hadronic\nphase lifetime in high energy nuclear collisions. \n\n"}

The entropy per baryon values extracted from the data at\nthe different energies are a robust observable: it is almost independent of the\ndetails of the modeling of the eigenvolume interactions and of the specific\n$T-\\mu_B$ values obtained. These results show that the extraction of the\nchemical freeze-out temperature and chemical potential is extremely sensitive\nto the modeling of the short-range repulsion between the hadrons. This implies\nthat the ideal point-particle HRG values are not unique. The wide range of the\nextracted $T$ and $\\mu_B$ values suggested by the eigenvolume HRG fits, as well\nas the approximately constant $S/A$ at freeze-out, are consistent with a\nnon-equilibrium scenario of continuous freeze-out, where hadrons can be\nchemically frozen-out throughout the extended space-time regions during the\nevolution of the system. Even when the EV HRG fits are restricted to modest\ntemperatures suggested by lattice QCD, the strong systematic effects of EV\ninteractions are observed. \n\n"}

Using a repositotory of\nover 700,000 chest radiographs, in this study we demonstrate that promising\nnodule detection performance can be achieved using weak labels through\nconvolutional neural networks for radiograph classification.

We introduce the\nEnergy Density Functionals (EDFs) that are used in nuclear structure, with few\nexamples of their applications. The concepts of symmetry breaking and\nrestoration are briefly discussed. We also include an introduction to the\ntime-dependent extension of DFT that, so far, has been implemented essentially\nonly in the adiabatic approximation and has been applied mainly to the study of\nnuclear vibrations. With this material, we hope that any reader is able to deal\nwith the texts that go deeper into each of the topics, having understood that\nDFT is probably the best compromise in nuclear structure theory between\nsimplicity, accuracy, and broad range of applicability. \n\n"}

Furthermore, despite non-monotonic fluctuations in the energy\nloss, we use an event generator to validate the strong correlation between the\n$p_T$ of the parton that initiates a heavy-ion jet and the $p_T$ of the vacuum\njet which corresponds to it via the quantile procedure ($p_T^{\\rm quant}$). We\ndemonstrate that this strategy both provides a complementary way to study jet\nmodification and mitigates the effect of $p_T$ migration in heavy-ion\ncollisions. \n\n"}

The incident momenta varied from 5.9 to 14.4 GeV/c,\ncorresponding to 4.8 < Q^2 < 12.7 (GeV/c)^2. First, we describe the\nmeasurements with the newer experiment, E850, which had more complete kinematic\ndefinition of quasielastic events. In E850 the angular dependence of the\nnuclear transparency near 90 Deg. c.m., and the nuclear transparency for\ndeuterons was studied. Second, we review the techniques used in an earlier\nexperiment, E834, and show that the two experiments are consistent for the\nCarbon data. E834 also determines the nuclear transparencies for Li, Al, Cu,\nand Pb nuclei as well as for C. We find for both E850 and E834 that the A(p,2p)\nnuclear transparency, unlike that for A(e,e'p) nuclear transparency, is\nincompatible with a constant value versus energy as predicted by Glauber\ncalculations. The A(p,2p) nuclear transparency for C and Al increases by a\nfactor of two between 5.9 and 9.5 GeV/c incident proton momentum. At its peak\nthe A(p,2p) nuclear transparency is about 80% of the constant A(e,e'p) nuclear\ntransparency. Then the nuclear transparency falls back to the Glauber level\nagain. This oscillating behavior is generally interpreted as an interplay\nbetween two components of the pN scattering amplitude; one short ranged and\nperturbative, and the other long ranged and strongly absorbed in the nuclear\nmedium. We suggest a number of experiments for further studies of nuclear\ntransparency effects. \n\n"}

The possible connection between the presence of a\nfluctuation peak and the occurrence of a phase transition or a critical\nphenomenon is critically analyzed. Many different phenomena can lead both to\nthe creation and to the suppression of a fluctuation peak. In particular, the\nrole of constraints due to conservation laws and to data sorting is shown to be\nessential. From the experimental point of view, a comparison of the available\nfragmentation data reveals that there is a good agreement between different\ndata sets of basic fluctuation observables, if the fragmenting source is of\ncomparable size. This compatibility suggests that the fragmentation process is\nlargely independent of the reaction mechanism (central versus peripheral\ncollisions, symmetric versus asymmetric systems, light ions versus heavy ion\ninduced reactions).

The low-energy constants (LECs) related to pion-nucleon vertices are\ntaken consistently from studies of pion-nucleon scattering in chiral\nperturbation theory. The total of 26 four-nucleon LECs has been determined by a\ncombined fit to some np and pp phase shifts from the Nijmegen analysis together\nwith the nn scattering length. The description of nucleon-nucleon scattering\nand the deuteron observables at N^3LO is improved compared to the one at NLO\nand NNLO. The theoretical uncertainties in observables are estimated based on\nthe variation of the cut-offs in the spectral function representation of the\npotential and in the regulator utilized in the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. \n\n"}

A decomposition of the internal wave-function of the\n{$N$-body} system in terms of overlap functions allows a model-independent\nanalysis of medium-range and asymptotic properties of the internal one-body\ndensity. The existence of a spatially decorrelated region in the density\nprofile is related to the existence of three typical energy scales in the\nexcitation spectrum of the {$(N-1)$-body} system.

{"id": "nucl-th/9611031", "contents": "Title: Resonance contributions to HBT correlation radii Abstract: We study the effect of resonance decays on intensity interferometry for heavy\nion collisions. Collective expansion of the source leads to a dependence of the\ntwo-particle correlation function on the pair momentum K. This opens the\npossibility to reconstruct the dynamics of the source from the K-dependence of\nthe measured HBT radii. Here we address the question to what extent resonance\ndecays can fake such a flow signal. Within a simple parametrization for the\nemission function we present a comprehensive analysis of the interplay of flow\nand resonance decays on the one- and two-particle spectra.
