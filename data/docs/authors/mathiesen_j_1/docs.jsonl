The study of diffusion on such networks is\nmotivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronization\nproblems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport on\nnetworks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a rich\nphase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context of\nrandom walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:\nin the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, and\nin the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to the\nmotion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established that\nin a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small density\nof, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interaction\ntopology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In some\ncases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in the\nEdwards-Wilkinson process in \"low-dimensional\" small-world networks. This\nbreak-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, where\nthe mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of a\nnaive perturbation expansion.

Furthermore, the spin-spin correlation function is a\nconstant at long distances, and it does not show an exponential decay in\ncontrast to short-range models.

Interfacing the\nrealism of density-functional based methods with the virtues of Hubbard-like\nHamiltonians, requires the joint ab initio construction of transfer integrals\nand interaction matrix elements (like the Hubbard U) in a localized basis set.\nIn this work, we employ the scheme of maximally localized Wannier functions and\nthe constrained random phase approximation to create effective low-energy\nmodels for Manganese monoxide, and track their evolution under external\npressure. We find that in the low pressure antiferromagnetic phase, the\ncompression results in an increase of the bare Coulomb interaction for specific\norbitals.

We show that high\nTc's above 15 K only emerge if the iron-arsenide layers are at most free of\nplatinum-substitution (x \\rightarrow 0) in contrast to recent reports. In fact\nPt-substitution is detrimental to higher Tc, which increases up to 38 K only by\ncharge doping of pure FeAs layers. We point out, that two different negatively\ncharged layers [(FeAs)10]n- and (Pt3+yAs8)m- compete for the electrons provided\nby the Ca2+ ions, which is unique in the field of iron-based superconductors.\nIn the parent compound Ca10(FeAs)10(Pt3As8), no excess charge dopes the\nFeAs-layer, and superconductivity has to be induced by Pt-substitution, albeit\nbelow 15 K. In contrast, the additional Pt-atom in the Pt4As8layer shifts the\ncharge balance between the layers equivalent to charge doping by 0.2 electrons\nper FeAs. Only in this case Tc raises to 38 K, but decreases again if\nadditionally platinum is substituted for iron. This charge doping scenario is\nsupported by our discovery of superconductivity at 30 K in the electron-doped\nLa-1038 compound (Ca0.8La0.2)10(FeAs)10(Pt3As8) without significant\nPt-substitution. \n\n"}

This can be explained by a minimal nonfactorable model combining\nflow-induced melting of a glass with the buildup of stress carried by strained\npolymers.

As a consequence, since memristances, memcapacitances, and\nmeminductances are simply response functions, they are not necessarily finite.\nThis means that, unlike what has always been argued in some literature,\ndiverging and non-crossing input-output curves of all these memory elements are\nphysically possible in both quantum and classical regimes.

A $k-$sample drawn from the $n-$species abundances vector is the\none obtained while conditioning it on summing to $k$% . We discuss the sampling\nformulae (species occupancy distributions, frequency of frequencies) in this\ncontext. We then develop some aspects of the estimation of $n$ problem from the\nsize $k$ of the sample and the observed value of $P_{n,k}$, the number of\ndistinct sampled species. It is shown that it always makes sense to study these\noccupancy problems from a Gibbs-Poisson abundance model in the context of a\npopulation with infinitely many species. From this extension, a parameter\n$\\gamma $ naturally appears, which is a measure of richness or diversity of\nspecies. We rederive the sampling formulae for a population with infinitely\nmany species, together with the distribution of the number $P_{k}$ of distinct\nsampled species. We investigate the estimation of $\\gamma $ problem from the\nsample size $k$ and the observed value of $P_{k}$.

This method allowed us to calculate the evolution of the magnetic\ncouplings as a function of an applied electric field. We found that in $\\rm\nYMnO_3$ the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya contribution to the magneto-electric effect\nis three orders of magnitude weaker than the electrostrictive contribution.\nStrictive effects are thus dominant in the magnetic exchange evolution under an\napplied electric field, and by extension on the magneto-electric effect.

Such intermittent response resembles\nthe behavior of earthquakes or contact depinning, where a well-defined\nlandscape of pinning disorder prohibits the deformation of an elastic medium.\nNevertheless, a disordered solid is evidently different in that pinning\nbarriers of particles are due to neighbors that are also subject to motion.\nMicroscopic yielding leads to destruction of the local microstructure and local\nheating. It is natural to assume that locally a liquid emerges for a finite\ntimescale before cooling down to a transformed configuration. For including\nthis characteristic transient in glass depinning models, we propose a general\nmechanism that involves a \"pin-delay\" time Tpd, during which each region that\nslipped evolves as a fluid.

Guduru postulated that this enhancement should occur\nafter sufficiently large pressure has been applied to any spherical contact.\nAlso, that although the enhancement is limited to the JKR regime of large soft\nmaterials with high adhesion, the DMT limit for the smooth sphere is found\notherwise. However, for hard materials, even the DMT limit for the smooth\nsolids is very hard to observe, which suggest that also adhesion reduction is\nyet not well understood.\n  The limitations of the assumption of simply connected area is here further\ndiscussed, and a well known model for hard particles in contact with rough\nplanes due to Rumpf is used to show that in the range where unbounded increase\nis predicted, orders of magnitude reduction is instead expected for rigid\nsolids. We suggest that Guduru's model may be close to an upper bound to\nadhesion of rough bodies, while the Rumpf-Rabinovich model may be close to a\nlower bound. \n\n"}

A\nnew type of topological invariant, \"rotational Chern number\", is shown to\ncharacterize the topology of this system. As a consequence of the rotational\nChern number, gapless Dirac points are found on the 3D surface of this 4D\nsystem. For a slab with two surfaces, we find that the corresponding low-energy\neffective theory of two surface states can be directly mapped to that of a 3D\nDirac semimetal, suggesting that topological nature of 3D Dirac semimetals can\nbe characterized by rotational Chern number which is defined in 4D. Our scheme\nprovides a new systematic approach to extract topological nature for\ntopological semimetal phases. \n\n"}

Here we derive a simple expression for\nthe three-dimensional electron density near the interface, $n_{3D}$, as a\nfunction of $n_s$ and find that the mobility for LAO/STO-based interfaces\ndepends on $n_{3D}$ in the same way as it does for bulk doped STO. It is known\nthat undoped bulk STO is strongly compensated with $N \\simeq 5 \\times\n10^{18}~\\rm{cm^{-3}}$ background donors and acceptors. In intentionally doped\nbulk STO with a concentration of electrons $n_{3D} < N$ background impurities\ndetermine the electron scattering. Thus, when $n_{3D} < N$ it is natural to see\nin LAO/STO the same mobility as in the bulk. On the other hand, in the bulk\nsamples with $n_{3D} > N$ the mobility collapses because scattering happens on\n$n_{3D}$ intentionally introduced donors. For LAO/STO the polar catastrophe\nwhich provides electrons is not supposed to provide equal number of random\ndonors and thus the mobility should be larger. The fact that the mobility is\nstill the same implies that for the LAO/STO the polar catastrophe model should\nbe revisited. \n\n"}

We study the interplay of these competing tendencies by\nconsidering time evolution combining both unitary and projective dynamics. We\nbegin by constructing a toy model of Bell pair dynamics which demonstrates that\nmeasurements can keep a system in a state of low (i.e. area law) entanglement,\nin contrast with the volume law entanglement produced by generic pure unitary\ntime evolution. While the simplest Bell pair model has area law entanglement\nfor any measurement rate, as seen in certain non-interacting systems, we show\nthat more generic models of entanglement can feature an area-to-volume law\ntransition at a critical value of the measurement rate, in agreement with\nrecent numerical investigations. As a concrete example of these ideas, we\nanalytically investigate Clifford evolution in qubit systems which can exhibit\nan entanglement transition. We are able to identify stabilizer size\ndistributions characterizing the area law, volume law and critical 'fixed\npoints.' We also discuss Floquet random circuits, where the answers depend on\nthe order of limits - one order of limits yields area law entanglement for any\nnon-zero measurement rate, whereas a different order of limits allows for an\narea law - volume law transition.

In the present\npaper, the stability region of all three phases has been established from high\nresolution synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction measurements on a series of\nhighly homogeneous samples with 0.42 <=x<= 0.52. At 20K the monoclinic phase is\nstable in the range 0.46 <=x<= 0.51, and this range narrows as the temperature\nis increased.

In the second and third series, prior to testing the specimens\nare annealed at 130 C for 4 and 24 hours, respectively. Constitutive equations\nare derived for the time-dependent response of semicrystalline polymers at\nisothermal loading. A polymer is treated as an equivalent temporary network of\nmacromolecules bridged by junctions (physical cross-links, entanglements and\ncrystalline lamellae). Under loading, junctions slip with respect to their\npositions in the bulk material (which reflects the viscoplastic behavior),\nwhereas chains separate from their junctions and merge with new ones at random\ntimes (which reflects the viscoelastic response). The network is thought of as\nan ensemble of meso-regions (MR) with various activation energies for\ndetachment of chains from temporary nodes. Adjustable parameters in the\nstress-strain relations are found by fitting observations. Experimental data\ndemonstrate that the shape of the relaxation spectrum (characterized by the\ndistribution of MRs with various potential energies) is independent of\nmechanical factors, but is altered at annealing. For specimens not subjected to\nthermal treatment, the growth of longitudinal strain does not affect the volume\nfraction of active MRs and the attempt rate for detachment of chains from their\njunctons. For annealed samples, the concentration of active MRs increases and\nthe attempt rate decreases with strain.

Hence this allows to\naccess the temperature range around T_c of the so-called mode coupling theory,\nwhereas the dynamics around the experimental glass transition is completely out\nof reach. While methods such as ``parallel tempering'' improve the situation\nsomewhat, a method that allows to span a significant part of the region T_g\\leq\nT\\leq T_c is still lacking. Only for abstract models such as the infinite range\n10-state Potts glass with a few hundred spins this region can be explored.\nHowever this model suffers from very strong finite size effects thus making it\ndifficult to extrapolate the results obtained for the finite system sizes to\nthe thermodynamic limit.

First, we note that the symmetry breaking transition of the\nferromagetic Ising model maps onto a non-symmetry breaking transition in dimer\nlanguage -- instead it becomes a deconfinement transition for test monomers.\nNext, we introduce a modification of Fisher's mapping in which a second dimer\nmodel, also equivalent to the Ising model, is defined on a generically\ndifferent lattice derived from the dual. In contrast to Fisher's original\nmapping, this enables us to reformulate frustrated Ising models as dimer models\nwith positive weights and we illustrate this by providing a new solution of the\nfully frustrated Ising model on the square lattice. Finally, by means of the\nmodified mapping we show that a large class of three-dimensional Ising models\nare precisely equivalent, in the time continuum limit, to particular quantum\ndimer models. As Ising models in three dimensions are dual to Ising gauge\ntheories, this further yields an exact map between the latter and the quantum\ndimer models. The paramagnetic phase in Ising language maps onto a deconfined,\ntopologically ordered phase in the dimer models.

For all investigated\ntemperatures both kinds of particles jump and both irreversible and reversible\njumps occur. With increasing temperature relaxation is enhanced by an\nincreasing number of jumps, and growing jump lengths in position and potential\nenergy. However, the waiting time between two successive jumps is independent\nof temperature. This temperature independence might be due to aging, which is\npresent in our system. The ratio of irreversible to reversible jumps is also\nincreasing with increasing temperature, which we interpret as a consequence of\nthe increased likelihood of changes in the cages, i.e. a blocking of the\n\"entrance\" back into the previous cage. A comparison of the fluctuations of\njumping particles and non-jumping particles indicates that jumping particles\nare more mobile even when not jumping. The jumps in energy normalized by their\nfluctuations are decreasing with increasing temperature, which is consistent\nwith relaxation being increasingly driven by thermal fluctuations. In\naccordance with subdiffusive behavior are the distributions of waiting times\nand jump lengths in position. \n\n"}

This algorithm facilitates the simulation of\nparticles possessing attractions of short range and arbitrary strength and\ngeometry, an important realization being self-assembling particles endowed with\nstrong, short-ranged and angularly specific (`patchy') attractions. Standard\nMonte Carlo techniques employ sequential updates of particles and suffer from\nlow acceptance rates when attractions are strong. Our algorithm avoids this\nslowing-down by proposing simultaneous moves of collections (clusters) of\nparticles according to gradients of interaction energies. One particle first\nexecutes a `virtual' trial move. We determine which of its neighbours move in a\nsimilar fashion by calculating individual bond energies before and after the\nproposed move. We iterate this procedure and update simultaneously the\npositions of all affected particles. Particles move according to an\napproximation of realistic dynamics without requiring the explicit computation\nof forces, and without the step size restrictions required when integrating\nequations of motion. We also employ a size- and shape-dependent hydrodynamic\ndamping of cluster movements. We discuss the virtual-move algorithm in the\ncontext of other Monte Carlo cluster-move schemes, and demonstrate its utility\nby applying it to a model of biological self-assembly. \n\n"}

We show that even at temperatures\nas high as 4000 K the structure of this system is very similar to the random\ntetrahedral network found in silica at lower temperatures. The temperature\ndependence of the concentration of the defects in this network shows an\nArrhenius law. From the partial structure factors we calculate the neutron\nscattering function and find that it agrees very well with experimental neutron\nscattering data. At low temperatures the temperature dependence of the\ndiffusion constants $D$ shows an Arrhenius law with activation energies which\nare in very good agreement with the experimental values. With increasing\ntemperature we find that this dependence shows a cross-over to one which can be\ndescribed well by a power-law, D\\propto (T-T_c)^gamma. The critical temperature\nT_c is 3330 K and the exponent gamma is close to 2.1. Since we find a similar\ncross-over in the viscosity we have evidence that the relaxation dynamics of\nthe system changes from a flow-like motion of the particles, as described by\nthe ideal version of mode-coupling theory, to a hopping like motion. We show\nthat such a change of the transport mechanism is also observed in the product\nof the diffusion constant and the life time of a Si-O bond, or the space and\ntime dependence of the van Hove correlation functions. \n\n"}
