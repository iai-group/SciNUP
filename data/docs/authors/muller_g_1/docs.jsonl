Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance.

This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors).

From a comparison of simulated and observed\nmaps we are able to constrain the regular large-scale Galactic magnetic field\nin the disk and the halo of the Galaxy. The local regular field is 2 microG and\nthe average random field is about 3 microG. The known local excess of\nsynchrotron emission originating either from enhanced CR electrons or random\nmagnetic fields is able to explain the observed high-latitude synchrotron\nemission.

Developments in observations, theory, and instrumentation have\nprepared the way so that the next decade can be the one in which we finally\nanswer the question, \"What are gamma-ray bursts?\" This question encompasses not\nonly what the progenitors are that produce the GRBs, but also how the enormous\nluminosity of the GRBs, concentrated in gamma rays, is achieved.

The mean depth of the first interaction point and its\nfluctuations are a measure of the proton-air particle production cross section.\nSince the first interaction point in air cannot be measured directly, various\nmethods have been developed in the past to estimate the depth of the first\ninteraction from air shower observables in combination with simulations. As the\nsimulations depend on assumptions made for hadronic particle production at\nenergies and phase space regions not accessible in accelerator experiments, the\nderived cross sections are subject to significant systematic uncertainties. The\nfocus of this work is the development of an improved analysis technique that\nallows a significant reduction of the model dependence of the derived cross\nsection at very high energy. Performing a detailed Monte Carlo study of the\npotential and the limitations of different measurement methods, we quantify the\ndependence of the measured cross section on the used hadronic interaction\nmodel. Based on these results, a general improvement to the analysis methods is\nproposed by introducing the actually derived cross section already in the\nsimulation of reference showers.

This is the most important energy range for absorbing $\\g$-rays from\ndistant sources such as blazars and gamma-ray bursts and producing electron\npositron pairs.

This technique is extended to include post-main\nsequence stars and reprocessing of starlight by dust. In our simple model, the\ntotal energy absorbed by dust is assumed to be re-emitted as three blackbodies\nin the infrared, one at 40 K representing warm, large dust grains, one at 70 K\nrepresenting hot, small dust grains, and one at 450 K representing polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons.

PDS of\naccreting X-ray pulsars where the neutron star is close to the corotation with\nthe accretion disk at the magnetospheric boundary, have a distinct break/cutoff\nat the neutron star spin frequency. This break can naturally be explained in\nthe \"perturbation propagation\" model, which assumes that at any given radius in\nthe accretion disk stochastic perturbations are introduced to the flow with\nfrequencies characteristic for this radius. These perturbations are then\nadvected to the region of main energy release leading to a self-similar\nvariability of X-ray flux P~f^{-1...-1.5}. The break in the PDS is then a\nnatural manifestation of the transition from the disk to magnetospheric flow at\nthe frequency characteristic for the accretion disk truncation radius\n(magnetospheric radius). The proximity of the PDS break frequency to the spin\nfrequency in corotating pulsars strongly suggests that the typical variability\ntime scale in accretion disks is close to the Keplerian one. In transient\naccreting X-ray pulsars characterized by large variations of the mass accretion\nrate during outbursts, the PDS break frequency follows the variations of the\nX-ray flux, reflecting the change of the magnetosphere size with the accretion\nrate. Above the break frequency the PDS steepens to ~f^{-2} law which holds\nover a broad frequency range. These results suggest that strong f^{-1...-1.5}\naperiodic variability which is ubiquitous in accretion disks is not\ncharacteristic for magnetospheric flows. \n\n"}

This process represents a path alternative to thermonuclear\ndisruption of accreting white dwarfs in Type Ia supernovae. Neutrino and\ngravitational-wave (GW) observations may provide crucial information necessary\nto reveal a potential AIC. Motivated by the need for systematic predictions of\nthe GW signature of AIC, we present results from an extensive set of\ngeneral-relativistic AIC simulations using a microphysical finite-temperature\nequation of state and an approximate treatment of deleptonization during\ncollapse. Investigating a set of 114 progenitor models in rotational\nequilibrium, with a wide range of rotational configurations, temperatures and\ncentral densities, we extend previous Newtonian studies and find that the GW\nsignal has a generic shape akin to what is known as a \"Type III\" signal in the\nliterature.

Our observational campaign led to the detection of the\noptical afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 090205 and to the first measure of its\nredshift, z=4.65. Similar to other, recent high-z GRBs, GRB 090205 has a short\nduration in the rest-frame with T_{90,rf}=1.6 s, which suggests the possibility\nthat it might belong to the short GRBs class. The X-ray afterglow of GRB 090205\nshows a complex and interesting behaviour with a possible rebrightening at\n500-1000s from the trigger time and late flaring activity. Photometric\nobservations of the GRB 090205 host galaxy argue in favor of a starburst galaxy\nwith a stellar population younger than ~ 150 Myr. Moreover, the metallicity of\nZ > 0.27 Z_Sun derived from the GRB afterglow spectrum is among the highest\nderived from GRB afterglow measurement at high-z, suggesting that the burst\noccurred in a rather enriched envirorment.

Concerning nonlinear models, the number of\ndegrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of\nreduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of\nreduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain.\nThis uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for\ndifferentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation\nprocedure.

Our observations reveal the\nexistence of large (100 - 200 pc diameter) highly-ionized nebulae, identified\nby diffuse He II (4686 Angstrom) emission, surrounding these sources. Our\nresults are the first to find highly-ionized nebulae of this extent, and the\ndetection in all three objects indicates this may be a common feature of ULXs.\nIn addition to the extended emission, Ho IX X-1 has an unresolved central\ncomponent containing about one-third of the total He II flux, with a\nsignificant velocity dispersion of ~ 370 km/s, suggestive of the existence of a\nphoto-ionized accretion disk or an extremely hot early-type stellar\ncounterpart. Most of the He II emission appears to be surrounded by\nsignificantly more extended Hbeta emission, and the intensity ratios between\nthe two lines, which range from 0.12 - 0.33, indicate that photo-ionization is\nthe origin of the He II emission. Sustaining these extended nebulae requires\nsubstantial X-ray emission, in the range ~ 10^{39} - 10^{40} ergs/s, comparable\nto the measured X-ray luminosities of the sources.

This optical flash appears to be distinct from the subsequent emerging\nafterglow emission, for which we present comprehensive broadband radio to X-ray\nlight curves to 13 days post-burst and rigorously test the standard fireball\nmodel. The intrinsic extinction toward GRB 080603A is high (A_V,z = 0.8 mag),\nand the well-sampled X-ray-to-near-infrared spectral energy distribution is\ninteresting in requiring an LMC2 extinction profile, in contrast to the\nmajority of GRBs. Comparison of the gamma-ray and extinction-corrected optical\nflux densities of the flash rules out an inverse-Compton origin for the prompt\ngamma-rays; instead, we suggest that the optical flash could originate from the\ninhomogeneity of the relativistic flow. In this scenario, a large velocity\nirregularity in the flow produces the prompt gamma-rays, followed by a milder\ninternal shock at a larger radius that would cause the optical flash. Flat\ngamma-ray spectra, roughly F propto nu^-0.1, are observed in many GRBs.

However, since the measurements are also consistent with astrophysical\ninterpretations, the message is unclear. In this paper, we point out that dark\nmatter can have a more distinct signal in cosmic rays, that of a charge\nasymmetry. Such charge asymmetry can result if the dark matter's abundance is\ndue to a relic asymmetry, allowing its decay to generate an asymmetry in\npositrons and electrons. This is analogous to the baryon asymmetry, where\ndecaying neutrons produce electrons and not positrons. We explore benchmark\nscenarios where the dark matter decays into a leptophilic charged Higgs boson\nor electroweak gauge bosons. These models have observable signals in gamma rays\nand neutrinos, which can be tested by Fermi and IceCube. The most powerful test\nwill be at AMS-02, given its ability to distinguish electron and positron\ncharge above 100 GeV. Specifically, an asymmetry favoring positrons typically\npredicts a larger positron ratio and a harder (softer) high energy spectrum for\npositrons (electrons) than charge symmetric sources.

Impact of magnetization and\n  anisotropy of the pulsar wind Abstract: In this paper, we present a numerical study of the properties of the flow\nproduced by the collision of a magnetized anisotropic pulsar wind with its\nenvironment in binary system. We compare the impact of both the magnetic field\nand the wind anisotropy to the benchmark case of a purely hydrodynamical (HD)\ninteraction of isotropic winds, which has been studied in detail by Bogovalov\net al. (2008). We consider the interaction in axisymmetric approximation, i.e.\nthe pulsar rotation axis is assumed to be oriented along the line between the\npulsar and the optical star and the effects related to the pulsar orbiting are\nneglected. The impact of the magnetic field is studied for the case of weak\nmagnetization (with magnetization parameter $\\sigma<0.1$), which is consistent\nwith conventional models of pulsar winds. The effects related to anisotropy in\npulsar winds are modeled assuming that the kinetic energy flux in a\nnon-magnetized pulsar wind is strongly anisotropic, with the minimum at the\npulsar rotation axis and the maximum in the perpendicular direction. We show\nthat, although both considered effects change the shape of the region occupied\nby the terminated pulsar wind, their impact appears to be small. In particular,\nfor the magnetization of the pulsar wind below 0.1, the magnetic field pressure\nremains well below the plasma pressure in the post-shock region. Thus, in the\ncase of interaction of a pulsar with the stellar wind environment (opposite to\nthe case of plerions, i.e. the pulsar interaction with the interstellar medium,\nwhen the magnetic field becomes dynamically important independently on the wind\nmagnetization) the HD approach represents a feasible approximation for\nnumerical modelling. \n\n"}

Here we study this process for the first time, in\nthree-dimensions, and in full general relativity. By considering three initial\nNS configurations, each with and without a surrounding disk (of mass ~7%\nM_{NS}), we investigate the effect of the accretion disk on the dynamics of the\ncollapse and its imprint on both the gravitational wave (GW) and\nelectromagnetic (EM) signals that can be emitted by these sources.

In fact, our simulations show that, while the\ncollapse of an NS in vacuum leaves no appreciable baryonic matter outside the\nevent horizon, an AIC is followed by a phase of rapid accretion of the\nsurviving disk onto the newly formed BH.

Our results point to the existence of two\nqualitatively different regimes of NuDAF evolution: (1) steady accretion with\nquiescent burning; or (2) detonation of the disk. These outcomes are controlled\nprimarily by the ratio of the nuclear energy released to the enthalpy at the\nburning radius.

Including the potential contribution from Population III stars and\nfollowing the cosmic reionization history in a simplified way, the model is\nalso broadly consistent with available data concerning reionization,\nparticularly the Thomson scattering optical depth constraints from WMAP. In\ncomparison with previous EBL studies up to z ~ 3-5, our predicted gamma-gamma\nopacity is in general agreement for observed gamma-ray energy below 400/(1 + z)\nGeV, whereas it is a factor of ~ 2 lower above this energy because of a\ncorrespondingly lower cosmic star formation rate, even though the observed UV\nluminosity is well reproduced by virtue of our improved treatment of dust\nobscuration and direct estimation of star formation rate.

The central physical idea is to focus on on-shell\ndiagrams as objects of fundamental importance to scattering amplitudes. We show\nthat the all-loop integrand in N=4 SYM is naturally represented in this way.\nOn-shell diagrams in this theory are intimately tied to a variety of\nmathematical objects, ranging from a new graphical representation of\npermutations to a beautiful stratification of the Grassmannian G(k,n) which\ngeneralizes the notion of a simplex in projective space. All physically\nimportant operations involving on-shell diagrams map to canonical operations on\npermutations; in particular, BCFW deformations correspond to adjacent\ntranspositions. Each cell of the positive Grassmannian is naturally endowed\nwith positive coordinates and an invariant measure which determines the\non-shell function associated with the diagram. This understanding allows us to\nclassify and compute all on-shell diagrams, and give a geometric understanding\nfor all the non-trivial relations among them. Yangian invariance of scattering\namplitudes is transparently represented by diffeomorphisms of G(k,n) which\npreserve the positive structure. Scattering amplitudes in (1+1)-dimensional\nintegrable systems and the ABJM theory in (2+1) dimensions can both be\nunderstood as special cases of these ideas. On-shell diagrams in theories with\nless (or no) supersymmetry are associated with exactly the same structures in\nthe Grassmannian, but with a measure deformed by a factor encoding ultraviolet\nsingularities.

It would allowed for a liquid ocean on the terrestrial\nsurface which, otherwise, would have been frozen, contrary to the empirical\nevidence. By further assuming that some physical mechanism subsequently\ndisplaced the Earth towards its current distance in such a way that the\nirradiance stayed substantially constant over the entire Archean from 3.8 Gyr\nto 2.5 Gyr ago, a relative recession rate as large as \\dot r/r \\simeq 3.4 x\n10^-11 yr^-1 would have been required. Although such a figure is roughly of the\nsame order of magnitude of the value of the Hubble parameter 3.8 Gyr ago H_Ar =\n1.192 H_0 = 8.2 x 10^-11 yr^-1, standard general relativity rules out\ncosmological explanations for the hypothesized Earth' s recession rate.\nInstead, a class of modified theories of gravitation with nonminimal coupling\nbetween the matter and the metric naturally predicts a secular variation of the\nrelative distance of a localized two-body system, thus yielding a potentially\nviable candidate to explain the putative recession of the Earth' s orbit.\nAnother competing mechanism of classical origin which could, in principle,\nallow for the desired effect is the mass loss which either the Sun or the Earth\nitself may have experienced during the Archean.

Not\nmuch is known about the progenitors of these bursts, but they are\nhighly-energetic, and probably of extragalactic origin. Their properties\nsuggest extreme environments and interesting physics, but in order to\nunderstand and study these events, more examples need to be found. Fortunately,\nthe recent boom in radio astronomy means many 'next-generation' radio\ntelescopes are set to begin observing in the near future. In this paper we\ndiscuss the prospects of detecting short extragalactic bursts, in both\nbeamformed and imaging data, using these instruments.

This effect is larger for\nlow-frequency telescopes, where propagation effects are more prominent, but,\ntheir larger fields-of-view are often enough to compensate for this. Our\nsimulations suggest that the low-frequency component of SKA1 could find an\nextragalactic burst every hour.

However, radially self-similar MHD\njet models, in general, have three geometrical shortcomings, (i) a singularity\nat the jet axis, (ii) the necessary assumption of axisymmetry, and (iii) the\nnon-existence of an intrinsic radial scale, i.e. the jets formally extend to\nradial infinity. Hence, numerical simulations are necessary to extend the\nanalytical solutions towards the axis, by solving the full three-dimensional\nequations of MHD and impose a termination radius at finite radial distance. We\nfocus here on studying the effects of relaxing the (ii) assumption of\naxisymmetry, i.e. of performing full 3D numerical simulations of a disc-wind\ncrossing all magnetohydrodynamic critical surfaces.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data. Because the effect\ndescribed above produces a variability pattern in difference light curves\nbetween pairs of lensed images which is correlated with the time-lagged\ncontinuum variability, it can potentially produce systematic errors in\nmeasurement of time delays between pairs of lensed images.

Therefore they are amongst the most promising candidates for\nindirect dark matter searches.

Raw count maps show a superposition\nof diffuse and point-like emission structures and are subject to shot noise and\ninstrumental artifacts. Using the D3PO inference algorithm, we model the\nobserved photon counts as the sum of a diffuse and a point-like photon flux,\nconvolved with the instrumental beam and subject to Poissonian shot noise. D3PO\nperforms a Bayesian inference in this setting without the use of spatial or\nspectral templates;i.e., it removes the shot noise, deconvolves the\ninstrumental response, and yields estimates for the two flux components\nseparately. The non-parametric reconstruction uncovers the morphology of the\ndiffuse photon flux up to several hundred GeV. We present an all-sky spectral\nindex map for the diffuse component. We show that the diffuse gamma-ray flux\ncan be described phenomenologically by only two distinct components: a soft\ncomponent, presumably dominated by hadronic processes, tracing the dense, cold\ninterstellar medium and a hard component, presumably dominated by leptonic\ninteractions, following the hot and dilute medium and outflows such as the\nFermi bubbles. A comparison of the soft component with the Galactic dust\nemission indicates that the dust-to-soft-gamma ratio in the interstellar medium\ndecreases with latitude. The spectrally hard component exists in a thick\nGalactic disk and tends to flow out of the Galaxy at some locations.\nFurthermore, we find the angular power spectrum of the diffuse flux to roughly\nfollow a power law with an index of 2.47 on large scales, independent of\nenergy.

It is\nwell known that the muon content of air showers generated by the interaction of\ncosmic rays with the atmosphere is rather sensitive to primary mass.

These processes, together with\ncurvature losses and acceleration in the star's electric potential, lead to\ninjection of nuclei with a chemical composition that is mixed, even if only\niron is extracted from the surface. We show that under certain conditions the\nchemical composition injected into the wind region is compatible with that\nrequired in previous work based on purely phenomenological arguments (typically\n$\\sim 50\\%$ protons, $\\sim 30\\%$ CNO and $\\sim 20\\%$ Fe), and provides a\nreasonable explanation of the mass abundance inferred from ultra high energy\ndata. \n\n"}

The current experiments combine two different techniques, an array\nof surface detectors and fluorescence telescopes. The latter allow an almost\ncalorimetric measurement of the primary energy. Thus, hadron-initiated showers\ndetected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator\nfrom the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance\nfrom the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy. On the other hand, this\ncalibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high\nenergy photon has been unambiguously detected so far. Therefore, pure Monte\nCarlo parametrizations are used instead.\n  In this work, we present a new method to determine the primary energy of\nhadron-induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously\ndeveloped for photon primaries. It consists on a set of calibration curves that\nrelate the surface energy estimator, S(r0), and the depth of maximum\ndevelopment of the shower, Xmax, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes.\nThen, the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since\nS(r0) and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed. Considering\na mixed sample of ultra-high energy proton and iron primaries and taking into\naccount the reconstruction uncertainties and shower to shower fluctuations, we\ndemonstrate that the primary energy may be determined with a systematic\nuncertainty below 1% and resolution around 16% in the energy range from\n10^{18.5} to 10^{19.6} eV.

The bolometric peak luminosity of most TDE candidates, a\nfew x 10^{44} erg/s, implies that we observe only ~1% of the energy expected\nfrom radiatively efficient accretion. Motivated by these results, (Piran et\nal., 2015) suggested that the observed optical TDE emission is powered by\nshocks at the apocenter between freshly infalling material and earlier arriving\nmatter. This model explains the small radiated energy, the low temperature, and\nthe large radius implied by the observations as well as the t^{-5/3} light\ncurve. However the question of the system's low {bolometric} efficiency remains\nunanswered. We suggest that the high orbital energy and low angular momentum of\nthe flow make it possible for magnetic stresses to reduce the matter's already\nsmall angular momentum to the point at which it can fall ballistically into the\nSMBH before circularization. As a result, the efficiency is only ~1--10% of a\nstandard accretion disk's efficiency.

In\nthis paper, we apply a unified method to systematically study the\nredshift-dependent event rate densities and the global luminosity functions\n(ignoring redshift evolution) of these transients.

Majorana candidates -\ntriplet, quintuplet, bi-doublet, and bi-triplet - bring only one new parameter\nto the model, their mass, and are hence highly testable at colliders and\nthrough astrophysical observations.

We provide simple analytic\nformulae to calculate the J-factors for spherical cusps obeying the empirical\nrelationship between enclosed mass, velocity dispersion and half-light radius.\nWe extend the calculation to the spherical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) model, and\ndemonstrate that our new formulae give accurate results in comparison to more\nelaborate Jeans models driven by Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Of the known\nultrafaint dwarf spheroidals, we show that Ursa Major II, Reticulum II, Tucana\nII and Horologium I have the largest J-factors and so provide the most\npromising candidates for indirect dark matter detection experiments. Amongst\nthe classical dwarfs, Draco, Sculptor and Ursa Minor have the highest\nJ-factors.

The central and asymptotic behaviour of the\nJ-factor curves are derived as a function of the dark halo properties.

We\naccount for diffusive shock acceleration of CRs at resolved shocks and at\nsupernova remnants in the interstellar medium (ISM), and follow the advective\nCR transport within the magnetised plasma, as well as anisotropic diffusive\ntransport of CRs along the local magnetic field. CR losses are included in\nterms of Coulomb and hadronic interactions with the thermal plasma. We\ndemonstrate the accuracy of our formalism for CR acceleration at shocks through\nsimulations of plane-parallel shock tubes that are compared to newly derived\nexact solutions of the Riemann shock tube problem with CR acceleration. We find\nthat the increased compressibility of the post-shock plasma due to the produced\nCRs decreases the shock speed. However, CR acceleration at spherically\nexpanding blast waves does not significantly break the self-similarity of the\nSedov-Taylor solution; the resulting modifications can be approximated by a\nsuitably adjusted, but constant adiabatic index. In first applications of the\nnew CR formalism to simulations of isolated galaxies and cosmic structure\nformation, we find that CRs add an important pressure component to the ISM that\nincreases the vertical scale height of disk galaxies, and thus reduces the star\nformation rate. Strong external structure formation shocks inject CRs into the\ngas, but the relative pressure of this component decreases towards halo centres\nas adiabatic compression favours the thermal over the CR pressure. \n\n"}

{"id": "1605.00643", "contents": "Title: Galactic winds driven by isotropic and anisotropic cosmic ray diffusion\n  in disk galaxies Abstract: The physics of cosmic rays (CR) is a promising candidate for explaining the\ndriving of galactic winds and outflows. Recent galaxy formation simulations\nhave demonstrated the need for active CR transport either in the form of\ndiffusion or streaming to successfully launch winds in galaxies. However, due\nto computational limitations, most previous simulations have modeled CR\ntransport isotropically. Here, we discuss high resolution simulations of\nisolated disk galaxies in a $10^{11}\\rm{M_\\odot}$ halo with the moving mesh\ncode {\\sc Arepo} that include injection of CRs from supernovae, advective\ntransport, CR cooling, and CR transport through isotropic or anisotropic\ndiffusion. We show that either mode of diffusion leads to the formation of\nstrong bipolar outflows. However, they develop significantly later in the\nsimulation with anisotropic diffusion compared to the simulation with isotropic\ndiffusion. Moreover, we find that isotropic diffusion allows most of the CRs to\nquickly diffuse out of the disk, while in the simulation with anisotropic\ndiffusion, most CRs remain in the disk once the magnetic field becomes\ndominated by its azimuthal component, which occurs after $\\sim 300\\,{\\rm\nMyrs}$. This has important consequences for the gas dynamics in the disk. In\nparticular, we show that isotropic diffusion strongly suppresses the\namplification of the magnetic field in the disk compared to anisotropic or no\ndiffusion models. We therefore conclude that reliable simulations which include\nCR transport inevitably need to account for anisotropic diffusion. \n\n"}

Extragalactic cosmic rays\nshould be isotropic, but galactic cosmic rays of this type should be seen\nmostly along the galactic plane, and there should be a shortage of events\ncoming from directions near the galactic anticenter.

The\nsource, compact at Very Large Array (VLA) resolution, is resolved on the\nmilliarcsec scale, showing a central region plus two extended structures. The\nrelatively high brightness temperature of all components (5x10^6-1.3x10^8 K)\nsupports the hypothesis that the radio emission is non-thermal and likely\nproduced by a relativistic jet and/or small radio lobes. The observed radio\nmorphology, the lack of a significant core and the presence of a low frequency\n(230 MHz) spectral turnover are reminiscent of the Compact Steep Spectrum\nsources (CSS). However, the linear size of the source (~0.5kpc) measured from\nthe EVN map is lower than the value predicted using the turnover/size relation\nvalid for CSS sources (~6kpc).

Through\na systematic statistical study of data taken from October 2006 (from December\n2009 for the case of the 1.3mm observations) to August 2014, we characterise\nthe variability of the total flux density and linear polarisation.

The total flux-density variability at 1.3mm is found, in general, to\nbe faster, and to have larger amplitude and flatter PSD slopes than 3.5mm. The\npolarisation degree is on average larger at 1.3mm than at 3.5mm, by a factor of\n2.6. The variability of linear polarisation degree is faster and has higher\nfractional amplitude than for total flux density, with the typical time scales\nduring prominent polarisation peaks being significantly faster at 1.3mm than at\n3.5mm. The polarisation angle at both 3.5 and 1.3mm is highly variable.

The continuously growing \\cmb data sets render the \\cmb\nmap-making problem more challenging in terms of computational cost and memory\nin particular in the context of ground based experiments.

We develop an embarrassingly parallel implementation\nof the approach where each processor performs a sequential map-making for a\nsubset of the TOD.

The thesis study is\nexpected to reveal salient properties of matter dynamics in affine spacetime\nand may reveal an intimate connection between vacuum state and metrical\ngravity. An interesting application of the framework is the inflationary\nregime, where it is shown that affine gravity prefers only a unique metric\ntensor such that the transition from nonminimal to minimal coupling of the\ninflaton is performed only via redefinition of the latter. This allows us to\navoid the use of the so called conformal frames.

As lower limits on this normalisation, we consider\nthe evolution in stellar mass density, metal mass density, and supernova rate\ndensity, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalisation is much lower than\nindicated by our direct fit. Additionally, predictions from the SFH for\nsupernova type Ia rate densities tentatively suggests delay times of ~3 Gyr.

We take account of quantum fluctuations of all modes, including k =\n0. We identify a ``natural coordinate'' b_0 of the interacting bosons, by which\nmany physical properties can be simply described. Using b_0, we successfully\ndefine the cosine and sine operators for interacting many bosons. The\nwavefunction, which we call the ``number state of interacting bosons'' (NSIB),\nof the ground state that has a definite number N of interacting bosons can be\nrepresented simply as a number state of b_0. We evaluate the time evolution of\nthe reduced density operator \\rho(t) of the bosons in the box with a finite\nleakage flux J, in the early time stage for which Jt << N. It is shown that\n\\rho(t) evolves from a single NSIB at t = 0, into a classical mixture of NSIBs\nof various values of N at t > 0. We define a new state called the\n``number-phase squeezed state of interacting bosons'' (NPIB). It is shown that\n\\rho(t) for t>0 can be rewritten as the phase-randomized mixture (PRM) of\nNPIBs.
