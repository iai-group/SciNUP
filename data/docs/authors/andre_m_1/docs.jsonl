Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach.

We constrain a\nmass-to-'observed' light ratio, M_h/L_band. For narrow-band surveys, L_band is\nsimply related to the intrinsic Ly-alpha luminosity with a survival fraction of\nLy-alpha photons, alpha_esc. The mass-to-'bolometric light', M_h/L_bol, can\nalso be deduced, once the metallicity and stellar mass spectrum are given. The\ninferred M_h/L_bol is more sensitive to metallicity than to the mass spectrum.\nWe find the following constraints on a mass-to-light ratio of Ly-alpha emitters\nfrom 5.7 < z < 7: (M_h/L_bol)(alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma})^{-1}=21-38, 14-26,\nand 9-17 for Z=0, 1/50, and 1 Z_sun, respectively, where epsilon is the 'duty\ncycle' of Ly-alpha emitters, and gamma ~ 2 is a local slope of the cumulative\nluminosity function. Only weak lower limits are obtained for z=8.8. Therefore,\nLy-alpha emitters are consistent with either starburst galaxies M_h/L_bol ~\n0.1-1 with a smaller Ly-alpha survival fraction, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma}\n~0.01-0.05, or normal populations (M_h/L_bol ~ 10) if a good fraction of\nLy-alpha photons survived, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma} ~ 0.5-1. We find no\nevidence for the end of reionization in the luminosity functions of Ly-alpha\nemitters discovered in the current Ly-alpha surveys, including recent discovery\nof one Ly-alpha emitter at z=7. The data are consistent with no evolution of\nintrinsic properties of Ly-alpha emitters or neutral fraction in the\nintergalactic medium up to z=7. No detection of sources at z=8.8 does not yield\na significant constraint yet.

On average, a Milky Way-sized galaxy has 3 subhalos with\nvmax>80km/s; 7 with vmax>60km/s; and 15 with vmax>40km/s merge at redshift z>1.\nAssuming isotropic accretion, a third of these merge at an impact angle <20\ndegrees and are dragged into the disc plane by dynamical friction. Their\naccreted stars and dark matter settle into a thick disc. The stellar thick disc\nqualitatively reproduces the observed thick disc at the solar neighbourhood,\nbut is less massive by a factor ~2-10. The dark matter disc contributes 0.25-1\ntimes the halo density at the solar position. Although not likely to be\ndynamically interesting, the dark disc has important implications for the\ndirect detection of dark matter because of its low velocity with respect to the\nEarth.

Methods: We consider\ncases where the magnetic Reynolds number is either marginal or moderately\nsupercritical with respect to small-scale dynamo action in the absence of shear\nand rotation. The effects of magnetic helicity fluxes are studied by comparing\nresults for the magnetic field with open and closed boundaries. Results:\nWithout shear no large-scale dynamos are found even if the ingredients\nnecessary for the alpha-effect (rotation and stratification) are present in the\nsystem. When uniform horizontal shear is added, a large-scale magnetic field\ndevelops, provided the boundaries are open. In this case the mean magnetic\nfield contains a significant fraction of the total field. For those runs where\nthe magnetic Reynolds number is between 60 and 250, small-scale dynamo is\nexpected to be excited, but the field distribution is found to be similar to\ncases with smaller magnetic Reynolds number where the small-scale dynamo is not\nexcited. In the case of closed (perfectly conducting) boundaries, magnetic\nhelicity fluxes are suppressed and no large-scale fields are found. Similarly,\npoor large-scale field development is seen when vertical shear is used in\ncombination with periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions. If,\nhowever, open (normal-field) boundary conditions are used in the x-direction, a\nlarge-scale field develops. These results support the notion that shear not\nonly helps to generate the field, but it also plays a crucial role in driving\nmagnetic helicity fluxes out of the system along the isocontours of shear,\nthereby allowing efficient dynamo action. \n\n"}

Developments in observations, theory, and instrumentation have\nprepared the way so that the next decade can be the one in which we finally\nanswer the question, \"What are gamma-ray bursts?\" This question encompasses not\nonly what the progenitors are that produce the GRBs, but also how the enormous\nluminosity of the GRBs, concentrated in gamma rays, is achieved. Observations\nacross the electromagnetic spectrum, from both the ground and space, will be\nrequired to fully tackle this important question. This white paper, mostly\ndistilled from a recent study commissioned by the Division of Astrophysics of\nthe American Physical Society, focuses on what very high energy (~100 GeV and\nabove) gamma-ray observations can contribute. Very high energy gamma rays probe\nthe most extreme high energy particle populations in the burst environment,\ntesting models of lepton and proton acceleration in GRBs and constraining the\nbulk Lorentz factor and opacity of the outflow. Sensitivity improvements of\nmore than an order of magnitude in the very high energy gamma-ray band can be\nachieved early in the next decade, in order to contribute to this science. \n\n"}

The material accreted from\nthese satellites forms a dark matter disc that contributes 0.25 - 1.5 times the\nnon-rotating halo density at the solar position. Here, we show the importance\nof the dark disc for indirect dark matter detection in neutrino telescopes.\nPrevious predictions of the neutrino flux from WIMP annihilation in the Earth\nand the Sun have assumed that Galactic dark matter is spherically distributed\nwith a Gaussian velocity distribution, the standard halo model. Although the\ndark disc has a local density comparable to the dark halo, its higher phase\nspace density at low velocities greatly enhances capture rates in the Sun and\nEarth. For typical dark disc properties, the resulting muon flux from the Earth\nis increased by three orders of magnitude over the SHM, while for the Sun the\nincrease is an order of magnitude. This significantly increases the sensitivity\nof neutrino telescopes to fix or constrain parameters in WIMP models. The flux\nfrom the Earth is extremely sensitive to the detailed properties of the dark\ndisc, while the flux from the Sun is more robust. The enhancement of the muon\nflux from the dark disc puts the search for WIMP annihilation in the Earth on\nthe same level as the Sun for WIMP masses < 100 GeV. \n\n"}

In addition to the boost\nto the dark matter annihilation cross section from the high densities of these\nsubhalos with respect to the main halo, an additional boost caused by the\nSommerfeld enhancement results from the fact that they are kinematically colder\nthan the Galactic halo. If we further believe the generic prediction of CDM\nthat in each subhalo there is an abundance of substructure which is\napproximately self-similar to that of the Galactic halo, then I show that\nadditional boosts coming from the density enhancements of these small\nsubstructures and their small velocity dispersions enhance the dark matter\nannihilation cross section even further. I find that very large boost factors\n($10^5$ to $10^9$) are obtained in a large class of models. The implications of\nthese boost factors for the detection of dark matter annihilation from dwarf\nSpheroidal galaxies in the Galactic halo are such that, generically, they\noutshine the background gamma-ray flux and are detectable by the Fermi\nGamma-ray Space Telescope. \n\n"}

GCs\nare therefore expected to host large numbers of MSPs. This is also confirmed\nobservationally. The MSPs continuously inject relativistic electrons into the\nambient region beyond their light cylinders, and these relativistic particles\nproduce unpulsed radiation via the synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC)\nprocesses. It is thus possible, in the context of General Relativistic (GR)\nframe-dragging MSP models, to predict unpulsed very high energy radiation\nexpected from nearby GCs. We use a period-derivative cleaned sample of MSPs in\n47 Tucanae, where the effects of the cluster potential on the individual period\nderivatives have been removed. Using a Monte Carlo process to include effects\nof pulsar geometry, we obtain average injection spectra (with relatively small\nerrors) of particles leaving the MSPs. These spectra are next used to predict\ncumulative synchrotron and IC spectra expected from 47 Tucanae, which is a\nlower limit, as no reacceleration is assumed. We find that the IC radiation\nfrom 47 Tucanae may be visible for H.E.S.S., depending on the nebular field B\nas well as the number of MSPs N in the GC.

In this work we show that the lack of\ndetection of a GeV spectrum excess in almost all GRBs, though somewhat\nsurprisingly, can be well understood within the standard internal shock model\nand several alternatives like the photosphere-internal shock (gradual magnetic\ndissipation) model and the magnetized internal shock model.

The theory of\ngravitational aether is an alternative to general relativity that does not\nsuffer from this fine-tuning problem, as it decouples the quantum field theory\nvacuum from geometry, while remaining consistent with other tests of gravity.\nIn this paper, we study static black hole solutions in this theory and show\nthat it manifests a UV-IR coupling: Aether couples the spacetime metric close\nto the black hole horizon, to metric at infinity. We then show that using the\nTrans-Planckian ansatz (as a quantum gravity effect) close to the black hole\nhorizon, leads to an accelerating cosmological solution, far from the horizon.\nInterestingly, this acceleration matches current observations for stellar mass\nblack holes.

We find relations among spectral parameters of the IC radiation in\nboth the Thomson (for Low energy BL Lacs) and the Klein-Nishina regimes (mainly\nfor High energy BL Lacs) and we compute how variability is driven by a smooth\nincrease of key source parameters, primarily the root mean square electron\nenergy. The single component SSC source model in the Thomson regime turns out\nto be adequate for many LBL sources. However, the simple model meets its limits\nwith the fast/strong flares recently reported for a few sources in the TeV\nrange; these require sudden accelerations of emitting electrons in a second\nsource component. \n\n"}

We\ndevelop in this paper a procedure, based on the autocorrelation of the seismic\nFourier spectrum.

Similarly, the QPO frequency varies with the source count rate (S).\nHence, the significance of a QPO, scaling as S x Rs^2/W^(1/2) will also depend\non frequency. In addition, the significance also scales up with the square root\nof the integration time of the Fourier power density spectrum (T).\nConsequently, depending on the way data are considered, kHz QPOs may be\ndetected only over a limited range of their frequency spans or detected\npredominantly at some frequencies, leading potentially to biases in the\nobserved distributions of frequencies or frequency ratios. Although subject of\nmuch controversy, an observed clustering of QPO frequency ratios around 3/2 in\nSco X-1, also seen in other sources, has been previously used as an argument\nsupporting resonance based models of neutron star QPOs. In this paper, we\nmeasure how the statistical significance of both kHz QPOs vary with frequency\nfor three prototype neutron star kHz QPO sources, namely 4U1636-536, 4U0614+091\nand Sco X-1. As the significance of QPO detection depends on frequency, we show\nthat in sensitivity-limited observations (as in the case of the RXTE/PCA), a\nsimultaneous detection of both the lower and upper kHz QPOs can only be\nachieved over limited frequency ranges. As a result, even a uniform\ndistribution of QPO frequencies will lead to peaks (in particular around 3/2)\nin the histogram of frequency ratios. This implies that the observed clustering\nof ratios does not provide any evidence for intrinsically preferred frequency\nratios, thus weakening the case for a resonance mechanism at the origin of\nneutron star kHz QPOs. \n\n"}

We examine the properties of these\nBH-BH binaries through direct N-body simulations of star clusters using the\nGPU-enabled NBODY6 code. We perform simulations of N <= 10^5 Plummer clusters\nof low-mass stars with an initial population of BHs. Additionally, we do\nseveral calculations of star clusters confined within a reflective boundary\nmimicking only the core of a massive cluster. We find that stellar-mass BHs\nwith masses ~ 10 solar mass segregate rapidly into the cluster core and form a\nsub-cluster of BHs within typically 0.2 - 0.5 pc radius, which is dense enough\nto form BH-BH binaries through 3-body encounters. While most BH binaries are\nejected from the cluster by recoils received during super-elastic encounters\nwith the single BHs, few of them harden sufficiently so that they can merge via\nGW emission within the cluster. We find that for clusters with $N \\ga 5\\times\n10^4$, typically 1 - 2 BH-BH mergers occur within them during the first ~ 4 Gyr\nof evolution. Also for each of these clusters, there are a few escaping BH\nbinaries that can merge within a Hubble time, most of the merger times being\nwithin a few Gyr. These results indicate that intermediate-age massive clusters\nconstitute the most important class of candidates for producing dynamical BH-BH\nmergers. Old globular clusters cannot contribute significantly to the\npresent-day BH-BH merger rate since most of the mergers from them would have\noccurred earlier.

Abstract: The internal-plateau X-ray emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) indicates that\na newly born magnetar could be the central object of some GRBs. The observed\nluminosity and duration of the plateaus suggest that, for such a magnetar, a\nrapid spin with a sub- or millisecond period is sometimes able to last\nthousands of seconds. In this case, the conventional neutron star (NS) model\nfor the magnetar may be challenged, since the rapid spin of nascent NSs would\nbe remarkably decelerated within hundreds of seconds due to r-mode instability.\nIn contrast, the r-modes can be effectively suppressed in nascent strange stars\n(SSs).

The main role of\nthe BH-disc magnetic connection is to provide the source of energy for the jets\nwhen the mass accretion rate is very low. We assume that the jets are launched\nfrom the disc inside the BH ergosphere, where the rotational effects of the\nspace-time become much stronger, being further accelerated by magnetic\nprocesses. The rotation of the space-time channels a fraction of the disc\nenergy (i.e., the gravitational energy of the disc plus the rotational energy\nof the BH which is deposited into the disc by magnetic connection) into a\npopulation of particles that escape from the disc surfaces, carrying away mass,\nenergy and angular momentum in the form of jets, allowing the remaining disc\ngas to accrete. In the limit of the spin-down power regime, the model proposed\nhere can be regarded as a variant of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, where the\nBH rotational energy is transferred to the disc inside the ergosphere and then\nused to drive the jets. We use general-relativistic conservation laws to\ncalculate the mass flow rate into the jets, the launching power of the jets and\nthe angular momentum transported by the jets for BHs with a spin parameter $a_*\n\\geqslant 0.95$.

This new tool allows us to build an observable host\ngalaxy catalogue which is required to reproduce the current stellar mass\ndistribution of observed hosts. This observability pipeline predicts that the\nminimum mass for the progenitor stars should be ~75 solar masses in order to be\nable to reproduce BATSE observations. Systems in our observable catalogue are\nable to reproduce the observed properties of host galaxies, namely stellar\nmasses, colours, luminosity, star formation activity and metallicities as a\nfunction of redshift. At z>2, our model predicts that the observable host\ngalaxies would be very similar to the global galaxy population. We found that\n~88 per cent of the observable host galaxies with mean gas metallicity lower\nthan 0.6 solar have stellar masses in the range 10^8.5-10^10.3 solar masses in\nexcellent agreement with observations. Interestingly, in our model observable\nhost galaxies remain mainly within this mass range regardless of redshift,\nsince lower stellar mass systems would have a low probability of being observed\nwhile more massive ones would be too metal-rich. Observable host galaxies are\npredicted to preferentially inhabit dark matter haloes in the range\n10^11-10^11.5 solar masses, with a weak dependence on redshift. \n\n"}

In particular, we consider the possibility that the rise\nin the positron fraction observed by the PAMELA satellite is due to the\nproduction through (hadronic) cosmic ray spallation and subsequent acceleration\nof positrons, in the same sources as the primary cosmic rays. We present a new\nanalytical estimate of the range of possible fluctuations in the high energy\nelectron flux due to the discreteness of plausible cosmic ray sources. Fitting\nour result for the total electron-positron flux measured by the Fermi satellite\nallows us to fix the only free parameter of the model and make an independent\nprediction for the positron fraction.

It is timely to\nreinvestigate how it is calculated and to assess the various uncertainties\nwhich are likely to affect the accuracy of the predictions. The Galactic\ngamma-ray diffuse emission is mostly produced above a few GeV by the\ninteractions of cosmic ray primaries impinging on the interstellar material.\nThe theoretical error on that component is derived by exploring various\npotential sources of uncertainty. Particular attention is paid to cosmic ray\npropagation. Nuclear cross sections, the proton and helium fluxes at the Earth,\nthe Galactic radial profile of supernova remnants and the hydrogen distribution\ncan also severely affect the signal. The propagation of cosmic ray species\nthroughout the Galaxy is described in the framework of a semi-analytic two-zone\ndiffusion/convection model. This allows to convert the constraints set by the\nboron-to-carbon data into a theoretical uncertainty on the diffuse emission.\nNew deconvolutions of the HI and CO sky maps are also used to get the hydrogen\ndistribution within the Galaxy.

The uncertainties related to nuclear cross sections\nand to the primary cosmic ray fluxes at the Earth are significant.

The term environment has been used to\ndescribe a wide variety of measures that may or may not correlate with each\nother. Popular measures of environment include the distance to the N'th nearest\nneighbour, the number density of objects within some distance, or the mass of\nthe host dark matter halo. We use results from the Millennium simulation and a\nsemi-analytic model for galaxy formation to quantify the relations between\nenvironment and halo mass. We show that the environmental parameters used in\nthe observational literature are in effect measures of halo mass, even if they\nare measured for a fixed stellar mass. The strongest correlation between\nenvironment and halo mass arises when the number of objects is counted out to a\ndistance of 1.5-2 times the virial radius of the host halo and when the\ngalaxies/haloes are required to be relatively bright/massive. For observational\nstudies the virial radius is not easily determined, but the number of\nneighbours out to 1-2 Mpc/h gives a similarly strong correlation. For the\ndistance to the N'th nearest neighbour the correlation with halo mass is nearly\nas strong provided N>2. We demonstrate that this environmental parameter\nbecomes insensitive to halo mass if it is constructed from dimensionless\nquantities. This can be achieved by scaling the minimum luminosity/mass of\nneighbours to that of the object in question and by dividing the distance to a\nlength scale associated with either the neighbour or the galaxy under\nconsideration. We show how such a halo mass independent environmental parameter\ncan be defined for observational and numerical studies. The results presented\nhere will help future studies to disentangle the effects of halo mass and\nexternal environment on the properties of galaxies and dark matter haloes. \n\n"}

In Broderick et al.\n(2011, Paper I of this three paper series), we argued that instead powerful\nplasma instabilities in the ultra-relativistic pair beam dissipate the kinetic\nenergy of the TeV-generated pairs locally, heating the intergalactic medium\n(IGM). Here, we explore the effect of this heating upon the thermal history of\nthe IGM. We collate the observed extragalactic VHEGR sources to determine a\nlocal VHEGR heating rate and correct for the pointed nature of VHEGR\nobservations using Fermi observations of high and intermediate peaked BL Lacs.\nBecause the local extragalactic VHEGR flux is dominated by TeV blazars, we tie\nthe TeV blazar luminosity density to the quasar luminosity density, and produce\na VHEGR heating rate as a function of redshift. This heating is relatively\nhomogeneous for z<~4 with increasing spatial variation at higher redshift\n(order unity at z~6).

The observed shape of the\nreflection line is formed by integrating contributions over a range of radii\nacross the accretion disc plane, where the individual photons experience\ndifferent level of energy shifts, boosting, and amplification by relativistic\neffects. These have to be convolved with the intrinsic emissivity of the line,\nwhich is a function of radius and the emission angle in the local frame. We\nstudy if the currently discussed instruments on-board X-ray satellites will be\nable to reveal the departure of the line radial emissivity from a simple smooth\npower-law function, which is often assumed in data fitting and interpretation.\nSuch a departure can be a result of excess emission occurring at a certain\ndistance.

To explain\nthe two-peaks in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the nucleus of M87\nwhich is similar to those of blazars, the most commonly adopted models are the\nsynchrotron self-Compton scattering (SSC) models and the external inverse\nCompton scattering (EIC) models. Considering that there is no correlated\nvariation in the soft band (from radio to X-ray) matching the TeV variation,\nand the TeV sources should not suffer from the gamma-gamma absorption due to\nthe flat TeV spectrum, the EIC models are advantageous in modeling the TeV\nemission from M87. In this paper, we propose a self-consistent EIC model to\nexplain the flat TeV spectrum of M87 within the framework of fully general\nrelativity, where the background soft photons are from the advection-dominated\naccretion flow (ADAF) around the central black hole, and the high energy\nelectrons are from the mini-jets which are powered by the magnetic reconnection\nin the main jet (Giannios et al. 2010). In our model, both the TeV flares\nobserved in the years of 2005 and 2008 could be well explained: the gamma-gamma\nabsorption for TeV photons is very low, even inside the region very close to\nthe black hole 20Rg~50Rg; at the same region, the average EIC cooling time (~\n10^2-10^3s) is short, which is consistent with the observed time scale of TeV\nvariation. Furthermore, we also discuss the possibility that the accompanying\nX-ray flare in 2008 is due to the direct synchrotron radiation of the\nmini-jets. \n\n"}

This\neffect is able to explain both the value of the polarization and the position\nangle. We estimate the required magnetic field in the broad line region by\nusing simple asymptotic analytical formulas for Milne's problem in magnetized\natmosphere, which take into account the last scattering of radiation before\nescaping from the accretion disc. The polarization of a broad spectral line\nescaping from disc is described by the same mechanism. The characteristic\nfeatures of polarization of a broad line is the minimum of the degree of\npolarization in the center of the line and continuous rotation of the position\nangle from one wing to another. These effects can be explained by existence of\nclouds in the left (velocity is directed to an observer) and the right\n(velocity is directed from an observer) parts of the orbit in a rotating\nkeplerian magnetized accretion disc.

Lyman-alpha emitters Abstract: We report the results of a spectroscopic search for Lyman-alpha emission from\ngamma-ray burst host galaxies. Based on the well-defined TOUGH sample of 69\nX-ray selected Swift GRBs, we have targeted the hosts of a subsample of 20 GRBs\nknown from afterglow spectroscopy to be in the redshift range 1.8-4.5. We\ndetect Lya emission from 7 out of the 20 hosts, with the typical limiting\n3sigma line flux being 8E-18 erg/cm2/s, corresponding to a Lya luminosity of\n6E41 erg/s at z=3. The Lya luminosities for the 7 hosts in which we detect Lya\nemission are in the range (0.6-2.3)E42 erg/s corresponding to star-formation\nrates of 0.6-2.1 Msun/yr (not corrected for extinction). The rest-frame Lya\nequivalent widths (EWs) for the 7 hosts are in the range 9-40A. For 6 of the 13\nhosts for which Lya is not detected we place fairly strong 3sigma upper limits\non the EW (<20A), while for others the EW is either unconstrained or has a less\nconstraining upper limit. We find that the distribution of Lya EWs is\ninconsistent with being drawn from the Lya EW distribution of bright Lyman\nbreak galaxies at the 98.3% level, in the sense that the TOUGH hosts on average\nhave larger EWs than bright LBGs. We can exclude an early indication, based on\na smaller, heterogeneous sample of pre-Swift GRB hosts, that all GRB hosts are\nLya emitters. We find that the TOUGH hosts on average have lower EWs than the\npre-Swift GRB hosts, but the two samples are only inconsistent at the 92%\nlevel. The velocity centroid of the Lya line is redshifted by 200-700 km/s with\nrespect to the systemic velocity, similar to what is seen for LBGs, possibly\nindicating star-formation driven outflows from the host galaxies. There seems\nto be a trend between the Lya EW and the optical to X-ray spectral index of the\nafterglow (beta_OX), hinting that dust plays a role in the observed strength\nand even presence of Lya emission.

Using the wealth of the presently available data and an\nimproved averaging method, we obtain energy-dependent folded and averaged light\ncurves with unprecedented accuracy. We find that above ~5 keV, the modulation\ndepth decreases with the increasing energy, which is consistent with the\nmodulation being caused by both bound-free absorption and Compton scattering in\nthe stellar wind of the donor, with minima corresponding to the highest optical\ndepth, which occurs around the superior conjunction. We find a decrease of the\ndepth below ~3 keV, which appears to be due to re-emission of the absorbed\ncontinuum by the wind in soft X-ray lines. Based on the shape of the folded\nlight curves, any X-ray contribution from the jet in Cyg X-3, which emits\ngamma-rays detected at energies >0.1 GeV in soft spectral states, is found to\nbe minor up to ~100 keV.

Changes in its\nradio morphology suggested in the past the hypothesis of a precessing\nmicroquasar. In 2006, a set of VLBA observations performed all around the orbit\nwere not used to study the precession because the souce was explained in the\ncontext of the pulsar model, the alternative model for this system.

At the light of these results we reanalysed\nthe set of VLBA observations that constitutes a unique tool to determine the\nprecession period and render a better understanding of the physical mechanism\nbehind the precession. We improved the dynamic range of the images by a factor\nof four using self-calibration, and the self-calibrated maps reveal, in six out\nof ten images, a double-sided structure. The double-sided structure has\nvariable position angle and switches at some epochs to a one-sided structure.\nThese variations indicate a scenario where the precessing jet, inducing\nvariable Doppler boosting, points close to our line of sight - a microblazar,\nthe galactic version of the extra-galactic blazars.

We develop a multilevel\nBayesian framework for assessing association of UHECRs and candidate source\npopulations, and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for estimating model\nparameters and comparing models by computing, via Chib's method, marginal\nlikelihoods and Bayes factors. We demonstrate the framework by analyzing\nmeasurements of 69 UHECRs observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) from\n2004-2009, using a volume-complete catalog of 17 local active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) out to 15 megaparsecs as candidate sources. An early portion of the data\n(\"period 1,\" with 14 events) was used by PAO to set an energy cut maximizing\nthe anisotropy in period 1; the 69 measurements include this \"tuned\" subset,\nand subsequent \"untuned\" events with energies above the same cutoff. Also,\nmeasurement errors are approximately summarized. These factors are problematic\nfor independent analyses of PAO data. Within the context of \"standard candle\"\nsource models (i.e., with a common isotropic emission rate), and considering\nonly the 55 untuned events, there is no significant evidence favoring\nassociation of UHECRs with local AGN vs. an isotropic background. The\nhighest-probability associations are with the two nearest, adjacent AGN,\nCentaurus A and NGC 4945.

Given recent evidence of similar gamma-ray lines from the Inner\nGalaxy, it is tempting to interpret these unassociated sources as nearby dark\nmatter subhalos, powered by ongoing annihilations.

Compact stars can\nhave such exotic states up to their surface (called strange stars (SS)) or they\ncan have quark core surrounded by hadronic matter, known as hybrid stars (HS).\nAs the state of matter of the resultant SS/HS is different from the initial\nhadronic matter, their masses also differ. Therefore, such conversion leads to\nhuge energy release, sometimes of the order of $10^{53}$ ergs. In the present\nwork we study the qualitative energy released by such conversion. Recent\nobservations reveal huge surface magnetic field in certain stars, termed\nmagnetars. Such huge magnetic fields can modify the equations of state (EOS) of\nthe matter describing the star. Therefore, the mass of magnetars are different\nfrom normal NS. The energy released during the conversion process from neutron\nmagnetar (NM) to strange magnetar/hybrid magnetar (SS/HS) is different from\nnormal NS to SS/HS conversion. In this work we calculate the energy release\nduring the phase transition in magnetars. The energy released during NS to\nSS/HS conversion exceeds the energy released during NM to SM/HM conversion. The\nenergy released during the conversion of NS to SS is always of the order of\n$10^{53}$ ergs. The amount of energy released during such conversion can only\nbe compared to the energy observed during the gamma ray bursts (GRB). The\nenergy liberated during NM to HM conversion is few times lesser, and is not\nlikely to power GRB at cosmological distances. However, the magnetars are more\nlikely to lose their energy from the magnetic poles and can produce giant\nflares, which are usually associated with magnetars. \n\n"}

The variability originates in\nthe disc as mass-accretion fluctuations and propagates through the disc to\n'light up' inner disc regions, eventually modulating the power-law emission\nthat is produced relatively centrally.\n  We present a comparative spectral-timing study of XMM-Newton data from the\nBHXRB SWIFT J1753.5-0127 in a bright 2009 hard state with that from the\nsignificantly fainter 2006 hard state, to show for the first time the change in\ndisc spectral-timing properties associated with a global increase in both the\naccretion rate and the relative contribution of the disc emission to the\nbolometric luminosity.\n  We show that, although there is strong evidence for intrinsic disc\nvariability in the more luminous hard state, the disc variability amplitude is\nsuppressed relative to that of the power-law emission, which contrasts with the\nbehaviour at lower luminosities where the disc variability is slightly enhanced\nwhen compared with the power-law variations. In the higher-luminosity data, the\ndisc variability below 0.6 keV becomes incoherent with the power-law and\nhigher-energy disc emission at frequencies below 0.5 Hz, in contrast with the\ncoherent variations seen in the 2006 data.\n  We explain these differences and the associated complex lags in the 2009 data\nin terms of the fluctuating disc model. If the variable signals are generated\nat small radii in the disc, the variability of disc emission can be naturally\nsuppressed by the fraction of unmodulated disc emission from larger radii. The\ndrop in coherence can be produced by disc accretion fluctuations arising at\nlarger radii which are viscously damped and hence unable to propagate to the\ninner, power-law emitting region. \n\n"}

An\nexplanation might be the oscillation of VHE photons into hypothetical\naxion-like particles (ALPs) in ambient magnetic fields. This mechanism would\ndecrease the opacity as ALPs propagate unimpeded over cosmological distances.\n  Here, a large sample of VHE gamma-ray spectra obtained with imaging air\nCherenkov telescopes is used to set, for the first time, lower limits on the\nphoton-ALP coupling constant over a large range of ALP masses. The conversion\nin different magnetic field configurations, including intra-cluster and\nintergalactic magnetic fields together with the magnetic field of the Milky\nWay, is investigated taking into account the energy dependence of the\noscillations. For optimistic scenarios of the intervening magnetic fields, a\nlower limit on the photon-ALP coupling of the order of\n$10^{-12}\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ is obtained whereas more conservative model\nassumptions result in $2\\times10^{-11}\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$.

Here we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lower\nradio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts could\nbe detectable at redshifts out to about $z=0.5$ in surveys below 1 GHz. Using a\nsource model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometric\nluminosities $\\sim 8 \\times 10^{44}$ ergs/s uniformly distributed per unit\ncomoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density as\na function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found by\nThornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate and\nredshift probed by a given survey.

The radio jet of OJ287 has\nbeen observed for a shorter time of about 30 years. It has a complicated\nstructure that varies dramatically in a few years time scale. Aims.

We calculate the effect of the\nsecondary black hole on the inner edge of the accretion disk of the primary\nusing particle simulations.

Determining the nature of their progenitors is a crucial step\ntowards understanding the properties of SNe. Until recently, no progenitor has\nbeen directly detected for SN of type Ibc, which are believed to come from\nmassive stars that lose their hydrogen envelope through stellar winds and from\nbinary systems where the companion has stripped the H envelope from the\nprimary. Here we analyze recently reported observations of iPTF13bvn, which\ncould possibly be the first detection of a SN Ib progenitor based on\npre-explosion images. Very interestingly, the recently published Geneva models\nof single stars can reproduce the observed photometry of the progenitor\ncandidate and its mass-loss rate, confirming a recently proposed scenario. We\nfind that a single WR star with initial mass in the range 31-35 Msun fits the\nobserved photometry of the progenitor of iPTF13bvn. The progenitor likely has a\nluminosity of log (L/Lsun)~5.55, surface temperature ~45000 K, and mass of\n~10.9 Msun at the time of explosion. Our non-rotating 32 Msun model\noverestimates the derived radius of the progenitor, although this could likely\nbe reconciled with a fine-tuned model of a more massive (between 40 and 50\nMsun), hotter, and luminous progenitor. Our models indicate a very uncertain\nejecta mass of ~8 Msun, which is higher than the average of the SN Ib ejecta\nmass that is derived from the lightcurve (2-4 Msun). This possibly high ejecta\nmass could produce detectable effects in the iPTF13bvn lightcurve and spectrum.\nIf the candidate is indeed confirmed to be the progenitor, our results suggest\nthat stars with relatively high initial masses (>30 Msun) can produce visible\nSN explosions at their deaths and do not collapse directly to a black hole. \n\n"}

In this paper, we study binary-single\nstellar scatterings occurring in dense stellar systems as a source of\neccentrically-inspiraling binaries. Many interactions between compact binaries\nand single objects are characterized by chaotic resonances in which the\nbinary-single system undergoes many exchanges before reaching a final state.\nDuring these chaotic resonances, a pair of objects has a non-negligible\nprobability of experiencing a very close passage. Significant orbital energy\nand angular momentum are carried away from the system by gravitational wave\n(GW) radiation in these close passages and in some cases this implies an\ninspiral time shorter than the orbital period of the bound third body. We\nderive the cross section for such dynamical inspiral outcomes through\nanalytical arguments and through numerical scattering experiments including GW\nlosses. We show that the cross section for dynamical inspirals grows with\nincreasing target binary semi-major axis, $a$, and that for equal-mass binaries\nit scales as $a^{2/7}$. Thus, we expect wide target binaries to predominantly\ncontribute to the production of these relativistic outcomes. We estimate that\neccentric inspirals account for approximately one percent of dynamically\nassembled non-eccentric merging binaries.

The\nbispectrum measures two key nonlinear properties of a time series -- its\nreversability in time, and the symmetry about the mean of its flux distribution\n-- for triplets of frequencies. Like other Fourier methods, it is especially\nvaluable for working with time series which contain large numbers of cycles at\nthe period of interest, but in which the signal-to-noise at a given frequency\nis small in any individual cycle, either because of measurement errors, or\nbecause of the contributions from signals at other frequencies.

This result is achieved through a new method for\nmeasuring the product of the jet Lorentz factor and the intrinsic opening angle\nGamma*theta_j from measured apparent opening angles in flux density limited\nsamples of AGN jets. The Gamma*theta_j parameter is important for jet physics\nbecause it is related to the jet-frame sidewise expansion speed and causal\nconnection between the jet edges and its symmetry axis. Most importantly, the\nstandard model of jet production requires that the jet be causally connected\nwith its symmetry axis, implying that Gamma*theta_j < 1. When we apply our\nmethod to the MOJAVE flux density limited sample of radio loud objects, we find\nGamma*theta_j = 0.2, implying that AGN jets are causally connected. We also\nfind evidence that AGN jets viewed very close to the line of sight effectively\nhave smaller intrinsic opening angles compared with jets viewed more off-axis,\nwhich is consistent with Doppler beaming and a fast inner spine/slow outer\nsheath velocity field. Notably, gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets have a typical\nGamma*theta_j that is two orders of magnitude higher, suggesting that different\nphysical mechanisms are at work in GRB jets compared to AGN jets.

The most\npowerful blazars show clear evidence of the emission from their disks, and this\nhas revived methods of finding the black hole mass and accretion rate by\nmodelling a disk spectrum to the data.

In this article we consider the case of arbitrary\nfields or matter described by an unspecified, general energy-momentum tensor\n$T_{\\mu \\nu}$ and show that the necessary and sufficient condition for\nextraction of a black hole's rotational energy is analogous to that in the\nmechanical Penrose process: absorption of negative energy and negative angular\nmomentum.

Herschel observations indicate that the quasar host is a\nhyperluminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG) with a total infrared luminosity of\nlog10(LIR/L0)=13.90+/-0.02. A greybody fit gives a dust temperature of\nTd=60+/-3K assuming an emissivity index of beta=1.5, considerably higher than\nin submillimeter bright galaxies observed at similar redshifts.

We investigate\nhow robust limits are against astro-physical uncertainties. We study the effect\nof the velocity distribution of dark matter in our Galaxy on capture rates in\nthe Sun.

However, GW sky\nlocalization is relatively poor, with expected localization areas of ~10--100\nsquare degrees; this presents a challenge for following up GW signals from\ncompact binary mergers. Prioritizing wide-field follow-ups based on the\nprobability of successful imaging is important when it is impossible to tile\nthe entire gravitational-wave localization region.\n  Galaxy catalogs were effective at narrowing down regions of the sky to search\nin initial attempts at joint GW/EM observations. The next generation of GW\ndetectors will have a ten-fold increase in range thereby increasing the\nexpected number of galaxies per unit solid angle a thousand-fold.

In\ncontrast, the spectrum of secondary positrons produced through the collisions\nof cosmic rays in the interstellar medium is predicted to fall rapidly with\nenergy, and thus is unable to account for the observed rise. It has been\nproposed, however, that secondary positrons could be produced and then\naccelerated in nearby supernova remnants, potentially explaining the observed\nrise, without the need of primary positron sources. Yet, if secondary positrons\nare accelerated in such shocks, other secondary cosmic ray species (such as\nboron nuclei, and antiprotons) will also be accelerated, leading to rises in\nthe boron-to-carbon and antiproton-to-proton ratios.

This pressure is essentially controlled by the nuclear symmetry\nenergy parameters $S_v$ and $L$, the first two coefficients of a Taylor\nexpansion of the symmetry energy around $n_s$. We discuss constraints on these\nparameters that can be found from nuclear experiments. We demonstrate that\nthese constraints are largely model-independent by deriving them qualitatively\nfrom a simple nuclear model. We also summarize how recent theoretical studies\nof pure neutron matter can reinforce these constraints.

The comparison of the\nobserved fraction of converted photon events to the expected one allows the\ndetermination of the absolute energy scale of the observed photon air showers\nand, thus, an energy calibration of the air shower experiment.

For\nmany MSPs the scattering delay above 1 GHz is at the limit of detectability;\ntherefore, we study it at lower frequencies. Using the LOFAR (LOw-Frequency\nARray) radio telescope we have analyzed short (5-20 min) observations of three\nMSPs in order to estimate the scattering delay at 110-190 MHz, where the number\nof scintles is large and, hence, the statistical uncertainty in the scattering\ndelay is small. We used cyclic spectroscopy, still relatively novel in radio\nastronomy, on baseband-sampled data to achieve unprecedented frequency\nresolution while retaining adequate pulse phase resolution. We detected\nscintillation structure in the spectra of the MSPs PSR B1257+12, PSR\nJ1810+1744, and PSR J2317+1439 with diffractive bandwidths of $6\\pm 3$, $2.0\\pm\n0.3$, and $\\sim 7$ kHz, respectively, where the estimate for PSR J2317+1439 is\nreliable to about a factor of 2.

I: Stellar mass at z<1 Abstract: LGRBs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to star\nformation. The conditions necessary to produce LGRBs can affect the relation\nbetween the LGRB rate and star formation. By using the power of a complete LGRB\nsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,\nwhat is its origin. In this first paper, we build the SED of the z<1 host\ngalaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample, and determine their stellar masses from SED\nfitting. We compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) with\nstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA); (ii) with\nsemi-analitical models of the z<1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) with\nnumerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for\nthe progenitor star environment. We find that at z<1 LGRBs tend to avoid\nmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forming\ngalaxies. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with\nthat of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted for their SFR. This\nimplies that, at least at z<1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star\nformation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-end\nof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow SFR-Mass relation for\nthe low mass galaxy population. GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to\nreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order\nof Z_th=0.3-0.5Z_sun is necessary. Models without a metallicity threshold or\nwith an extreme threshold of Z_th = 0.1Z_sun are excluded at z<1. The use of\nthe BAT6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biases\nwhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. The\npreference for low metallicities (Z<~0.5Z_sun) can be a consequence of the\nparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a GRB.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

Abstract: Measurements of the cosmic ray antiproton spectrum can be used to search for\ncontributions from annihilating dark matter and to constrain the dark matter\nannihilation cross section. Depending on the assumptions made regarding cosmic\nray propagation in the Galaxy, such constraints can be quite stringent. We\nrevisit this topic, utilizing a set of propagation models fit to the cosmic ray\nboron, carbon, oxygen and beryllium data. We derive upper limits on the dark\nmatter annihilation cross section and find that when the cosmic ray propagation\nparameters are treated as nuisance parameters (as we argue is appropriate), the\nresulting limits are significantly less stringent than have been previously\nreported. We also note (as have several previous groups) that simple\nGALPROP-like diffusion-reacceleration models predict a spectrum of cosmic ray\nantiprotons that is in good agreement with PAMELA's observations above ~5 GeV,\nbut that significantly underpredict the flux at lower energies.

Four fields have been monitored\nwith cadences between 15 minutes and several months. A total of 151 images were\nobtained, giving a total survey area of 2275 deg$^2$. We analysed our data\nusing standard LOFAR tools and searched for radio transients using the LOFAR\nTransients Pipeline (TraP). No credible radio transient candidate has been\ndetected; however, we are able to set upper limits on the surface density of\nradio transient sources at low radio frequencies. We also show that\nlow-frequency radio surveys are more sensitive to steep-spectrum coherent\ntransient sources than GHz radio surveys. We used two new statistical methods\nto determine the upper limits on the transient surface density. One is free of\nassumptions on the flux distribution of the sources, while the other assumes a\npower-law distribution in flux and sets more stringent constraints on the\ntransient surface density. Both of these methods provide better constraints\nthan the approach used in previous works.

Follow-up observations, triggered by GW events, of kilonovae\nare nevertheless difficult due to poor localization by GW detectors and due to\ntheir faint near-infrared peak emission that has limited observational\ncapability. We show that the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on the James Webb\nSpace Telescope (JWST) will be able to detect kilonovae within the relevant\nGW-detection range of $\\sim$ 200 Mpc in short ($\\lesssim$ 12-second) exposure\ntimes for a week following the merger. Despite this sensitivity, a kilonova\nsearch fully covering a fiducial localized area of $10$ $\\mbox{deg}^2$ will not\nbe viable with NIRCam due to its limited field of view. However, targeted\nsurveys may be developed to optimize the likelihood of discovering kilonovae\nefficiently within limited observing time.

Because the gas is predominantly transferred when the\nbinary is at apocenter, we find the eccentricity grows rapidly while\nmaintaining constant $a(1+e)$.

The\nnorthern part of the front appears the sharpest, with a width smaller than 2.5\nkpc (1.5 Coulomb mean free paths; at 99 per cent confidence). Everywhere along\nthe front, the temperature discontinuity is narrower than 4-8 kpc and the\nmetallicity gradient is narrower than 6 kpc, indicating that diffusion,\nconduction and mixing are suppressed across the interface. Such transport\nprocesses can be naturally suppressed by magnetic fields aligned with the cold\nfront. Interestingly, comparison to magnetohydrodynamic simulations indicates\nthat in order to maintain the observed sharp density and temperature\ndiscontinuities, conduction must also be suppressed along the magnetic field\nlines. However, the northwestern part of the cold front is observed to have a\nnon-zero width. While other explanations are possible, the broadening is\nconsistent with the presence of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) on\nlength-scales of a few kpc.

Our\nsimulations, in contrast, exhibit a stronger relationship, and show that\nprevious work was box-size limited: turbulent `eddies' were artificially\nrestricted by the numerical domain rather than by the scale height.\nZero-net-flux runs without physical diffusion coefficients yield a stress\nproportional to $P^{0.5}$, where P is pressure. The stresses are also\nproportional to the grid length and hence remain numerically unconverged. The\nsame runs with physical diffusivities, however, give a result closer to an\nalpha-disk: the stress is proportional to $P^{0.9}$. Net-flux simulations\nwithout explicit diffusion exhibit stresses proportional to $P^{0.5}$, but\nstronger imposed fields weaken this correlation. In summary, compressibility is\nimportant for the saturation of the MRI, but the exact stress-pressure\nrelationship is difficult to ascertain in local simulations because of\nnumerical convergence issues and the influence of any imposed flux.

Abstract: Collisions of white dwarfs (WDs) have recently been invoked as a possible\nmechanism for type Ia supernovae (SNIa). A pivotal feature for the viability of\nWD collisions as SNIa progenitors is that a significant fraction of the mass is\nhighly compressed to the densities required for efficient $^{56}$Ni production\nbefore the ignition of the detonation wave. Previous studies have predominantly\nemployed model WDs composed entirely of carbon-oxygen (CO), whereas WDs are\nexpected to have a non-negligible helium envelope. Given that helium is more\nsusceptible to explosive burning than CO under the conditions characteristic of\nWD collision, a legitimate concern is whether or not early time He detonation\nignition can translate to early time CO detonation, thereby drastically\nreducing $^{56}$Ni synthesis. We investigate the role of He in determining the\nfate of WD collisions by performing a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamics\ncalculations. We find that a necessary condition for non-trivial reduction of\nthe CO ignition time is that the He detonation birthed in the contact region\nsuccessfully propagates into the unshocked shell. We determine the minimal He\nshell mass as a function of the total WD mass that upholds this condition.\nAlthough we utilize a simplified reaction network similar to those used in\nprevious studies, our findings are in good agreement with detailed\ninvestigations concerning the impact of network size on He shell detonations.\nThis allows us to extend our results to the case with more realistic burning\nphysics. Based on the comparison of these findings against evolutionary\ncalculations of WD compositions, we conclude that most, if not all, WD\ncollisions will not be drastically impacted by their intrinsic He components. \n\n"}

Since the\nunderlying finite volume scheme is still written in terms of cell averages of\nthe conserved quantities, our new approach performs the spatial WENO\nreconstruction twice: the first WENO reconstruction is carried out on the known\ncell averages of the conservative variables.

The scenario of X-ray scattering around\ncircum-burst dusty medium has been supported by previous works due to its\noverall successful prediction of both the temporal and spectral evolution of\nsome X-ray afterglows. To further investigate the observed feature of spectral\nsoftening, we now systematically search the X-ray afterglows detected by X-Ray\nTelescope (XRT) of Swift and collect twelve GRBs with significant late-time\nspectral softening. We find that dust scattering could be the dominant\nradiative mechanism for these X-ray afterglows regarding their temporal and\nspectral features. For some well observed bursts with high-quality data, their\ntime-resolved spectra could be well produced within the scattering scenario by\ntaking into account the X-ray absorption from circum-burst medium. We also find\nthat during spectral softening the power-law index in the high energy end of\nthe spectra does not vary much. The spectral softening is mainly manifested by\nthe spectral peak energy continually moving to the soft end. \n\n"}

More recently, isolated, highly dispersed pulses dubbed fast\nradio bursts (FRBs) have been identified as the potential signature of an\nextragalactic cataclysmic radio source distinct from pulsars and RRATs.\nClusterrank helped us discover 14 pulsars and 8 RRATs in data from the Arecibo\n327 MHz Drift Pulsar Survey (AO327).

The DMs of all\nnew discoveries are consistent with a Galactic origin.

Repeated observations through\n2016 have not detected radio pulsations again. The torque on the neutron star,\nas inferred from its rotation frequency derivative f-dot, decreased in an\nunsteady manner by a factor of 3 in the first year of radio monitoring. In\ncontrast, during its final year as a detectable radio source, the torque\ndecreased steadily by only 9%. The period-averaged flux density, after\ndecreasing by a factor of 20 during the first 10 months of radio monitoring,\nremained steady in the next 22 months, at an average of 0.7+/-0.3 mJy at 1.4\nGHz, while still showing day-to-day fluctuations by factors of a few. There is\nevidence that during this last phase of radio activity the magnetar had a steep\nradio spectrum, in contrast to earlier behavior. There was no secular decrease\nthat presaged its radio demise. During this time the pulse profile continued to\ndisplay large variations, and polarimetry indicates that the magnetic geometry\nremained consistent with that of earlier times.

A critical uncertainty in extracting\nthe intensity, spectrum, and morphology of this excess concerns the accuracy of\nastrophysical diffuse gamma-ray emission models near the GC. Recently, it has\nbeen noted that many diffuse emission models utilize a cosmic-ray injection\nrate far below that predicted based on the observed star formation rate in the\nCentral Molecular Zone. In this study, we add a cosmic-ray injection component\nwhich non-linearly traces the Galactic H2 density determined in\nthree-dimensions, and find that the associated gamma-ray emission is degenerate\nwith many properties of the GC gamma-ray excess. In models that utilize a large\nsideband (40x40 deg surrounding the GC) to normalize the best-fitting diffuse\nemission models, the intensity of the GC excess decreases by a factor of 2, and\nthe morphology of the excess becomes less peaked and less spherically\nsymmetric. In models which utilize a smaller region of interest (15x15 deg) the\naddition of an excess template instead suppresses the intensity of the best-fit\nastrophysical diffuse emission, and the GC excess is rather resilient to\nchanges in the details of the astrophysical diffuse modeling. In both analyses,\nthe addition of a GC excess template still provides a statistically significant\nimprovement to the overall fit to the gamma-ray data. We also implement\nadvective winds at the GC, and find that the Fermi-LAT data strongly prefer\noutflows of order several hundred km/s, whose role is to efficiently advect\nlow-energy cosmic rays from the Galactic center.

These events with visual peak\nmagnitudes $\\lesssim-21$ are called superluminous SNe (SLSNe). Aims: There are\na few intermediate events which have luminosities between these two classes.\nHere we study one such object, SN 2012aa. Methods: The optical photometric and\nspectroscopic follow-up observations of the event were conducted over a time\nspan of about 120 days. Results: With V_abs at peak ~-20 mag, the SN is an\nintermediate-luminosity transient between regular SNe Ibc and SLSNe. It also\nexhibits an unusual secondary bump after the maximum in its light curve. We\ninterpret this as a manifestation of SN-shock interaction with the CSM. If we\nwould assume a $^{56}$Ni-powered ejecta, the bolometric light curve requires\nroughly 1.3 M_sun of $^{56}$Ni and an ejected mass of ~14 M_sun. This would\nalso imply a high kinetic energy of the explosion, ~5.4$\\times10^{51}$ ergs. On\nthe other hand, the unusually broad light curve along with the secondary peak\nindicate the possibility of interaction with CSM. The third alternative is the\npresence of a central engine releasing spin energy that eventually powers the\nlight curve over a long time. The host of the SN is a star-forming Sa/Sb/Sbc\ngalaxy. Conclusions: Although the spectral properties and velocity evolution of\nSN 2012aa are comparable to those of normal SNe Ibc, its broad light curve\nalong with a large peak luminosity distinguish it from canonical CCSNe,\nsuggesting the event to be an intermediate-luminosity transient between CCSNe\nand SLSNe at least in terms of peak luminosity.

The scientific\nobjectives of the mission put a special emphasis on two categories of GRBs:\nvery distant GRBs at z$>$5 which constitute exceptional cosmological probes,\nand faint/soft nearby GRBs which allow probing the nature of the progenitors\nand the physics at work in the explosion. These goals have a major impact on\nthe design of the mission: the on-board hard X-ray imager is sensitive down to\n4 keV and computes on line image and rate triggers, and the follow-up\ntelescopes on the ground are sensitive in the NIR.

At\nz=0.1018, it is one of the closest and the UV brightest such events, with 17.4\n(AB) magnitude in Swift UV band (1928A) at -11days pre-maximum. Assuming an\nexponential form, we derived the rise time of 33days and the peak bolometric\nluminosity of 3x10^{44}ergs^-1. At maximum light, the estimated photospheric\ntemperature and velocity are 17,000K and 14,000kms^-1 respectively. The\ninferred radiative and kinetic energy are roughly 1x10^{51} and 2x10^{52}erg.\nGaia16apd is extremely UV luminous, emitting 50% of its total luminosity at\n1000 - 2500A. Compared to the UV spectra (normalized at 3100A) of well studied\nSN1992A (Ia), SN2011fe(Ia), SN1999em (IIP) and SN1993J (IIb), it has orders of\nmagnitude more far-UV emission. This excess is interpreted primarily as a\nresult of weaker metal line blanketing due to much lower abundance of\niron-group elements in the outer ejecta. Because these elements originate\neither from the natal metallicity of the star, or have been newly produced, our\nobservation provides direct evidence that little of these freshly synthesized\nmaterial, including 56Ni, was mixed into the outer ejecta, and the progenitor\nmetallicity is likely sub-solar.

Higher photospheric temperature of Gaia16apd than that of normal\nSNe may also contribute to the observed far-UV excess.

We present a novel idea for detecting planets bound to such mass\ntransfer binaries: we propose that the X-ray light curves of these binaries be\ninspected for signatures of transiting planets. X-ray transits may be the only\nway to detect planets around some systems, while providing a complementary\napproach to optical and/or radio observations in others. Any planets associated\nwith X-ray binaries must be in stable orbits. We consider the range of\nallowable separations and find that orbital periods can be hours or longer,\nwhile transit durations extend upward from about a minute for Earth-radius\nplanets in very close orbits, to hours for Jupiter-radius planets in wider\norbits.

The stellar evolution was computed using\nthe STELLAR evolution code developed by Yorke & Bodenheimer with recent\nmodifications by Hosokawa et al.

The disagreement between accreting and\nnon-accreting models in terms of the total stellar luminosity L_st, stellar\nradius R_st and effective temperature T_eff depends on the thermal efficiency\nof accretion, i.e., on the fraction of accretion energy absorbed by the central\nobject.

We present afterglow photometry obtained in seven bands with\nthe GROND imager as well as in further seven bands with the UVOT telescope\non-board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.

We furthermore undertake a photometric study of\nthe host galaxy. We find a strong, chromatic rebrightening event at approx 0.8\ndays after the GRB, during which the spectral slope becomes redder. After this,\nthe light curve decays achromatically, with evidence for a break at about 9\ndays after the trigger. The afterglow luminosity is found to not be\nexceptional. We find that a double-jet model is able to explain the chromatic\nrebrightening. The afterglow features have been detected in other events and\nare not unique.

Microscopic cosmic ray transport processes are\nfundamental for determining the efficiency of cosmic ray wind driving. Previous\nstudies focused on modeling of cosmic ray transport either via constant\ndiffusion coefficient or via streaming proportional to the Alfven speed.\nHowever, in predominantly cold, neutral gas, cosmic rays can propagate faster\nthan in the ionized medium and the effective transport can be substantially\nlarger; i.e., cosmic rays can decouple from the gas. We perform\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of patches of galactic\ndisks including the effects of cosmic rays. Our simulations include the\ndecoupling of cosmic rays in the cold, neutral interstellar medium. We find\nthat, compared to the ordinary diffusive cosmic ray transport case, accounting\nfor the decoupling leads to significantly different wind properties such as the\ngas density and temperature, significantly broader spatial distribution of\ncosmic rays, and larger wind speed. These results have implications for X-ray,\ngamma-ray and radio emission, and for the magnetization and pollution of the\ncircumgalactic medium by cosmic rays. \n\n"}

The level of systematic uncertainties in\nthe O/Fe ratio is estimated to be around 20-30%, while the systematic\nuncertainties in the absolute O and Fe abundances can be as high as 50% in\nextreme cases. We were able to identify and correct a systematic bias in the\noxygen abundance determination, which was due to an inaccuracy in the spectral\nmodel.

However we should ask: Do we expect to find\ntransients in these voids given our understanding of the various heating\nsources operating in astrophysical transients? In this work, we explore a broad\nrange of theoretical models and empirical relations to generate optical light\ncurves and to populate the duration-luminosity phase space (DLPS).

However, the distance of the\noutflows with respect to the central engine is poorly constrained, which limits\nour understanding of their kinetic power as a cosmic feedback channel.\nTherefore, the impact of AGN outflows on their host galaxies is uncertain.\nHowever, when the density of the outflows is known, their distance can be\nimmediately obtained from their modelled ionization parameter. With the new\nself-consistent PhotoIONization (PION) model in the SPEX code, we are able to\ncalculate detailed level populations, including the ground and metastable\nlevels. This enables us to determine under what physical conditions the\nmetastable levels are significantly populated.

Besides using the angular momentum of the 15 solar-mass model\nas obtained in the stellar evolution calculation with an angular frequency of\nabout 0.001 rad/s (spin period of more than 6000 s) at the Si/Si-O interface,\nwe also computed 2D and 3D cases with no rotation and with a ~300 times shorter\nrotation period and different angular resolutions. In 2D, only the nonrotating\nand slowly rotating models explode, while rapid rotation prevents an explosion\nwithin 500 ms after bounce because of lower radiated neutrino luminosities and\nmean energies and thus reduced neutrino heating. In contrast, only the fast\nrotating model develops an explosion in 3D when the Si/Si-O interface collapses\nthrough the shock.

This behaviour might be explained by quasispherical accretion onto a\nslowly rotating magnetised neutron star. In quiescence, the neutron star in\n4U1700-37 is surrounded by a hot radiatively cooling shell. Its presence is\nsupported by the detection of mHz quasi periodic oscillations likely produced\nby its convection cells. The high plasma temperature and the relatively low\nX-ray luminosity observed during the quiescence, point to a small emitting area\nabout 1 km, compatible with a hot spot on a NS surface.

We also found that pair production in the outer\nmagnetosphere is not critical for filling the whole magnetosphere with plasma.\nWe study how the current density distribution supporting the global\nelectromagnetic configuration is formed by analyzing particle trajectories. We\nfound that electrons precipitate to the return current layer inside the light\ncylinder and positrons precipitate to the current sheet outside the light\ncylinder by crossing magnetic field lines contributing to the charge density\ndistribution required by the global electrodynamics. Moreover, there is a\npopulation of electrons trapped in the region close to the Y-point. On the\nother hand the most energetic positrons are accelerated close to the Y-point.\nThese processes can have observational signatures that, with further modeling\nefforts, would help to distinguish this particular magnetosphere configuration\nfrom others. \n\n"}

If the spectral shape of protons and nuclei is equal in all the Galaxy,\nthe dominant, hadronic component of the diffuse gamma ray flux must have an\nangular distribution that, after correcting for absorption effects, is energy\nindependent.\n  To study experimentally the validity of this factorization of the energy and\nangular dependence of the diffuse flux it is necessary to compare observations\nin a very broad energy range. The extension of the observations to energies\n$E_\\gamma \\simeq 0.1$--10~PeV is of great interest, because it allows the study\nof the cosmic ray spectra around the feature known as the \"knee\".\n  The absorption probability for photons in this energy range is not\nnegligible, and distorts the energy and angular distributions of the diffuse\nflux, therefore a precise calculation of the absorption effects is necessary\nfor the interpretation of the data.\n  In this work we present predictions of the diffuse gamma ray flux at very\nhigh energy, constructed under different hypothesis for the space dependence of\nthe cosmic ray energy spectra, and discuss the potential of the observations\nfor present and future detectors. \n\n"}

A\nparameter which is common to and plays a key role in both the GW and the EM\nanalyses is the viewing angle of the binary's orbit.

Information about the viewing angle of the binary\norbital plane is therefore crucial to the interpretation of both the GW and the\nEM data, and can potentially be extracted from either side.\n  In the first part of this study, we present a systematic analysis of how well\nthe viewing angle of binary neutron stars can be measured from the GW data.

SNe that are randomly\ndistributed throughout a galactic disc drive inefficient galactic winds because\nmost supernova remnants lose their energy radiatively before breaking out of\nthe disc. Accounting for the fact that most star formation is clustered\nalleviates this problem. Super-bubbles driven by the combined effects of\nclustered SNe propagate rapidly enough to break out of galactic discs well\nbefore the clusters' SNe stop going off. The radiative losses post-breakout are\nreduced dramatically and a large fraction ($\\gtrsim 0.2$) of the energy\nreleased by SNe vents into the halo powering a strong galactic wind. These\nenergetic winds are capable of providing strong preventative feedback and eject\nsubstantial mass from the galaxy with outflow rates on the order of the star\nformation rate. The momentum flux in the wind is only of order that injected by\nthe SNe, because the hot gas vents before doing significant work on the\nsurroundings.

The morphology of these \"TeV halos\" requires\ncosmic-ray diffusion to be locally suppressed by a factor of ~100-1000 compared\nto the typical interstellar medium. No model currently explains this\nsuppression. We show that cosmic-ray self-confinement can significantly inhibit\ndiffusion near pulsars. The steep cosmic-ray gradient generates Alfven waves\nthat resonantly scatter the same cosmic-ray population, suppressing diffusion\nwithin ~20 pc of pulsars younger than ~100 kyr. In this model, TeV halos evolve\nthrough two phases, a growth phase where Alfven waves are resonantly generated\nand cosmic-ray diffusion becomes increasingly suppressed, and a subsequent\nrelaxation phase where the diffusion coefficient returns to the standard\ninterstellar value. Intriguingly, cosmic-rays are not strongly confined early\nin the TeV halo evolution, allowing a significant fraction of injected e+e- to\nescape.

Since ALPs only mix with the parallel mode of the photon, the\npolarization of the soft and hard X-ray spectra is predicted to have an O-mode\ncomponent, in addition to the mainly X-mode component given by most\nastrophysical models. The relative strength of the O-mode component depends on\nthe intensity of ALPs produced in the core and the probability of conversion.\nWe quantify our results by considering X-ray emission produced both by\nastrophysical processes and by ALP-photon conversion, in an uncorrelated\nfashion, and in different relative proportions, which we parametrize by the\nangle $\\chi_0$. We then define a normalized astrophysics-subtracted Stokes\nparameter $R$ which only acquires non-zero values in the presence of ALP-photon\nconversion.

In\nthis work, we focus on GRBs detected by the Fermi satellite and study the\ndistribution of their durations measured in the observer's reference frame and,\nfor those with known redshifts, in the bursts' reference frames. However, there\nare relatively few bursts with measured redshifts, and this makes an accurate\nstudy difficult.

We present here a\ngeneral scheme to disentangle physical and geometrical effects in the data\ninterpretation, which is especially powerful when the transition zone of the\nshock is spatially resolved and the spectral resolution is high enough to allow\na detailed investigation of spatial changes of the line profile. We then apply\nthis technique to re-analyze very high quality data of a region along the\nnorthwestern limb of the remnant of SN~1006.

To do this, we first\nsummarise the observational evidence for the value of the dimensionless\naccretion disc viscosity parameter $\\alpha$, defined by Shakura & Sunyaev\n(1973, 1976). We find that, for fully ionized discs, the value of $\\alpha$ is\nreadily amenable to reliable estimation and that the observations are\nconsistent with the hypothesis that $\\alpha \\sim 0.2 - 0.3$. In contrast in\ndiscs that are not fully ionized, estimates of the value of $\\alpha$ are\ngenerally less direct and the values obtained are generally $ < 0.01$ and often\n$ \\ll 0.01$.

First, in fully ionized discs the\nstrength of the turbulence is always limited by being at most trans-sonic. This\nimplies that it is necessary that credible models of the turbulence reflect\nthis fact.

By employing publicly available X-ray and\noptical data and catalogues we discover 68 type 2 AGN candidates. The X-ray\npowers of these sources are estimated by using a previously known correlation\nbetween X-ray luminosity and X-ray-to-optical flux ratio.

Based on the derived\nX-ray powers, our candidates are likely to be at relatively high redshifts, z ~\n3, with the QSO 2 at z ~ 4. By going ~ 3 magnitudes fainter than previously\nknown type 2 AGN in the two GOODS fields we are sampling a region of redshift -\npower space which was previously unreachable with classical methods. Our method\nbrings to 40 the number of QSO 2 in the GOODS fields, an improvement of a\nfactor ~ 4 when compared to the only 9 such sources previously known.

This\npaper explores one possible regulating mechanism associated with an active\ngalactic nucleus at cluster center. A steady-state model for the intracluster\nmedium is presented in which radiative cooling is balanced by a combination of\nturbulent heating and thermal conduction. The turbulence is generated by\nconvection driven by the buoyancy of cosmic rays produced by a central radio\nsource. The cosmic-ray luminosity is powered by the accretion of intracluster\nplasma onto a central black hole. The model makes the rather extreme assumption\nthat the cosmic rays and thermal plasma are completely mixed. Although the\nintracluster medium is convectively unstable near cluster center in the model\nsolutions, the specific entropy of the thermal plasma still increases outwards\nbecause of the cosmic-ray modification to the stability criterion. The model\nprovides a self-consistent calculation of the turbulent velocity as a function\nof position, but fails to reproduce the steep central density profiles observed\nin clusters. The principal difficulty is that in order for the fully mixed\nintracluster medium to become convectively unstable, the cosmic-ray pressure\nmust become comparable to or greater than the thermal pressure within the\nconvective region. The large cosmic-ray pressure gradient then provides much of\nthe support against gravity, reducing the thermal pressure gradient near\ncluster center and decreasing the central plasma density gradient.

Because of the tight overlapping of the MeV\nphoton flow with the shocked regions, the optical depth for the GeV photons\nproduced in the shocks is very large. These high energy photons are absorbed by\nthe MeV photon flow and generate relativistic e^\\pm pairs. These pairs\nre-scatter the soft X-ray photons from the forward shock as well as the prompt\n\\gamma-ray photons and power detectable high energy emission, significant part\nof which is in the sub-GeV energy range. Since the total energy contained in\nthe forward shock region and the reverse shock region are comparable, the\npredicted sub-GeV emission is independent on whether the GRB ejecta are\nmagnetized (in which case the reverse shock IC and synchrotron self-Compton\nemission is suppressed).

No evidence for chargino or\nneutralino production has been found. Upper limits on chargino and neutralino\npair production cross-sections are obtained as a function of the chargino mass,\nthe lightest neutralino mass, and the second lightest neutralino mass. For\nlarge chargino masses the limits have been improved with respect to the\nprevious analyses at lower centre-of-mass energies. Exclusion regions at 95%\nconfidence level of parameters of the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model are determined for the case of a large universal scalar mass,\nm_0, implying heavy scalar fermions, and for the case of a small m_0 resulting\nin light scalar fermions and giving the worst-case limits.

It is\nassumed that the internal space background can be stabilized by minima of an\neffective potential. The conformal excitations over such a background have the\nform of massive scalar fields (gravitational excitons) propagating in the\nexternal spacetime. We discuss cosmological and astrophysical implications of\nthe interaction between gravexcitons and four-dimensional photons as well as\nconstraints arising on multidimensional models of the type considered in our\npaper. In particular, we show that due to the experimental bounds on the\nvariation of the fine structure constant, gravexcitons should decay before\nnucleosynthesis starts. For a successful nucleosynthesis the masses of the\ndecaying gravexcitons should be m>10^4 GeV. Furthermore, we discuss the\npossible contribution of gravexcitons to UHECR. It is shown that, at energies\nof about 10^{20}eV, the decay length of gravexcitons with masses m>10^4 GeV is\nvery small, but that for m <10^2 GeV it becomes much larger than the\nGreisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cut-off distance. Finally, we investigate the\npossibility for gravexciton-photon oscillations in strong magnetic fields of\nastrophysical objects.
