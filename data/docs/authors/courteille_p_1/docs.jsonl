Abstract: Does there exist a limit for the applicability of quantum theory for objects\nof large mass or size, or objects whose states are of large complexity or\ndimension of the Hilbert space? The possible answers range from practical\nlimitations due to decoherence within quantum theory to fundamental limits due\nto collapse models that modify quantum theory. Here, we suggest the viewpoint\nthat there might be also fundamental limits without altering the quantum laws.\nWe first demonstrate that for two quantum spins systems of a given spin length,\nno violation of local realism can be observed, if the measurements are\nsufficiently coarse-grained. Then we show that there exists a fundamental limit\nfor the precision of measurements due to (i) the Heisenberg uncertainty\nrelation which has to be applied to the measuring apparatus, (ii) relativistic\ncausality, and (iii) the finiteness of resources in any laboratory including\nthe whole universe. This suggests that there might exist a limit for the size\nof the systems (dimension of the Hilbert space) above which no violation of\nlocal realism can be seen anymore. \n\n"}

Current technologies allow the\ntransmission of entangled photon pairs across distances up to roughly 100\nkilometers. For longer distances, noise arising from various sources degrade\nthe transmission of entanglement to the point that it becomes impossible to use\nthe entanglement as a resource for future tasks. A strategy for dealing with\nthis difficulty is to employ quantum repeaters, stations intermediate between\nthe sender and receiver which participate in the process of entanglement\ndistillation, thereby improving on what the sender and receiver could do on\ntheir own.

For small cavity\ndecay rate, the emission events are uncorrelated and the number of photons in\nthe emitted field becomes larger than one, resembling the build-up of a laser\nfield inside the cavity. At intermediate decay rates (as compared to the\nemitter-cavity coupling) and for few emitters, the statistics of the emitted\nradiation is bunched and strikingly dependent on the parity of the number of\nemitters.

The generic cost of quantum algorithms for\nthese problems is determined by the inverse spectral gap of H for that\neigenstate and the cost of evolving with H for some fixed time. The goal of\nspectral gap amplification is to construct a Hamiltonian H' with the same\neigenstate as H but a bigger spectral gap, requiring that constant-time\nevolutions with H' and H are implemented with nearly the same cost. We show\nthat a quadratic spectral gap amplification is possible when H satisfies a\nfrustration-free property and give H' for these cases. This results in quantum\nspeedups for optimization problems. It also yields improved constructions for\nadiabatic simulations of quantum circuits and for the preparation of projected\nentangled pair states (PEPS), which play an important role in quantum many-body\nphysics. Defining a suitable black-box model, we establish that the quadratic\namplification is optimal for frustration-free Hamiltonians and that no spectral\ngap amplification is possible, in general, if the frustration-free property is\nremoved. A corollary is that finding a similarity transformation between a\nstoquastic Hamiltonian and the corresponding stochastic matrix is hard in the\nblack-box model, setting limits to the power of some classical methods that\nsimulate quantum adiabatic evolutions. \n\n"}

Two cases are considered. The first one is the\ncounterflowing (Vinen) turbulence, where the vortex lines are disordered, and\nthe evolution of quantity $\\mathcal{L}(t)$ obeys the Vinen equation. The second\ncase is the quasi-classic turbulence, where vortex lines are believed to form\nthe so called vortex bundles, and their dynamics is described by the HVBK\nequations. The latter case, is of a special interest, since a number of recent\nexperiments demonstrate the $\\omega ^{-5/3}$ dependence for spectrum VLD,\ninstead of $\\omega ^{1/3}$ law, typical for spectrum of vorticity. In\nnonstationary situation, in particular, in the fluctuating turbulent flow there\nis a retardation between the instantaneous value of the normal velocity and the\nquantity $\\mathcal{L}$. This retardation tends to decrease in the accordance\nwith the inner dynamics, which has a relaxation character. In both cases the\nrelaxation dynamics of VLD is related to fluctuations of the relative velocity,\nhowever if for the Vinen case the rate of temporal change for $\\mathcal{L}(t)$\nis directly depends on $\\delta \\mathbf{v}_{ns}$, for the HVBK dynamics it\ndepends on $\\nabla \\times \\delta \\mathbf{v}_{ns}$. As a result, for the\ndisordered case the spectrum $<\\delta \\mathcal{L}(\\omega) \\delta\n\\mathcal{L}(-\\omega)>$ coincides with the spectrum $\\omega ^{-5/3} $.

Our simulations show a dramatic\nreduction of the crystal growth velocity due to HIs even at moderate\nhydrodynamic coupling. A detailed analysis shows that this slowdown is due to\nthe wall-like properties of the crystal surface, which reduces the colloidal\ndiffusion towards the crystal surface by hydrodynamic screening.\nCrystallization in suspensions therefore differs strongly from pure melts,\nmaking them less useful as a toy model than previously thought. \n\n"}

Although apparently simple in its scope, the study of ionic dynamics\nin confined geometries has revealed interesting new phenomena that have an\nalmost one-to-one correspondence with the quantum regime. The picture that\nemerges is that ions can form two `quasi-particle' states, one in which they\nsurround themselves with other ions of opposite charge - ionic atmosphere - and\none in which semi-bound water molecules form layers at different distances from\nthe ions - hydration layers. The second state gives rise to two additional\neffects. In the first, which is a single quasi-particle effect, the ionic\nconductance through a nanopore is predicted to be `quantized' as a function of\npore radius, with the corresponding `quantization units' not related to\nuniversal constants - like the Plank constant and the elementary charge - but\nrather to the radii of the hydration layers. The second effect instead involves\nthe many-body interaction among ionic quasi-particles of the same sign, and\noccurs when the pore has a finite capacitance to accommodate ions so that there\nis a threshold concentration beyond which ions of the same sign are not\nenergetically allowed to enter the pore. Similar to the electron transport\ncase, the ionic counterpart appears only in the `quantum' regime, when the\nhydration layers forming the ionic quasi-particles need to break in order to\npass through the pore.

One\npromising potential implementation is to use superconducting quantum bits in\nthe circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture. There, the low energy\nstates of a nonlinear electronic oscillator are isolated and addressed as a\nqubit. These qubits are capacitively coupled to the modes of a\nmicrowave-frequency transmission line resonator which serves as a quantum\ncommunication bus. Microwave electrical pulses are applied to the resonator to\nmanipulate or measure the qubit state. State control is calibrated using\ndiagnostic sequences that expose systematic errors. Hybridization of the\nresonator with the qubit gives it a nonlinear response when driven strongly,\nuseful for amplifying the measurement signal to enhance accuracy. Qubits\ncoupled to the same bus may coherently interact with one another via the\nexchange of virtual photons. A two-qubit conditional phase gate mediated by\nthis interaction can deterministically entangle its targets, and is used to\ngenerate two-qubit Bell states and three-qubit GHZ states. These three-qubit\nstates are of particular interest because they redundantly encode quantum\ninformation.

Using a\nthree-qubit Toffoli gate, this code is demonstrated to autonomously correct\neither bit- or phase-flip errors.

The solid helium sample is separated from each of the reservoirs by\nVycor rods that allow only the superfluid component to flow. With an improved\ntechnique, measurements of the flow, $F$, at several fixed solid helium\ntemperatures, $T$, have been made as function of $\\Delta \\mu$ in the pressure\nrange 25.5 - 26.1 bar.

Band insulators and superfluids are,\nhowever, fundamentally different: while the former exist in the absence of\ninter-particle interactions, the latter are broken symmetry states that owe\ntheir very existence to such interactions. In particular, unlike the static\nenergy gap of a band insulator, the gap in a superfluid is due to a dynamical\norder parameter that is subject to both thermal and quantum fluctuations. In\nthis work, we explore the consequences of bulk quantum fluctuations of the\norder parameter in the $B$ phase of superfluid $^3$He on the topologically\nprotected Majorana surface states.

From an operational point of view, a steering test can be seen as an\nentanglement test where one of the parties performs uncharacterised\nmeasurements. Thus, quantum steering is a form of quantum inseparability that\nlies in between the well-known notions of Bell nonlocality and entanglement.\nMoreover, quantum steering is also related to several asymmetric quantum\ninformation protocols where some of the parties are considered untrusted.\nBecause of these facts, quantum steering has received a lot of attention both\ntheoretically and experimentally. The main goal of this review is to give an\noverview of how to characterise quantum steering through semidefinite\nprogramming. This characterisation provides efficient numerical methods to\naddress a number of problems, including steering detection, quantification, and\napplications.

In the even-order case, a regularly decomposable\ntensor is a completely decomposable tensor but not vice versa; a completely\ndecomposable tensors is a sum-of-squares (SOS) tensor but not vice versa; an\nSOS tensor is a positive semi-definite (PSD) tensor but not vice versa. In the\nodd-order case, the first row tensor of a regularly decomposable tensor is\nregularly decomposable and its other row tensors are induced by the regular\ndecomposition of its first row tensor.

We argue that a notion of classical\nsimulation, which we call epsilon-simulation, captures the essence of\npossessing \"equivalent computational power\" as the quantum system it simulates:\nIt is statistically impossible to distinguish an agent with access to an\nepsilon-simulator from one possessing the simulated quantum system.

In contrast, some exactly solvable models\nshowcase a more benign power-law-like scaling, when only a small\nnon-equilibrium fragment of the equilibrium system is measured. Does this mean\nthat a part may contain more information about the global temperature than the\nwhole? Certainly not. Here, we resolve this apparent paradox. First, we prove\nthat local quantum thermometry at low $T$ is exponentially inefficient in\nnon-critical, gapped, and infinite spin and harmonic lattices. In contrast, we\nshow through an open-system analysis, that the thermal sensitivity of a\nharmonic thermometer (probe) jointly equilibrated with a reservoir (sample) by\nmeans of an Ohmic coupling scheme, displays a distinctive power-law-like\nbehavior as $T \\rightarrow 0$. To reconcile these two results, we exploit the\nfact that local thermometry on a harmonic chain may be viewed as a temperature\nmeasurement on an oscillator in a discretized harmonic environment: A gapped\ntranslationally invariant chain (for which low--$T$ thermometry is indeed\nexponentially inefficient) maps into a non-standard open-system model where the\nlow-frequency modes of the sample decouple from the probe. On the contrary, a\ngapless instance of such chain gives rise to the canonical Ohmic probe-sample\ninteraction, which does include sample modes of arbitrarily low frequency. In\nthis way, we show that the power-law-like thermometric performance observed in\ntypical dissipative models stems from the fact that these are gapless and, as\nsuch, not subjected to the exponential limitations of their gapped\ncounterparts. The key feature of many-body systems, when it comes to the\nultimate limitations of low--$T$ thermometry, is thus whether or not their\nenergy spectrum is gapped. \n\n"}

In this\nrespect two intertwined aspects are important: stability and reversibility. It\nis crucial to understand on the one hand how a glass may become unstable due to\nincreased plasticity under shear deformations; on the other hand, to what\nextent the response is reversible, meaning how much a system is able to recover\nthe original configuration once the perturbation is released. Here we focus on\nassemblies of hard spheres as the simplest model of amorphous solids such as\ncolloidal glasses and granular matter. We prepare glass states quenched from\nequilibrium supercooled liquid states, which are obtained by using the swap\nMonte Carlo algorithm and correspond to a wide range of structural relaxation\ntime scales. We exhaustively map out their stability and reversibility under\nvolume and shear strains, using extensive numerical simulations. The region on\nthe volume-shear strain phase diagram where the original glass state remains\nsolid is bounded by the shear-yielding and the shear-jamming lines which meet\nat a yielding-jamming crossover point. This solid phase can be further divided\ninto two sub-phases: the stable glass phase where the system deforms purely\nelastically and is totally reversible, and the marginal glass phase where it\nexperiences stochastic plastic deformations at mesoscopic scales and is\npartially irreversible. The details of the stability-reversibility map depend\nstrongly on the quality of annealing of the glass. This study provides a\nunified framework for understanding elasticity, plasticity, yielding and\njamming in amorphous solids. \n\n"}

A\npreviously studied set of XOR games, known not to give a positive answer to the\nquestion, are those for which there is a quantum strategy that attains value 1\nusing a so-called Schmidt state.

We present\nsemiclassical, but otherwise first principle, study of this process at all\nenergies of colliding particles. We find that direct tunneling to the final\nstate occurs at energies below the critical value E_c, which is slightly higher\nthan the barrier height. Tunneling probability grows with energy in this\nregime. Above the critical energy, the tunneling mechanism is different. The\ntransition proceeds through creation of a state close to the top of the\npotential barrier (sphaleron) and its subsequent decay. At certain limiting\nenergy E_l tunneling probability ceases to grow. At higher energies the\ndominant mechanism of transition becomes the release of energy excess E-E_l by\nthe emission of a few particles and then tunneling at effectively lower energy\nE=E_l via the limiting semiclassical configuration.

We\nconsider the first passage times for the case of classical diffusion,\ncharacterized by a mean-square displacement of the form $< (\\Delta x)^2> \\sim\nt$, and for the case of anomalous diffusion or subdiffusion, characterized by a\nmean-square displacement of the form $< (\\Delta x)^2> \\sim t^{\\gamma}$ with\n$0<\\gamma<1$. In the context of classical diffusion, we obtain an expression\nfor the mean first passage time and show that this quantity changes when the\ndirection of the sawtooth is reversed or, equivalently, when the reflecting and\nabsorbing boundaries are exchanged. We discuss at which numbers of `teeth' $N$\n(or number of DNA nucleotides) and at which heights of the sawtooth potential\nthis difference becomes significant. For large $N$, it is well known that the\nmean first passage time scales as $N^2$. In the context of subdiffusion, the\nmean first passage time does not exist. Therefore we obtain instead the\ndistribution of first passage times in the limit of long times. We show that\nthe prefactor in the power relation for this distribution is simply the\nexpression for the mean first passage time in classical diffusion. We also\ndescribe a hypothetical experiment to calculate the average of the first\npassage times for a fraction of passage events that each end within some time\n$t^*$.

The case of Quantum Kicked Top Abstract: Properties related to entanglement in quantum systems, are known to be\nassociated with distinct properties of the corresponding classical systems, as\nfor example stability, integrability and chaos. This means that the detailed\ntopology, both local and global, of the classical phase space may reveal, or\ninfluence, the entangling power of the quantum system. As it has been shown in\nthe literature, the bifurcation points, in autonomous dynamical systems, play a\ncrucial role for the onset of entanglement. Similarly, the existence of scars\namong the quantum states seems to be a factor in the dynamics of entanglement.\nHere we study these issues for a non-autonomous system, the Quantum Kicked Top,\nas a collective model of a multi-qubit system. Using the bifurcation diagram of\nthe corresponding classical limit (the Classical Kicked Top), we analyzed the\npair-wise and the bi-partite entanglement of the qubits and their relation to\nscars, as a function of the critical parameter of the system.

But some scholars criticize this conviction, defending\nlocal realism in various ways. We present here a new viewpoint based on an\nimproved version of the extended semantic realism (ESR) model that has been\nrecently worked out by one of the authors. The ESR model embodies the\nmathematical formalism of SQM into a more general framework in which not only\nlocal realism but also objectivity of physical properties holds, and the\nprobabilities of SQM are reinterpreted as conditional instead of absolute.\nHence the ESR model provides some predictions that are formally identical to\nthose of SQM but have a different physical interpretation, and further\npredictions that differ also formally from those of SQM. In particular, we show\nhere that the BI introduced by Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (BCHSH\ninequalities) must be replaced by modified BCHSH inequalities. These depend on\ndetection probabilities which may be such that the new inequalities are never\nviolated by the conditional expectation values predicted by the model. The\ncondition that no violation occurs implies the existence of upper bounds on\ndetection probabilities, which makes the ESR model falsifiable.
