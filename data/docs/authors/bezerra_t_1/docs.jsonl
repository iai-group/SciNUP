Sensitivity comes first, by means of proposing a simple and\nunambiguous statistical recipe to derive the sensitivity to a putative Majorana\nneutrino mass, m_bb.

We also propose a \"physics-motivated range\" (PMR)\nof the nuclear matrix elements as a unifying criterium between the different\nnuclear models. The expected performance of the proposals is parametrized in\nterms of only four numbers: energy resolution, background rate (per unit time,\nisotope mass and energy), detection efficiency, and bb isotope mass.

Through these processes, this work\nexplored the constituent structure of baryons and the mechanisms through which\nthe interactions between these constituents ultimately control the selected\nreactions. First, hard nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering was studied\nconsidering the quark exchange (QE) between the nucleons to be the dominant\nmechanism of interaction in the constituent picture. It was found that an\nangular asymmetry exhibited by proton-neutron (pn) elastic scattering data is\nexplained within this framework if a quark-diquark picture dominates the\nnucleon's structure instead of a more traditional SU(6) model. The latter\nyields an asymmetry around 90 deg center of mass scattering with a sign\nopposite to what is experimentally observed. The second process is the hard\nbreakup by a photon of a nucleon-nucleon system in light nuclei. Proton-proton\n(pp) and pn breakup in 3He, and double Delta-isobars production in deuteron\nbreakup were analyzed in the hard rescattering model (HRM), which in\nconjunction with the QE mechanism provides a QCD description of the reaction.\nCross sections for both channels in 3He photodisintegration were computed\nwithout the need of a fitting parameter. The results presented here for pp\nbreakup show excellent agreement with recent experimental data. In double\nDelta-isobars production in deuteron breakup, HRM angular distributions for the\ntwo double Delta channels were compared to the pn channel and to each other. An\nimportant prediction from this study is that the Delta++ Delta- channel\nconsistently dominates Delta+Delta0, which is in contrast with models that\nunlike the HRM consider a double Delta system in the initial state of the\ninteraction. For such models both channels should have the same strength. \n\n"}

These\nsimulations have mostly been run with a source beam outside the detector. In\nthe case of low-background physics, however, a primary concern is the effect on\nthe detector from radioactivity inherent in the detector parts themselves. From\nthis standpoint, there is no single source or beam, but rather a collection of\nsources with potentially complicated spatial extent. LUXSim is a simulation\nframework used by the LUX collaboration that takes a component-centric approach\nto event generation and recording. A new set of classes allows for multiple\nradioactive sources to be set within any number of components at run time, with\nthe entire collection of sources handled within a single simulation run.\nVarious levels of information can also be recorded from the individual\ncomponents, with these record levels also being set at runtime. This\nflexibility in both source generation and information recording is possible\nwithout the need to recompile, reducing the complexity of code management and\nthe proliferation of versions.

In a proton run with the LHC 7-TeV beam, one can analyze pp, pd and pA\ncollisions at sqrt(s_NN)~115 GeV and even higher using the Fermi motion in a\nnuclear target. In a Pb run with a 2.76 TeV-per-nucleon beam, sqrt(s_NN) is as\nhigh as 72 GeV. Bent crystals can be used to extract about 5x10^8 protons/s;\nthe integrated luminosity over a year reaches 0.5fb-1 on a typical 1 cm-long\ntarget without species limitation. Such an extraction mode does not alter the\nperformance of the collider experiments at the LHC. By instrumenting the\ntarget-rapidity region, gluon and heavy-quark proton and neutron PDFs can be\naccessed at large x and even at x larger than 1 in the nuclear case.

This anisotropy is characterized via a Fourier expansion of the\ndistribution of charged particles in azimuthal angle (phi), with the\ncoefficients v_n denoting the magnitude of the anisotropy. Significant v_2-v_6\nvalues are obtained as a function of transverse momentum (0.5<pT<20 GeV),\npseudorapidity (|eta|<2.5) and centrality using an event plane method. The v_n\nvalues for n>=3 are found to vary weakly with both eta and centrality, and\ntheir pT dependencies are found to follow an approximate scaling relation,\nv_n^{1/n}(pT) \\propto v_2^{1/2}(pT). A Fourier analysis of the charged particle\npair distribution in relative azimuthal angle (Dphi=phi_a-phi_b) is performed\nto extract the coefficients v_{n,n}=<cos (n Dphi)>. For pairs of charged\nparticles with a large pseudorapidity gap (|Deta=eta_a-eta_b|>2) and one\nparticle with pT<3 GeV, the v_{2,2}-v_{6,6} values are found to factorize as\nv_{n,n}(pT^a,pT^b) ~ v_n(pT^a)v_n(pT^b) in central and mid-central events. Such\nfactorization suggests that these values of v_{2,2}-v_{6,6} are primarily due\nto the response of the created matter to the fluctuations in the geometry of\nthe initial state. A detailed study shows that the v_{1,1}(pT^a,pT^b) data are\nconsistent with the combined contributions from a rapidity-even v_1 and global\nmomentum conservation. A two-component fit is used to extract the v_1\ncontribution.

The signature of the signal is a monoenergetic peak at 2039 keV, the\nQ-value of the decay, Q_bb. To avoid bias in the signal search, the present\nanalysis does not consider all those events, that fall in a 40 keV wide region\ncentered around Q_bb. The main parameters needed for the neutrinoless double\nbeta decay analysis are described. A background model was developed to describe\nthe observed energy spectrum. The model contains several contributions, that\nare expected on the basis of material screening or that are established by the\nobservation of characteristic structures in the energy spectrum. The model\npredicts a flat energy spectrum for the blinding window around Q_bb with a\nbackground index ranging from 17.6 to 23.8*10^{-3} counts/(keV kg yr). A part\nof the data not considered before has been used to test if the predictions of\nthe background model are consistent.

The CAPTAIN detector is a liquid argon\nTPC deployed in a portable and evacuable cryostat.

We\npropose to use the proton linac of the European Spallation Source currently\nunder construction in Lund, Sweden to deliver, in parallel with the spallation\nneutron production, a very intense, cost effective and high performance\nneutrino beam. The baseline program for the European Spallation Source linac is\nthat it will be fully operational at 5 MW average power by 2022, producing 2\nGeV 2.86 ms long proton pulses at a rate of 14 Hz. Our proposal is to upgrade\nthe linac to 10 MW average power and 28 Hz, producing 14 pulses/s for neutron\nproduction and 14 pulses/s for neutrino production. Furthermore, because of the\nhigh current required in the pulsed neutrino horn, the length of the pulses\nused for neutrino production needs to be compressed to a few $\\mu$s with the\naid of an accumulator ring. A long baseline experiment using this Super Beam\nand a megaton underground Water Cherenkov detector located in existing mines\n300-600 km from Lund will make it possible to discover leptonic CP violation at\n5 $\\sigma$ significance level in up to 50% of the leptonic Dirac CP-violating\nphase range.

Abstract: Since its first observation in 2005, the vector charmonium $Y(4260)$ has\nturned out to be one of the prime candidates for an exotic state in the\ncharmonium spectrum. It was recently proposed that the $Y(4260)$ should have a\nprominent $D_1\\bar{D}+c.c.$ molecular component that is strongly correlated\nwith the production of the charged $Z_c(3900)$. In this paper we demonstrate\nthat the nontrivial cross section line shapes of $e^+e^-\\to J/\\psi\\pi\\pi$ and\n$h_c\\pi\\pi$ can be naturally explained by the molecular scenario. As a\nconsequence we find a significantly smaller mass for the $Y(4260)$ than\nprevious studied.

Improved measurements of\nthese observables are therefore crucial for a better understanding of the\nstructure of this famous resonance. \n\n"}

The\nperformance and stability of these characteristic features of the detector are\ndescribed, and details of the material budget are given.

MS is also the dominating source for\nhit confusion and track uncertainties in low energy precision experiments. In\nall such environments, where MS dominates, track reconstruction and fitting can\nbe largely simplified by using three-dimensional (3D) hit-triplets as provided\nby pixel detectors. This simplification is possible since track uncertainties\nare solely determined by MS if high precision spatial information is provided.\nFitting of hit-triplets is especially simple for tracking detectors in\nsolenoidal magnetic fields. The over-constrained 3D-triplet method provides a\ncomplete set of track parameters and is robust against fake hit combinations.\nThe triplet method is ideally suited for pixel detectors where hits can be\ntreated as 3D-space points.

In measurements of\nthe basic weak muon capture reaction on the proton to determine the\npseudoscalar coupling g_P, capture occurs from both atomic and molecular\nstates. Thus knowledge of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ is required for a correct\ninterpretation of these experiments.\n  Purpose: Recently the MuCap experiment has measured the capture rate\n\\Lambda_S from the singlet p\\mu\\ atom, employing a low density active target to\nsuppress pp\\mu\\ formation (PRL 110, 12504 (2013)). Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm\nof argon, a competing process to pp\\mu\\ formation was introduced, which allowed\nthe extraction of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ from the observed time distribution of decay\nelectrons.\n  Results: The pp\\mu\\ formation rate was measured as \\lambda_pp\\mu = (2.01 +-\n0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1. This result updates the \\lambda_pp\\mu\\\nvalue used in the above mentioned MuCap publication.\n  Conclusions: The 2.5x higher precision compared to earlier experiments and\nthe fact that the measurement was performed at nearly identical conditions to\nthe main data taking, reduces the uncertainty induced by \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ to a\nminor contribution to the overall uncertainty of \\Lambda_S and g_P, as\ndetermined in MuCap. Our final value for \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ shifts \\Lambda_S and\ng_P by less than one tenth of their respective uncertainties compared to our\nresults published earlier. \n\n"}

If the neutral gauge boson corresponding to this abelian\nsymmetry is ultra-light, then it will give rise to flavor-dependent long-range\nleptonic force, which can have significant impact on neutrino oscillations. For\nan instance, the electrons inside the Sun can generate a flavor-dependent\nlong-range potential at the Earth surface, which can suppress the $\\nu_{\\mu}\n\\to \\nu_e$ appearance probability in terrestrial experiments. The sign of this\npotential is opposite for anti-neutrinos, and affects the oscillations of\n(anti-)neutrinos in different fashion. This feature invokes fake CP-asymmetry\nlike the SM matter effect and can severely affect the leptonic CP-violation\nsearches in long-baseline experiments. In this paper, we study in detail the\npossible impacts of these long-range flavor-diagonal neutral current\ninteractions due to $L_e-L_{\\mu}$ symmetry, when (anti-)neutrinos travel from\nFermilab to Homestake (1300 km) and CERN to Pyh\\\"asalmi (2290 km) in the\ncontext of future high-precision superbeam facilities, DUNE and LBNO\nrespectively.

While in the companion paper\nwe focus on DBD, in this paper we focus on the results regarding the search for\ndark matter candidates, both axions and WIMPs. Small ultra-low background\nMicromegas detectors are used to image the x-ray signal expected in axion\nhelioscopes like CAST at CERN. Background levels as low as $0.8\\times 10^{-6}$\nc keV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ have already been achieved in CAST while values\ndown to $\\sim10^{-7}$ c keV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ have been obtained in a\ntest bench placed underground in the Laboratorio Subterr\\'aneo de Canfranc.\nProspects to consolidate and further reduce these values down to $\\sim10^{-8}$\nc keV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$will be described. Such detectors, placed at the\nfocal point of x-ray telescopes in the future IAXO experiment, would allow for\n10$^5$ better signal-to-noise ratio than CAST, and search for solar axions with\n$g_{a\\gamma}$ down to few 10$^{12}$ GeV$^{-1}$, well into unexplored axion\nparameter space. In addition, a scaled-up version of these TPCs, properly\nshielded and placed underground, can be competitive in the search for low-mass\nWIMPs. The TREX-DM prototype, with $\\sim$0.300 kg of Ar at 10 bar, or\nalternatively $\\sim$0.160 kg of Ne at 10 bar, and energy threshold well below 1\nkeV, has been built to test this concept. We will describe the main technical\nsolutions developed, as well as the results from the commissioning phase on\nsurface. The anticipated sensitivity of this technique might reach\n$\\sim10^{-44}$ cm$^2$ for low mass ($<10$ GeV) WIMPs, well beyond current\nexperimental limits in this mass range. \n\n"}

The counting rule emerges as a scaling behavior\nof cross sections in hard exclusive reactions with large scattering angles, and\nit enables us to determine the number of elementary constituents inside\nhadrons. Therefore, it could be used as a new method for identifying internal\nconstituents of exotic-hadron candidates. From the analyses of the $\\gamma \\, p\n\\to K^{+} \\Lambda$ and $K^{+} \\Sigma ^{0}$ reactions, we find that the number\nof the elementary constituents is consistent with $n_{\\gamma} = 1$, $n_{p} =\n3$, $n_{K^{+}} = 2$, and $n_{\\Lambda} = n_{\\Sigma ^{0}} = 3$. Then, the\nanalysis is made for the photoproductions of the hyperon resonances $\\Lambda\n(1405)$, $\\Sigma (1385)^{0}$, and $\\Lambda (1520)$, where $\\Lambda (1405)$ is\nconsidered to be a $\\bar K N$ molecule and hence its constituent number could\nbe five. However, we find that the current data are not enough to conclude the\nnumbers of their constituent. It is necessary to investigate the higher-energy\nregion at $\\sqrt{s} > 2.8$ GeV experimentally beyond the energy of the\navailable CLAS data for counting the number of constituents clearly. We also\nmention that our results indicate energy dependence in the constituent number,\nespecially for $\\Lambda (1405)$. If an excited hyperon is a mixture of\nthree-quark and five-quark states, the energy dependence of the scaling\nbehavior could be valuable for finding its composition and mixture. \n\n"}

In the so-called 3+1 scheme involving three active and one sterile\nneutrino, the $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ transition probability probed in the LBL\nexperiments acquires a new interference term via active-sterile oscillations.\nWe find that this novel interference term can mimic a swap of the $\\theta_{23}$\noctant, even if one uses the information from both neutrino and antineutrino\nchannels. As a consequence, the sensitivity to the octant of $\\theta_{23}$ can\nbe completely lost and this may have serious implications in our understanding\nof neutrinos from both the experimental and theoretical perspectives. \n\n"}

It can also be formulated as a compelling\ncomponent of dark matter. The haloscope, a leading axion detection scheme,\nrelies on the conversion of galactic halo axions into real photons inside a\nresonant cavity structure in the presence of a static magnetic field, where the\ngenerated photon frequency corresponds to the mass of the axion. For maximum\nsensitivity it is key that the central frequency of the cavity mode structure\ncoincides with the frequency of the generated photon. As the mass of the axion\nis unknown, it is necessary to perform searches over a wide range of\nfrequencies. Currently there are substantial regions of the promising\npre-inflationary low mass axion range without any viable proposals for\nexperimental searches. We show that 3D resonant LC circuits with separated\nmagnetic and electric fields, commonly known as re-entrant cavities, can be\nsensitive dark matter haloscopes in this region, with frequencies inherently\nlower than those achievable in the equivalent size of empty resonant cavity. We\ncalculate the sensitivity and accessible axion mass range of these experiments,\ndesigning geometries to exploit and maximize the separated magnetic and\nelectric coupling of the axion to the cavity mode. \n\n"}

The ECAL and a\nlarge fraction of HCAL will be based on hexagonal silicon sensors of\n0.5-1cm$^{2}$ cell size, with the remainder of the HCAL based on\nhighly-segmented scintillators with SiPM readout. The intrinsic high-precision\ntiming capabilities of the silicon sensors will add an extra dimension to event\nreconstruction, especially in terms of pileup rejection. An overview of the\nHGCAL project is presented, covering motivation, engineering design, readout\nand trigger concepts, and performance (simulated and from beam tests). \n\n"}

Since the\nmediation can be realized through rather light new dynamical fields allowing\nfor non-negligible collider signals in missing energy searches, the framework\nremains valid for the phenomenologically interesting parameter region, while\nretaining correlations dictated by gauge symmetry. Moreover, a richer\nnew-physics sector can be consistently included via higher-dimensional\noperators.

In our\nnumerical calculations we eschew a heavy-quark expansion and rely instead on\nthe observation that the dressed c,b-quark mass functions are well approximated\nby a constant, interpreted as their constituent-mass: we find M_c=1.32 GeV and\nM_b=4.65 GeV. The calculated heavy-meson leptonic decay constants and\ntransition form factors are a necessary element in the experimental\ndetermination of CKM matrix elements. The results also show that this\nframework, as employed hitherto, is well able to describe vector meson\npolarisation observables. \n\n"}

When ground-state correlations are included with an open\n$p$-shell the predictions of the calculations are in reasonable agreement with\nmost of the experimental results for these reactions. Woods-Saxon radial wave\nfunctions are used, with their asymptotic forms matched to the experimental\nseparation energies for bound states, and matched to a binding energy of 0.01\nMeV for unbound states. For comparison purposes, some results are given for\nharmonic oscillator radial functions. Closest agreement between theory and\nexperiment is achieved with unrestricted shell-model configurations and\nWoods-Saxon radial functions. We obtain for the neutrino-absorption inclusive\ncross sections: $\\bar{\\sigma} = 13.8 \\times 10^{-40}$ cm$^2$ for the\n$(\\nu_{\\mu},\\mu^{-})$ decay-in-flight flux in agreement with the LSND datum of\n$(12.4 \\pm 1.8) \\times 10^{-40}$ cm$^2$; and $\\bar{\\sigma} = 12.5 \\times\n10^{-42}$ cm$^2$ for the $(\\nu_{e},e^{-})$ decay-at-rest flux, less than the\nexperimental result of $(14.4 \\pm 1.2) \\times 10^{-42}$ cm$^2$. \n\n"}

The main collision effect is the coherent e+e- pair\ncreation. At low energies (2E < 0.5 - 1 TeV) this process is suppressed due to\nrepulsion of electron beams. In this region gamma-gamma luminosity above\n10^{35} cm-2 s-1 is possible (10^{33} is sufficient).
