This papers presents the averaging analysis within the\nquasispherical Szekeres model which is a non-symmetrical generalisation of the\nspherically symmetric Lema\\^itre--Tolman family of models. Density distribution\nin the quasispherical Szekeres has a structure of a time-dependent mass dipole\nsuperposed on a monopole. This paper shows that when calculating the volume\nacceleration, $\\ddot{a}$, within the Szekeres model, the dipole does not\ncontribute to the final result, hence $\\ddot{a}$ only depends on a monopole\nconfiguration. Thus, the volume averaging within the Szekeres model leads to\nliterally the same solutions as obtained within the Lema\\^itre--Tolman model. \n\n"}

This statistic is designed to pick up\nsystematic brightness trends of SnIa datapoints with respect to a best fit\ncosmological model at high redshifts. It is based on binning the normalized\ndifferences between the SnIa distance moduli and the corresponding best fit\nvalues in the context of a specific cosmological model (eg LCDM). We then focus\non the highest redshift bin and extend its size towards lower redshifts until\nthe Binned Normalized Difference (BND) changes sign (crosses 0) at a redshift\nz_c (bin size N_c). The bin size N_c of this crossing (the statistical\nvariable) is then compared with the corresponding crossing bin size N_{mc} for\nMonte Carlo data realizations based on the best fit model.

Linear and modulational stability show that the soliton solutions are\nsensitive to small perturbations and, therefore, unstable. In general, their\nlifetimes differ for on-site and off-site modes. For the on-site modes, there\nare small areas between the Mott-insulator regions where the lifetime is very\nlarge, and in particular much larger than that for the off-site modes. \n\n"}

Considerations of cosmology in the BIMOND framework suggest that such\nTM might exist and copy matter in its attributes. Here I investigate the\nindirect interactions that BIMOND theories predict between nonrelativistic\nmasses of matter and TM. The most salient result is that in the deep-MOND\nregime of the matter-TM-symmetric theories, TM behaves as if it has a negative\ngravitational mass. To wit, interaction within each sector is attractive MOND\ngravity, but between matter and TM it is repulsive MOND gravity. In the\nhigh-acceleration regime, the interaction depends on a parameter, beta. For the\nfavored value beta=1, matter and TM do not interact in this regime; for beta<1\nthey attract; and for beta>1 they repel each other. Such interactions may have\nsubstantial ramifications for all aspects of structure formation, such as\nmatter distribution, peculiar velocities, and effects on the CMB. The repulsive\ninteractions probably lead to segregation of matter and TM structures, leading,\nin turn, to intermeshing of the respective cosmic webs, with high-density nodes\nof one sector residing in the voids of the other (possibly conducing to\nefficient evacuation of the voids). Weak lensing by TM seems the best way to\nconstrain its attributes. In the MOND regime a TM body acts on matter photons\nas a diverging lens.

In addition, a cycle-based representation model is presented to be\nused as an intermediate format in the proposed synthesis methodology. The\nselected intermediate format serves as a focal point for all potential\nrepresentation models. In order to synthesize a given function, a library\ncontaining seven building blocks is used where each building block is a cycle\nof length less than 6. To synthesize large cycles, we also propose a\ndecomposition algorithm which produces all possible minimal and inequivalent\nfactorizations for a given cycle of length greater than 5.

The generated decompositions are\nused in conjunction with a novel cycle assignment algorithm which is proposed\nbased on the graph matching problem to select the best possible cycle pairs.\nThen, each pair is synthesized by using the available components of the\nlibrary. The decomposition algorithm together with the cycle assignment method\nare considered as a binding method which selects a building block from the\nlibrary for each cycle.

The\nremaining temporal dependence of these functions together with corresponding\nequations of motion are determined from dynamical conditions, obtained by\nconstructing the relativistic proper reference frame of an accelerated test\nparticle. In this frame, the effect of external forces acting on the observer\nis balanced by the fictitious frame-reaction force that is needed to keep the\ntest particle at rest with respect to the frame, conserving its relativistic\nlinear momentum.

We proved that the\nelectromagnetic field contributes at highest order to the nonlinear memory\neffect of gravitational waves, enlarging the permanent displacement of test\nmasses. In experiments like LISA or LIGO which measure distances of test\nmasses, the Christodoulou memory will manifest itself as a permanent\ndisplacement of these objects.

A fraction of these are\nlikely to be members of binaries. Here we discuss the binary population of\nstellar black holes and neutron stars near SMBHs and focus on the secular\nevolution of such binaries, due to the perturbation by the SMBH. Binaries with\nhighly inclined orbits in respect to their orbit around the SMBH are strongly\naffected by secular Kozai processes, which periodically change their\neccentricities and inclinations (Kozai-cycles). During periapsis approach, at\nthe highest eccentricities during the Kozai-cycles, gravitational wave emission\nbecomes highly efficient. Some binaries in this environment can inspiral and\ncoalesce at timescales much shorter than a Hubble time and much shorter than\nsimilar binaries which do not reside near a SMBH. The close environment of\nSMBHs could therefore serve as catalyst for the inspiral and coalescence of\nbinaries, and strongly affect their orbital properties.

Hence even in the presence of strong phase noise\nnon-classical correlations persist between the spin and path of the neutron\nbeam. This indicates that measurements performed on the spin of the neutron\nbeam will induce a disturbance on the path state.

By further assuming that some physical mechanism subsequently\ndisplaced the Earth towards its current distance in such a way that the\nirradiance stayed substantially constant over the entire Archean from 3.8 Gyr\nto 2.5 Gyr ago, a relative recession rate as large as \\dot r/r \\simeq 3.4 x\n10^-11 yr^-1 would have been required.

The mass ratio, $\\varepsilon =\nM/M_\\bullet \\ll 1$, is a natural small parameter implying a separation of time\nscales between the short Kepler orbital periods and the longer orbital\nprecessional periods. The collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) for the\nstellar distribution function (DF) is averaged over the fast Kepler orbital\nphase using the method of multiple scales. The orbit-averaged system is\ndescribed by a secular DF, $F$, in a reduced phase space. $F$ obeys a secular\nCBE that includes stellar self-gravity, general relativistic corrections up to\n1.5 post-Newtonian order, and external sources varying over secular times.\nSecular dynamics, even with general time dependence, conserves the semi-major\naxis of every star.

The thresholds\ndistinguish between the non-Markovian (memory preserving) and Markovian\n(memoryless) regimes of the evolutions that different time scales of the\nevolution of the memory effects and entanglement can be observed.

The starting point of our paper is\nconstituted by the general De~Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian of a system of scalar and\nvector fields, which is supposed to be form-invariant under (global) Lorentz\ntransformations. Following the reasoning of gauge theories, the corresponding\nlocally form-invariant system is worked out by means of canonical\ntransformations. The canonical transformation approach ensures by construction\nthat the form of the action functional is maintained. We thus encounter amended\nHamiltonian systems which are form-invariant under arbitrary spacetime\ntransformations. This amended system complies with the general principle of\nrelativity and describes both, the dynamics of the given physical system's\nfields and their coupling to those quantities which describe the dynamics of\nthe spacetime geometry. In this way, it is unambiguously determined how spin-0\nand spin-1 fields couple to the dynamics of spacetime.\n  A term that describes the dynamics of the free gauge fields must finally be\nadded to the amended Hamiltonian, as common to all gauge theories, to allow for\na dynamic spacetime geometry.

The asymptotic symmetries are spanned\nby an extension of the super-BMS$_3$ algebra, with two independent $\\hat{u}(1)$\ncurrents of electric and magnetic type. These currents are associated to $U(1)$\nfields being even and odd under parity, respectively. Remarkably, although the\n$U(1)$ fields do not generate a backreaction on the metric, they provide\nnontrivial Sugawara-like contributions to the BMS$_3$ generators, and hence to\nthe energy and the angular momentum. The entropy of flat cosmological\nspacetimes with $U(1)$ fields then acquires a nontrivial dependence on the\n$\\hat{u}(1)$ charges. If the spin structure is odd, the ground state\ncorresponds to Minkowski spacetime, and although the anticommutator of the\ncanonical supercharges is linear in the energy and in the electric-like\n$\\hat{u}(1)$ charge, the energy becomes bounded from below by the energy of the\nground state shifted by the square of the electric-like $\\hat{u}(1)$ charge.

Many clustering algorithms work by\napproximating the minimization of an objective function, namely the sum of\nwithin-the-cluster distances between points. The straightforward approach\ninvolves examining all the possible assignments of points to each of the\nclusters. This approach guarantees the solution will be a global minimum,\nhowever the number of possible assignments scales quickly with the number of\ndata points and becomes computationally intractable even for very small\ndatasets. In order to circumvent this issue, cost function minima are found\nusing popular local-search based heuristic approaches such as k-means and\nhierarchical clustering. Due to their greedy nature, such techniques do not\nguarantee that a global minimum will be found and can lead to sub-optimal\nclustering assignments.

We discuss, in particular, how this process forces\ndark energy to behave as a pressureless component if the cosmic evolution is\ndominated by non-relativistic matter. This property is also analyzed in terms\nof the effective sound speed of the dark energy, which correspondingly\napproaches the behavior of the dominant cosmological component, being\neffectively vanishing after matter-radiation equality.

For inviscid binary systems the spin angular velocity of each\ncomponent in a detached phase is smaller than the orbital angular velocity at a\ncontact phase. Thus the irrotational approximation during evolution of binary\nneutron stars due to gravitational wave emission can be justified. Our\ncomputational results show that the binary will never reach a dynamically\nunstable state before a contact phase even for rather stiff polytropes with the\nindex N > 0.7, as the separation of two components decreases due to\ngravitational wave emission. This conclusion is quantitatively different from\nthat of Lai, Rasio & Shapiro who employed approximate solutions for polytropic\nbinary systems. \n\n"}

Unfortunately, perhaps the most intriguing system\nwhere such a tool could be used, a pulsar in orbit with a black hole, has yet\nto be discovered. In this paper we give a detailed investigation of what one\ncan learn about the black hole companion via timing observations of the pulsar.\nWe present an analytic calculation for the propagation delay caused by the\nframe-dragging effect and show that it has the same functional behavior as the\nmodulation of the observed rotational phase of the pulsar caused by the\ndeflection of the radio signals in the gravitational field of the companion\n(bending delay). Thus, contrary to statements of other authors, the\nframe-dragging delay is unlikely to be separately measurable in pulsar binaries\nwhere the companion is a stellar mass black hole.

The geodesic curves of such a metric have\nthe striking property that once an initial position and velocity are set, the\nremainder of the geodesic is completely determined by a second order\ndifferential equation known as the geodesic equation. This is in contrast with\nthe usual case in circuit design, either classical or quantum, where being\ngiven part of an optimal circuit does not obviously assist in the design of the\nrest of the circuit. Geodesic analysis thus offers a potentially powerful\napproach to the problem of proving quantum circuit lower bounds.

The spatial dimensionality of the scheme can be reduced\nto two by converting one spatial axis of the cluster into time. The error\nthreshold is 0.75% for each source in an error model with preparation, gate,\nstorage and measurement errors. The operational overhead is poly-logarithmic in\nthe circuit size. \n\n"}

We correct this\ndeficiency and present a method of resumming divergent series with their proper\nlarge-order behavior.

{"id": "quant-ph/9710035", "contents": "Title: Programming Complex Systems Abstract: Classical programming languages cannot model essential elements of complex\nsystems such as true random number generation. This paper develops a formal\nprogramming language called the lambda-q calculus that addresses the\nfundamental properties of complex systems. This formal language allows the\nexpression of quantumized algorithms, which are extensions of randomized\nalgorithms in that probabilities can be negative, and events can cancel out. An\nillustration of the power of quantumized algorithms is the ability to\nefficiently solve the satisfiability problem, something that many believe is\nbeyond the capability of classical computers. This paper proves that the\nlambda-q calculus is not only capable of solving satisfiability but can also\nsimulate such complex systems as quantum computers. Since satisfiability is\nbelieved to be beyond the capabilities of quantum computers, the lambda-q\ncalculus may be strictly stronger. \n\n"}
