Song {\\it et al.}\n(Nature {\\bf 433}, 392 (2005)) and studied more recently by F. Radicchi {\\it et\nal.} (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 101}, 148701 (2008)), but much simpler and easier\nto implement. In this first paper we apply RSR to critical trees and derive\nanalytical results consistent with numerical simulations. Critical trees\nexhibit three regimes in their evolution under RSR: (i) An initial regime\n$N_0^{\\nu}\\lesssim N<N_0$, where $N$ is the number of nodes at some step in the\nrenormalization and $N_0$ is the initial size. RSR in this regime is described\nby a mean field theory and fluctuations from one realization to another are\nsmall. The exponent $\\nu=1/2$ is derived using random walk arguments. The\ndegree distribution becomes broader under successive renormalization --\nreaching a power law, $p_k\\sim 1/k^{\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma=2$ and a variance\nthat diverges as $N_0^{1/2}$ at the end of this regime.

As more and more people become the active users of\nonline social networks, one may ponder questions such as: (1) Do OSNs indeed\nimprove our sociability?

(3) Can we identify some interesting user behaviors in OSNs?\nOur work in this paper just aims to answer these interesting questions. To this\nend, we pay a revisit to the well-known Dunbar's number in online social\nnetworks. Our main research contributions are as follows. First, to our best\nknowledge, our work is the first one that systematically validates the\nexistence of the online Dunbar's number in the range of [200,300]. To reach\nthis, we combine using local-structure analysis and user-interaction analysis\nfor extensive real-world OSNs.

The\nneighbourhood function provides a wealth of information about the graph (e.g.,\nit easily allows one to compute its diameter), but it is very expensive to\ncompute it exactly. Recently, the ANF algorithm (approximate neighbourhood\nfunction) has been proposed with the purpose of approximating NG(t) on large\ngraphs. We describe a breakthrough improvement over ANF in terms of speed and\nscalability. Our algorithm, called HyperANF, uses the new HyperLogLog counters\nand combines them efficiently through broadword programming; our implementation\nuses overdecomposition to exploit multi-core parallelism. With HyperANF, for\nthe first time we can compute in a few hours the neighbourhood function of\ngraphs with billions of nodes with a small error and good confidence using a\nstandard workstation.

Previous studies are\nconcentrated on a static rumor spreading. The content of the rumor is\ninvariable during the whole spreading process. Indeed, the rumor evolves\nconstantly in its spreading process, which grows shorter, more concise, more\neasily grasped and told. In an early psychological experiment, researchers\nfound about 70% of details in a rumor were lost in the first 6 mouth-to-mouth\ntransmissions \\cite{TPR}. Based on the facts, we investigate rumor spreading on\nsocial networks, where the content of the rumor is modified by the individuals\nwith a certain probability. In the scenario, they have two choices, to forward\nor to modify. As a forwarder, an individual disseminates the rumor directly to\nits neighbors. As a modifier, conversely, an individual revises the rumor\nbefore spreading it out. When the rumor spreads on the social networks, for\ninstance, scale-free networks and small-world networks, the majority of\nindividuals actually are infected by the multi-revised version of the rumor, if\nthe modifiers dominate the networks.

Theoretical models suggest that short-term\ncollective behavior and long-term cultural diversity are mutually excluding,\nsince they require very different levels of social influence. The latter\njointly depends on two factors: the topology of the underlying social network\nand the overlap between individuals in multidimensional cultural space.\nHowever, while the empirical properties of social networks are well understood,\nlittle is known about the large-scale organization of real societies in\ncultural space, so that random input specifications are necessarily used in\nmodels. Here we use a large dataset to perform a high-dimensional analysis of\nthe scientific beliefs of thousands of Europeans. We find that inter-opinion\ncorrelations determine a nontrivial ultrametric hierarchy of individuals in\ncultural space, a result unaccessible to one-dimensional analyses and in\nstriking contrast with random assumptions. When empirical data are used as\ninputs in models, we find that ultrametricity has strong and counterintuitive\neffects, especially in the extreme case of long-range online-like interactions\nbypassing social ties.

We present an efficient method for finding return\nprobability distributions for connected undirected graphs. We argue that return\nprobability has the same discriminatory power as existing k-step measures -- in\nparticular, beta centrality (with negative beta), the graph-theoretical power\nindex (GPI), and subgraph centrality. We compare the running time of our\nalgorithm to beta centrality and subgraph centrality and find that it is\nsignificantly faster. When return probability is used to measure the same\nphenomena as beta centrality, it runs in linear time -- O(n+m), where n and m\nare the number of nodes and edges, respectively -- which takes much less time\nthan either the matrix inversion or the sequence of matrix multiplications\nrequired for calculating the exact or approximate forms of beta centrality,\nrespectively. We call this form of return probability the P\\'{o}lya power index\n(PPI). Computing subgraph centrality requires an expensive eigendecomposition\nof the adjacency matrix; return probability runs in half the time of the\neigendecomposition on a 2000-node network.

While the progressive models are\nsuitable for modeling the spread of influence in monopolistic settings,\nnon-progressive are more appropriate for modeling non-monopolistic settings,\ne.g., modeling diffusion of two competing technologies over a social network.\nDespite the extensive work on the progressive model, non-progressive models\nhave not been studied well.

A variety of computational heuristics, some\nwith a long history, have been proposed for the identification of communities\nor, alternatively, of good graph partitions. In most cases, the algorithms\nmaximize a particular objective function, thereby finding the `right' split\ninto communities. Although a thorough comparison of algorithms is still\nlacking, there has been an effort to design benchmarks, i.e., random graph\nmodels with known community structure against which algorithms can be\nevaluated. However, popular community detection methods and benchmarks normally\nassume an implicit notion of community based on clique-like subgraphs, a form\nof community structure that is not always characteristic of real networks.\nSpecifically, networks that emerge from geometric constraints can have natural\nnon clique-like substructures with large effective diameters, which can be\ninterpreted as long-range communities. In this work, we show that long-range\ncommunities escape detection by popular methods, which are blinded by a\nrestricted `field-of-view' limit, an intrinsic upper scale on the communities\nthey can detect. The field-of-view limit means that long-range communities tend\nto be overpartitioned. We show how by adopting a dynamical perspective towards\ncommunity detection (Delvenne et al.

The resulting networks are\nthen often considered static. More often than not, the aggregation time window\nis dictated by the availability of data, and the effects of its length on the\nresulting networks are rarely considered. Here, we address this question by\nstudying the structural features of networks emerging from aggregating\nempirical data over different time intervals, focussing on networks derived\nfrom time-stamped, anonymized mobile telephone call records. Our results show\nthat short aggregation intervals yield networks where strong links associated\nwith dense clusters dominate; the seeds of such clusters or communities become\nalready visible for intervals of around one week. The degree and weight\ndistributions are seen to become stationary around a few days and a few weeks,\nrespectively. An aggregation interval of around 30 days results in the stablest\nsimilar networks when consecutive windows are compared. For longer intervals,\nthe effects of weak or random links become increasingly stronger, and the\naverage degree of the network keeps growing even for intervals up to 180 days.\nThe placement of the time window is also seen to affect the outcome: for short\nwindows, different behavioural patterns play a role during weekends and\nweekdays, and for longer windows it is seen that networks aggregated during\nholiday periods are significantly different. \n\n"}

In particular, roles of ties are not\nyet clear to the academic community.\n  Methodology/Principle Findings: Every edges is stamped by its strength that\nis defined solely based on the local topology. According to a weighted\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible model, the steady-state infected density and\nspreading speed are respectively optimized by adjusting the relationship\nbetween edge's strength and spreading ability. Experiments on six real networks\nshow that the infected density is increased when strong ties are favored in the\nspreading, while the speed is enhanced when weak ties are favored. Significance\nof these findings is further demonstrated by comparing with a null model.\n  Conclusions/Significance: Experimental results indicate that strong and weak\nties play distinguishable roles in spreading dynamics: the former enlarge the\ninfected density while the latter fasten the process.

The social context plays an important\nrole in determining our actions, and often we imitate friends or acquaintances\nwithout any strategic consideration. We explore here the interplay between\nstrategic and social imitative behaviors in a coordination problem on a social\nnetwork. We observe that for interactions in 1D and 2D lattices any amount of\nsocial imitation prevents the freezing of the network in domains with different\nconventions, thus leading to global consensus. For interactions in complex\nnetworks, the interplay of social and strategic imitation also drives the\nsystem towards global consensus while neither dynamics alone does. We find an\noptimum value for the combination of imitative behaviors to reach consensus in\na minimum time, and two different dynamical regimes to approach it: exponential\nwhen social imitation predominates, and power-law when strategic considerations\ndominate. \n\n"}

However, we show that DeGroot's\nwell-known model of opinion formation based on repeated averaging can never be\npolarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We generalize\nDeGroot's model to account for a phenomenon well-known in social psychology as\nbiased assimilation: when presented with mixed or inconclusive evidence on a\ncomplex issue, individuals draw undue support for their initial position\nthereby arriving at a more extreme opinion.

In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation,\nis not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased assimilation\nalso provides insight into the following related question: do internet based\nrecommender algorithms that show us personalized content contribute to\npolarization?

We also revisit another non-consensus\nopinion, the inflexible contrarian opinion (ICO) model, which introduces\ninflexible contrarians to model a competition between two opinions in the\nsteady state. In the ICO model, the inflexible contrarians effectively decrease\nthe size of the largest cluster of the rival opinion.

In this paper a different\napproach is presented: the formalism of exponential random graphs is used and\nthe distances are treated as constraints, to be imposed on a previously chosen\nensemble of graphs. Then, the information encoded in the geographical distances\nis used to explain the binary structure of the World Trade Web, by testing it\non the degree-degree correlations and the reciprocity structure.

For the latter response, we assume social\nherding, i.e. agents adopt their strategy based on the frequencies of the\ndifferent strategies in their neighborhood, without taking into account the\nconsequences of this decision. We note that f_i already determines the payoff,\nso there is no additional information assumed. A parameter \\zeta defines to\nwhat level agents take the two different information sources into account. For\nthe strategic interaction, we assume a Prisoner's Dilemma game, i.e. one in\nwhich defection is the evolutionary stable strategy.

We first obtain the $K$ leading\neigenvectors of $A$, say, $\\hat{\\eta}_1,\\ldots,\\hat{\\eta}_K$, and let $\\hat{R}$\nbe the $n\\times (K-1)$ matrix such that\n$\\hat{R}(i,k)=\\hat{\\eta}_{k+1}(i)/\\hat{\\eta}_1(i)$, $1\\leq i\\leq n$, $1\\leq\nk\\leq K-1$. We then use $\\hat{R}$ for clustering by applying the $k$-means\nmethod. The central surprise is, the effect of degree heterogeneity is largely\nancillary, and can be effectively removed by taking entry-wise ratios between\n$\\hat{\\eta}_{k+1}$ and $\\hat{\\eta}_1$, $1\\leq k\\leq K-1$. The method is\nsuccessfully applied to the web blogs data and the karate club data, with error\nrates of $58/1222$ and $1/34$, respectively. These results are more\nsatisfactory than those by the classical spectral methods. Additionally,\ncompared to modularity methods, SCORE is easier to implement, computationally\nfaster, and also has smaller error rates. We develop a theoretic framework\nwhere we show that under mild conditions, the SCORE stably yields consistent\ncommunity detection. In the core of the analysis is the recent development on\nRandom Matrix Theory (RMT), where the matrix-form Bernstein inequality is\nespecially helpful. \n\n"}

As such, modelling\nopinion dynamics represents an important research area that has been\nprogressively acquiring relevance in many different domains. Existing\napproaches have mostly represented opinions through discrete binary or\ncontinuous variables by exploring a whole panoply of cases: e.g. independence,\nnoise, external effects, multiple issues. In most of these cases the crucial\ningredient is an attractive dynamics through which similar or similar enough\nagents get closer. Only rarely the possibility of explicit disagreement has\nbeen taken into account (i.e., the possibility for a repulsive interaction\namong individuals' opinions), and mostly for discrete or 1-dimensional\nopinions, through the introduction of additional model parameters. Here we\nintroduce a new model of opinion formation, which focuses on the interplay\nbetween the possibility of explicit disagreement, modulated in a\nself-consistent way by the existing opinions' overlaps between the interacting\nindividuals, and the effect of external information on the system. Opinions are\nmodelled as a vector of continuous variables related to multiple possible\nchoices for an issue. Information can be modulated to account for promoting\nmultiple possible choices.

The social cohesion approach posits that social\ngroups arise out of an aggregation of individuals that have mutual\ninterpersonal attraction as they share common characteristics. These\ncharacteristics can range from common interests to kinship ties and from social\nvalues to ethnic backgrounds. In contrast, the social identity approach posits\nthat an individual is likely to join a group based on an intrinsic\nself-evaluation at a cognitive or perceptual level. In other words group\nmembers typically share an awareness of a common category membership.\n  In this work we seek to understand the role of these two contrasting theories\nin explaining the behavior and stability of social communities in Twitter.

If the infection strength is higher than a\ncertain threshold -- which we define as the epidemic threshold - then the\nepidemic spreads through the population and persists in the long run. For a\nsingle generic graph representing the contact network of the population under\nconsideration, the epidemic threshold turns out to be equal to the inverse of\nthe spectral radius of the contact graph. However, in a real world scenario it\nis not possible to isolate a population completely: there is always some\ninterconnection with another network, which partially overlaps with the contact\nnetwork. Results for epidemic threshold in interconnected networks are limited\nto homogeneous mixing populations and degree distribution arguments. In this\npaper, we adopt a spectral approach. We show how the epidemic threshold in a\ngiven network changes as a result of being coupled with another network with\nfixed infection strength. In our model, the contact network and the\ninterconnections are generic. Using bifurcation theory and algebraic graph\ntheory, we rigorously derive the epidemic threshold in interconnected networks.\nThese results have implications for the broad field of epidemic modeling and\ncontrol.

Fake Profile Identification in Online Social Networks Abstract: The amount of personal information unwillingly exposed by users on online\nsocial networks is staggering, as shown in recent research. Moreover, recent\nreports indicate that these networks are infested with tens of millions of fake\nusers profiles, which may jeopardize the users' security and privacy. To\nidentify fake users in such networks and to improve users' security and\nprivacy, we developed the Social Privacy Protector software for Facebook. This\nsoftware contains three protection layers, which improve user privacy by\nimplementing different methods. The software first identifies a user's friends\nwho might pose a threat and then restricts this \"friend's\" exposure to the\nuser's personal information. The second layer is an expansion of Facebook's\nbasic privacy settings based on different types of social network usage\nprofiles. The third layer alerts users about the number of installed\napplications on their Facebook profile, which have access to their private\ninformation. An initial version of the Social Privacy Protection software\nreceived high media coverage, and more than 3,000 users from more than twenty\ncountries have installed the software, out of which 527 used the software to\nrestrict more than nine thousand friends. In addition, we estimate that more\nthan a hundred users accepted the software's recommendations and removed at\nleast 1,792 Facebook applications from their profiles. By analyzing the unique\ndataset obtained by the software in combination with machine learning\ntechniques, we developed classifiers, which are able to predict which Facebook\nprofiles have high probabilities of being fake and therefore, threaten the\nuser's well-being.

Although\nthis assumption is widely made in Web Science and related fields, the\nunderlying linearity is rarely measured.

An immunization strategy is defined as the\nchoice of a set of nodes (individuals) who cannot catch nor transmit the\ndisease. This choice is performed according to a certain ranking of the nodes\nof the contact network. We consider various ranking strategies, focusing in\nparticular on the role of the training window during which the nodes'\nproperties are measured in the time-varying network: longer training windows\ncorrespond to a larger amount of information collected and could be expected to\nresult in better performances of the immunization strategies. We find instead\nan unexpected saturation in the efficiency of strategies based on nodes'\ncharacteristics when the length of the training window is increased, showing\nthat a limited amount of information on the contact patterns is sufficient to\ndesign efficient immunization strategies.

In\nsmooth geometry, hyperbolicity captures the notion of negative curvature;\nwithin the more abstract context of metric spaces, it can be generalized as\nd-hyperbolicity. This generalized definition can be applied to graphs, which we\nexplore in this report. We provide strong evidence that communication and\nsocial networks exhibit this fundamental property, and through extensive\ncomputations we quantify the degree of hyperbolicity of each network in\ncomparison to its diameter. By contrast, and as evidence of the validity of the\nmethodology, applying the same methods to the road networks shows that they are\nnot hyperbolic, which is as expected. Finally, we present practical\ncomputational means for detection of hyperbolicity and show how the test itself\nmay be scaled to much larger graphs than those we examined via renormalization\ngroup methodology.

As a result, it is possible to predict not only someone's\nlocation from their friends' locations but also friendship from spatial and\ntemporal co-occurrence. While several models have been developed to separately\ndescribe mobility and the evolution of social networks, there is a lack of\nstudies coupling social interactions and mobility. In this work, we introduce a\nnew model that bridges this gap by explicitly considering the feedback of\nmobility on the formation of social ties.

Our model\nreproduces various topological and physical properties of these networks such\nas: i) the size of the connected components, ii) the distance distribution\nbetween connected users, iii) the dependence of the reciprocity on the\ndistance, iv) the variation of the social overlap and the clustering with the\ndistance.

First, we replace the rewiring probability parameter by a\ndistribution of probability of accepting or rejecting opinions between\nindividuals, accounting for the asymmetric influences in relationships among\nindividuals in a social group. Second, we modify the rewiring step by a\npath-length-based preference for rewiring that reinforces local clustering. We\nhave investigated the influences of these modifications on the outcomes of the\nsimulations of this model. We found that varying the shape of the distribution\nof probability of accepting or rejecting opinions can lead to the emergence of\ntwo qualitatively distinct final states, one having several isolated connected\ncomponents each in internal consensus leading to the existence of diverse set\nof opinions and the other having one single dominant connected component with\neach node within it having the same opinion.

They are also thought to be fundamental to the\nevolution of biological systems, human society, and technology. By opening new\npossibilities, one novelty can pave the way for others in a process that\nKauffman has called \"expanding the adjacent possible\". The dynamics of\ncorrelated novelties, however, have yet to be quantified empirically or modeled\nmathematically. Here we propose a simple mathematical model that mimics the\nprocess of exploring a physical, biological or conceptual space that enlarges\nwhenever a novelty occurs. The model, a generalization of Polya's urn, predicts\nstatistical laws for the rate at which novelties happen (analogous to Heaps'\nlaw) and for the probability distribution on the space explored (analogous to\nZipf's law), as well as signatures of the hypothesized process by which one\nnovelty sets the stage for another. We test these predictions on four data sets\nof human activity: the edit events of Wikipedia pages, the emergence of tags in\nannotation systems, the sequence of words in texts, and listening to new songs\nin online music catalogues. By quantifying the dynamics of correlated\nnovelties, our results provide a starting point for a deeper understanding of\nthe ever-expanding adjacent possible and its role in biological, linguistic,\ncultural, and technological evolution. \n\n"}

In addition to this, one\nalso observes a resolution limit on the size of communities, where smaller but\nwell-defined clusters are not detectable when the network becomes large. This\nphenomenon occurs not only for the very popular approach of modularity\noptimization, which lacks built-in statistical validation, but also for more\nprincipled methods based on statistical inference and model selection, which do\nincorporate statistical validation in a formally correct way.

The topology is allowed to co-evolve with relational signs as\nwell as with agent strategies. We introduce a strategy that is conditional on\nthe emotional content embedded in network signs. We show that this strategy\nacts as a catalyst and creates favorable conditions for the spread of\nunconditional cooperation.

While a\nlow likelihood of rewiring enhances cooperation, a very high likelihood seems\nto limit its diffusion. Furthermore, unlike in non-signed networks, cooperation\nbecomes more prevalent in denser topologies. \n\n"}

In this paper, we\npropose a centrality measure for temporal networks based on random walks which\nwe call TempoRank.

As a result, we\nare yet to fully understand its impact on network properties and dynamics.

The notion of a \"rich-club\" describes nodes which are essentially\nthe hub of a network, as they play a dominating role in structural and\nfunctional properties. Interestingly, the definition of a rich-club naturally\nemphasizes high degree nodes and divides a network into two subgroups.

There\nis today a growing interest in understanding when and why a description in\nterms of a multiplex network is necessary and more informative than a\nsingle-layer projection. Here, we contribute to this debate by presenting a\ncomprehensive study of correlations in multiplex networks. Correlations in node\nproperties, especially degree-degree correlations, have been thoroughly studied\nin single-layer networks.

The dependency of the former approach to\ntopological features of the network, and unavailability of real diffusion paths\nin the latter, converts the problem of choosing an appropriate sampling\napproach to a trade-off. Second, we formally define the diffusion network\nsampling problem and propose a number of new diffusion-based characteristics to\nevaluate introduced sampling approaches.

Recent works have revealed a new set of \"zero-determinant (ZD)\"\nstrategies, which is an important advance in repeated games. A ZD strategy\nplayer can exert a unilaterally control on two players' payoffs. In particular\nhe can deterministically set the opponent's payoff, or enforce an unfair linear\nrelationship between the players' payoffs, thereby always seizing an\nadvantageous share of payoffs. One of the limitations of the original ZD\nstrategy, however, is that it does not capture the notion of robustness when\nthe game is subjected to stochastic errors. In this paper, we propose a general\nmodel of ZD strategies for noisy repeated games, and find that ZD strategies\nhave high robustness against errors. We further derive the pinning strategy\nunder noise, by which the ZD strategy player coercively set the opponent's\nexpected payoff to his desired level, although his payoff control ability\ndeclines with the increase of noise strength. Due to the uncertainty caused by\nnoise, the ZD strategy player cannot secure his payoff to be higher than the\nopponent's, which implies strong extortions do not exist even under low noise.\nWhile we show that the ZD strategy player can still establish a novel kind of\nextortions, named weak extortions, where any increase of his own payoff always\nexceeds that of the opponent's by a fixed percentage, and the conditions under\nwhich the weak extortions can be realized are more stringent as the noise\nbecomes stronger. \n\n"}

We analyze the expanding\nuser-generated content in Sina Weibo, the largest micro-blog site in China, and\nfind evidence that popular messages often follow a mechanism that differs from\nthat found in the spread of disease, in contrast to common believe. In this\nmechanism, an individual with more friends needs more repeated exposures to\nspread further the information. Moreover, our data suggest that in contrast to\nepidemics, for certain messages the chance of an individual to share the\nmessage is proportional to the fraction of its neighbours who shared it with\nhim/her. Thus the greater the number of friends an individual has the greater\nthe number of repeated contacts needed to spread the message, which is a result\nof competition for attention. We model this process using a fractional\nsusceptible infected recovered (FSIR) model, where the infection probability of\na node is proportional to its fraction of infected neighbors. Our findings have\ndramatic implications for information contagion. For example, using the FSIR\nmodel we find that real-world social networks have a finite epidemic threshold.\nThis is in contrast to the zero threshold that conventional wisdom derives from\ndisease epidemic models. This means that when individuals are overloaded with\nexcess information feeds, the information either reaches out the population if\nit is above the critical epidemic threshold, or it would never be well\nreceived, leading to only a handful of information contents that can be widely\nspread throughout the population. \n\n"}

To understand the effects of power-communication\ncoupling, several have studied interdependent network models and reported that\nincreased coupling can increase system vulnerability. However, these results\ncome from models that have substantially different mechanisms of cascading,\nrelative to those found in actual power and communication networks. This paper\nreports on two sets of experiments that compare the network vulnerability\nimplications resulting from simple topological models and models that more\naccurately capture the dynamics of cascading in power systems. First, we\ncompare a simple model of topological contagion to a model of cascading in\npower systems and find that the power grid shows a much higher level of\nvulnerability, relative to the contagion model. Second, we compare a model of\ntopological cascades in coupled networks to three different physics-based\nmodels of power grids coupled to communication networks. Again, the more\naccurate models suggest very different conclusions. In all but the most extreme\ncase, the physics-based power grid models indicate that increased\npower-communication coupling decreases vulnerability. This is opposite from\nwhat one would conclude from the coupled topological model, in which zero\ncoupling is optimal. Finally, an extreme case in which communication failures\nimmediately cause grid failures, suggests that if systems are poorly designed,\nincreased coupling can be harmful.

In this\npaper, we are interested in finding a source estimator that is applicable to\nvarious spreading models, including the Susceptible-Infected (SI),\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR), Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Infected\n(SIRI), and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) models. We show that under\nthe SI, SIR and SIRI spreading models and with mild technical assumptions, the\nJordan center is the infection source associated with the most likely infection\npath in a tree network with a single infection source. This conclusion applies\nfor a wide range of spreading parameters, while it holds for regular trees\nunder the SIS model with homogeneous infection and recovery rates.

The gross structure of hierarchical networks of this kind\ncan be described by a quotient graph. The rationale of this approach is that\nindividuals infect those belonging to the same community with higher\nprobability than individuals in other communities. In community models the\nnodal infection probability is thus expected to depend mainly on the\ninteraction of a few, large interconnected clusters. In this work, we describe\nthe epidemic process as a continuous-time individual-based\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model using a first-order mean-field\napproximation. A key feature of our model is that the spectral radius of this\nsmaller quotient graph (which only captures the macroscopic structure of the\ncommunity network) is all we need to know in order to decide whether the\noverall healthy-state defines a globally asymptotically stable or an unstable\nequilibrium. Indeed, the spectral radius is related to the epidemic threshold\nof the system. Moreover we prove that, above the threshold, another\nsteady-state exists that can be computed using a lower-dimensional dynamical\nsystem associated with the evolution of the process on the quotient graph. Our\ninvestigations are based on the graph-theoretical notion of equitable partition\nand of its recent and rather flexible generalization, that of almost equitable\npartition. \n\n"}

Bipartite networks represent diverse interaction\npatterns in many real-world systems, such as predator-prey networks,\nplant-pollinator networks, and drug-target networks. While community detection\nin unipartite networks has been extensively studied in the past decade,\nidentification of modules or communities in bipartite networks is still in its\nearly stage. Several quantitative functions proposed for evaluating the quality\nof bipartite network divisions are based on null models and have distinct\nresolution limits.

Because the word \"community\" is an ambiguous term, it is\nnecessary to quantify what it means to be a community within the context of a\nparticular type of problem. Our interpretation is that this quantification must\nbe done at a minimum of three scales. These scales are at the level of:\nindividual nodes, individual communities, and the network as a whole. Each of\nthese scales involves quantitative features of community structure that are not\naccurately represented at the other scales, but are important for defining a\nparticular notion of community. Our work focuses on providing sensible ways to\nquantify what is desired at each of these scales for a notion of community\napplicable to social networks, and using these models to develop a community\ndetection algorithm. Appealing features of our approach is that it naturally\nallows for nodes to belong to multiple communities, and is computationally\nefficient for large networks with low overall edge density.

Further,\nquestionnaire studies have identified important individual differences in\ncircadian rhythms, with people broadly categorised into morning-like or\nevening-like individuals. However, little is known about the social aspects of\nthese circadian rhythms, or how they vary across individuals. In this study we\nuse a unique 18-month dataset that combines mobile phone calls and\nquestionnaire data to examine individual differences in the daily rhythms of\nmobile phone activity. We demonstrate clear individual differences in daily\npatterns of phone calls, and show that these individual differences are\npersistent despite a high degree of turnover in the individuals' social\nnetworks. Further, women's calls were longer than men's calls, especially\nduring the evening and at night, and these calls were typically focused on a\nsmall number of emotionally intense relationships. These results demonstrate\nthat individual differences in circadian rhythms are not just related to broad\npatterns of morningness and eveningness, but have a strong social component, in\ndirecting phone calls to specific individuals at specific times of day. \n\n"}

For example, how much of a\nnetwork's assembly is driven by simple growth? How does a network's structure\nchange as it matures? How does network structure vary with adoption rates and\nuser heterogeneity, and do these properties play different roles at different\npoints in the assembly?

A voting model represents the way in which public perceptions are\nconveyed to voters. Our voting model is constructed by using two types of\nvoters--herders and independents--and two candidates. Independents conduct\nvoting based on their fundamental values; on the other hand, herders base their\nvoting on the number of previous votes. Hence, herders vote for the majority\ncandidates and obtain information relating to previous votes from their\nnetworks. We discuss the difference between the phases on which the networks\ndepend. Two kinds of phase transitions, an information cascade transition and a\nsuper-normal transition, were identified. The first of these is a transition\nbetween a state in which most voters make the correct choices and a state in\nwhich most of them are wrong. The second is a transition of convergence speed.\nThe information cascade transition prevails when herder effects are stronger\nthan the super-normal transition. In the BA and fitness models, the critical\npoint of the information cascade transition is the same as that of the random\nnetwork model. However, the critical point of the super-normal transition\ndisappears when these two models are used. In conclusion, the influence of\nnetworks is shown to only affect the convergence speed and not the information\ncascade transition. We are therefore able to conclude that the influence of\nhubs on voters' perceptions is limited. \n\n"}

In this paper, we study the impact of heterogeneity in\nnetwork fitnesses on the competition between an international network, such as\nFacebook, and local services. The higher fitness of international networks is\ninduced by their ability to attract users from all over the world, which can\nthen establish social interactions without the limitations of local networks.\nIn other words, inter-country social ties lead to increased fitness of the\ninternational network. To study the competition between an international\nnetwork and local ones, we construct a 1:1000 scale model of the digital world,\nconsisting of the 80 countries with the most Internet users. Under certain\nconditions, this leads to the extinction of local networks; whereas under\ndifferent conditions, local networks can persist and even dominate completely.\nIn particular, our model suggests that, with the parameters that best reproduce\nthe empirical overtake of Facebook, this overtake could have not taken place\nwith a significant probability. \n\n"}

Due to\nnon-triviality in finding the exact boundary of such overlapping communities,\nthis problem has become challenging, and therefore huge effort has been devoted\nto detect overlapping communities from the network.\n  In this paper, we present PVOC (Permanence based Vertex-replication algorithm\nfor Overlapping Community detection), a two-stage framework to detect\noverlapping community structure. We build on a novel observation that\nnon-overlapping community structure detected by a standard disjoint community\ndetection algorithm from a network has high resemblance with its actual\noverlapping community structure, except the overlapping part. Based on this\nobservation, we posit that there is perhaps no need of building yet another\noverlapping community finding algorithm; but one can efficiently manipulate the\noutput of any existing disjoint community finding algorithm to obtain the\nrequired overlapping structure. We propose a new post-processing technique that\nby combining with any existing disjoint community detection algorithm, can\nsuitably process each vertex using a new vertex-based metric, called\npermanence, and thereby finds out overlapping candidates with their community\nmemberships. Experimental results on both synthetic and large real-world\nnetworks show that PVOC significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art\noverlapping community detection algorithms in terms of high similarity of the\noutput with the ground-truth structure.

Recently, dynamic message-passing (DMP) has been\nproposed as an efficient algorithm for simulating epidemic models on networks,\nand in particular for estimating the probability that a given node will become\ninfectious at a particular time. To date, DMP has been applied exclusively to\nmodels with one-way state changes, as opposed to models like SIS\n(susceptible-infectious-susceptible) and SIRS\n(susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible) where nodes can return to\npreviously inhabited states. Because many real-world epidemics can exhibit such\nrecurrent dynamics, we propose a DMP algorithm for complex, recurrent epidemic\nmodels on networks. Our approach takes correlations between neighboring nodes\ninto account while preventing causal signals from backtracking to their\nimmediate source, and thus avoids \"echo chamber effects\" where a pair of\nadjacent nodes each amplify the probability that the other is infectious. We\ndemonstrate that this approach well approximates results obtained from Monte\nCarlo simulation and that its accuracy is often superior to the pair\napproximation (which also takes second-order correlations into account).\nMoreover, our approach is more computationally efficient than the pair\napproximation, especially for complex epidemic models: the number of variables\nin our DMP approach grows as $2mk$ where $m$ is the number of edges and $k$ is\nthe number of states, as opposed to $mk^2$ for the pair approximation. We\nsuspect that the resulting reduction in computational effort, as well as the\nconceptual simplicity of DMP, will make it a useful tool in epidemic modeling,\nespecially for inference tasks where there is a large parameter space to\nexplore. \n\n"}

With the increasing availability of network\ndata that changes in time, it is important to extend such eigenvector-based\ncentrality measures to time-dependent networks. In this paper, we introduce a\nprincipled generalization of network centrality measures that is valid for any\neigenvector-based centrality. We consider a temporal network with N nodes as a\nsequence of T layers that describe the network during different time windows,\nand we couple centrality matrices for the layers into a supra-centrality matrix\nof size NTxNT whose dominant eigenvector gives the centrality of each node i at\neach time t. We refer to this eigenvector and its components as a joint\ncentrality, as it reflects the importances of both the node i and the time\nlayer t. We also introduce the concepts of marginal and conditional\ncentralities, which facilitate the study of centrality trajectories over time.\nWe find that the strength of coupling between layers is important for\ndetermining multiscale properties of centrality, such as localization phenomena\nand the time scale of centrality changes. In the strong-coupling regime, we\nderive expressions for time-averaged centralities, which are given by the\nzeroth-order terms of a singular perturbation expansion. We also study\nfirst-order terms to obtain first-order-mover scores, which concisely describe\nthe magnitude of nodes' centrality changes over time.

The latter tendency is known in the\nliterature as the resolution limit problem. To address them, we propose to\nmodify modularity by subtracting from it the fraction of edges connecting nodes\nof different communities and by including community density into modularity. We\nrefer to the modified metric as Modularity Density and we demonstrate that it\nindeed resolves both problems mentioned above.

We obtain probabilities for\nincumbent and newcomer firms to link to other incumbents or newcomers which are\nable to reproduce the topology of the empirical R&D network. The position of\nfirms in a knowledge space is obtained from their patents using two different\nclassification schemes, IPC in 8 dimensions and ISI-OST-INPI in 35 dimensions.\nOur dynamics of knowledge exchange assumes that collaborating firms approach\neach other in knowledge space at a rate $\\mu$ for an alliance duration $\\tau$.\nBoth parameters are obtained in two different ways, by comparing knowledge\ndistances from simulations and empirics and by analyzing the collaboration\nefficiency $\\mathcal{\\hat{C}}_{n}$.

This is very realistic for infrastructure across cities. Each city\nhas its own infrastructures and different infrastructures are dependent within\nthe city. However, each infrastructure is connected within and between cities.\nFor example, a power grid will connect many cities as will a communication\nnetwork, yet a power station and communication tower that are interdependent\nwill likely be in the same city.

As the viral spreading on social\nnetwork is a global process, it is commonly believed that measuring the\ninfluence of nodes inevitably requires the knowledge of the entire network.\nEmploying percolation theory, we show that the spreading process displays a\nnucleation behavior: once a piece of information spread from the seeds to more\nthan a small characteristic number of nodes, it reaches a point of no return\nand will quickly reach the percolation cluster, regardless of the entire\nnetwork structure, otherwise the spreading will be contained locally. Thus, we\nfind that, without the knowledge of entire network, any nodes' global influence\ncan be accurately measured using this characteristic number, which is\nindependent of the network size. This motivates an efficient algorithm with\nconstant time complexity on the long standing problem of best seed spreaders\nselection, with performance remarkably close to the true optimum. \n\n"}

Some individuals engage through online social networks\n(e.g., Facebook, Twitter), while some communicate only through conventional\nways (e.g., face-to-face). Therefore, understanding the dynamics of information\npropagation among humans calls for a multi-layer network model where an online\nsocial network is conjoined with a physical network. In this work, we initiate\na study of information diffusion in a clustered multi-layer network model,\nwhere all constituent layers are random networks with high clustering. We\nassume that information propagates according to the SIR model and with\ndifferent information transmissibility across the networks. We give results for\nthe conditions, probability, and size of information epidemics, i.e., cases\nwhere information starts from a single individual and reaches a positive\nfraction of the population. We show that increasing the level of clustering in\neither one of the layers increases the epidemic threshold and decreases the\nfinal epidemic size in the whole system. An interesting finding is that\ninformation with low transmissibility spreads more effectively with a small but\ndensely connected social network, whereas highly transmissible information\nspreads better with the help of a large but loosely connected social network. \n\n"}

In real networks, the dependency relations between networks\nare neither identical nor completely random. Thus in this paper, we study the\ninfluence of randomness for dependency maps on the robustness of interdependent\nlattice networks. We introduce approximate entropy($ApEn$) as the measure of\nrandomness of the dependency maps.

With the increment of $ApEn$, the $p_c$ increases until\n$ApEn$ reaching ${ApEn}_c'$ and then remains almost constant. The time scale of\nthe system shows rich properties as $ApEn$ increases.

We asks whether\nthe friendship ties between the individuals in a social network successfully\npredict who is at risk. Using a dataset from a popular online review service,\nwe build a time-varying network that is a proxy of physical encounter between\nusers and a static network based on reported friendship. Through computer\nsimulations, we compare infection processes on the resulting networks and show\nthat, whereas distance on the friendship network is correlated to epidemic\nrisk, friendship provides a poor identification of the individuals at risk if\nthe infection is driven by physical encounter. Such limit is not due to the\nrandomness of the infection, but to the structural differences of the two\nnetworks.

In this paper we\nconsider it from the perspective of a multi-layer complex network, built using\na combination of three datasets: Twitter, Flickr and official migration data.\nThose datasets provide different but equally important insights on the global\nmobility: while the first two highlight short-term visits of people from one\ncountry to another, the last one - migration - shows the long-term mobility\nperspective, when people relocate for good. And the main purpose of the paper\nis to emphasize importance of this multi-layer approach capturing both aspects\nof human mobility at the same time. So we start from a comparative study of the\nnetwork layers, comparing short- and long- term mobility through the\nstatistical properties of the corresponding networks, such as the parameters of\ntheir degree centrality distributions or parameters of the corresponding\ngravity model being fit to the network. We also focus on the differences in\ncountry ranking by their short- and long-term attractiveness, discussing the\nmost noticeable outliers. Finally, we apply this multi-layered human mobility\nnetwork to infer the structure of the global society through a community\ndetection approach and demonstrate that consideration of mobility from a\nmulti-layer perspective can reveal important global spatial patterns in a way\nmore consistent with other available relevant sources of international\nconnections, in comparison to the spatial structure inferred from each network\nlayer taken separately. \n\n"}

Identifying the most influential\nnodes in the network can be useful in many applications like immunization of\nnodes in case of epidemic spreading, during intentional attacks on complex\nnetworks. A lot of research is done to devise centrality measures which could\nefficiently identify the most influential nodes in the network. There are two\nmajor approaches to the problem: On one hand, deterministic strategies that\nexploit knowledge about the overall network topology in order to find the\ninfluential nodes, while on the other end, random strategies are completely\nagnostic about the network structure. Centrality measures that can deal with a\nlimited knowledge of the network structure are required. Indeed, in practice,\ninformation about the global structure of the overall network is rarely\navailable or hard to acquire. Even if available, the structure of the network\nmight be too large that it is too much computationally expensive to calculate\nglobal centrality measures.

We find that the diffusion of donations is driven\nby independent reinforcement contagion: people are more likely to donate when\nexposed to donors from different social groups than when they are exposed to\nequally many donors from the same group. Counter-intuitively, being exposed to\none side may increase donations to the other side.

The first mechanism is based on the assumption that\neach node establishes links with its neighbors and introduces new nodes to the\ncommunity at different rates. We demonstrate that this simple mechanism gives\nrise to an effective maximal degree within communities.

This\nissue is particularly challenging for understanding casual and correlational\nrelationships between events. While this topic has received a lot of interest\nin the NLP community, research has been hindered by the lack of a proper\nevaluation framework. This paper attempts to address this problem with a new\nframework for evaluating story understanding and script learning: the 'Story\nCloze Test'. This test requires a system to choose the correct ending to a\nfour-sentence story. We created a new corpus of ~50k five-sentence commonsense\nstories, ROCStories, to enable this evaluation. This corpus is unique in two\nways: (1) it captures a rich set of causal and temporal commonsense relations\nbetween daily events, and (2) it is a high quality collection of everyday life\nstories that can also be used for story generation. Experimental evaluation\nshows that a host of baselines and state-of-the-art models based on shallow\nlanguage understanding struggle to achieve a high score on the Story Cloze\nTest. We discuss these implications for script and story learning, and offer\nsuggestions for deeper language understanding. \n\n"}

In the case of social systems the interaction of\ndifferent individuals leads to the emergence of norms, trends in political\npositions, opinions, cultural traits, and even scientific progress. Examples of\ncollective behavior can be observed in activities like the Wikipedia and Linux,\nwhere individuals aggregate their knowledge for the benefit of the community,\nand citizen science, where the potential of collectives to solve complex\nproblems is exploited. Here, we conducted an online experiment to investigate\nthe performance of a collective when solving a guessing problem in which each\nactor is endowed with partial information and placed as the nodes of an\ninteraction network. We measure the performance of the collective in terms of\nthe temporal evolution of the accuracy, finding no statistical difference in\nthe performance for two classes of networks, regular lattices and random\nnetworks.

However structure of social networks and node attributes are often\ninterpreted separately in the research of community detection.

Many systems have explicit indicators of\nreplies, such as threading in discussion forums or replies and retweets in\nTwitter. However, it is likely these explicit indicators capture only part of\npeople's reactions to each other, thus, computational social science approaches\nthat use them to infer relationships or influence are likely to miss the mark.\nThis paper explores the problem of detecting non-explicit responses, presenting\na new approach that uses tf-idf similarity between a user's own tweets and\nrecent tweets by people they follow. Based on a month's worth of posting data\nfrom 449 ego networks in Twitter, this method demonstrates that it is likely\nthat at least 11% of reactions are not captured by the explicit reply and\nretweet mechanisms. Further, these uncaptured reactions are not evenly\ndistributed between users: some users, who create replies and retweets without\nusing the official interface mechanisms, are much more responsive to followees\nthan they appear. This suggests that detecting non-explicit responses is an\nimportant consideration in mitigating biases and building more accurate models\nwhen using these markers to study social interaction and information diffusion. \n\n"}

We consider the stand-alone quality\nmetrics of modularity, conductance, and coverage, and we consider the\ninformation recovery metrics of adjusted Rand score, normalized mutual\ninformation, and a variant of normalized mutual information used in previous\nwork. Our study includes both synthetic graphs and empirical data sets of sizes\nvarying from 1,000 to 1,000,000 nodes.\n  We find significant differences among the results of the different cluster\nquality metrics. For example, clustering algorithms can return a value of 0.4\nout of 1 on modularity but score 0 out of 1 on information recovery. We find\nconductance, though imperfect, to be the stand-alone quality metric that best\nindicates performance on information recovery metrics. Our study shows that the\nvariant of normalized mutual information used in previous work cannot be\nassumed to differ only slightly from traditional normalized mutual information.\n  Smart local moving is the best performing algorithm in our study, but\ndiscrepancies between cluster evaluation metrics prevent us from declaring it\nabsolutely superior.

The main focus is on the\nconcept of centrality, which is used to investigate the embeddedness of firms\nfrom a particular country within the global network. The study results in three\ncontributions. First, to the best of our knowledge for the first time we can\ninvestigate the topology as well as the concept of centrality in corporate\nnetworks at a global scale, allowing for the largest cross-country comparison\never done in interlocking directorates literature. We demonstrate, amongst\nother things, extremely similar network topologies, yet large differences\nbetween countries when it comes to the relation between economic prominence\nindicators and firm centrality. Second, we introduce two new metrics that are\nspecifically suitable for comparing the centrality ranking of a partition to\nthat of the full network. Using the notion of centrality persistence we propose\nto measure the persistence of a partition's centrality ranking in the full\nnetwork. In the board interlock network, it allows us to assess the extent to\nwhich the footprint of a national network is still present within the global\nnetwork. Next, the measure of centrality ranking dominance tells us whether a\npartition (country) is more dominant at the top or the bottom of the centrality\nranking of the full (global) network. Finally, comparing these two new measures\nof persistence and dominance between different countries allows us to classify\nthese countries based the their embeddedness, measured using the relation\nbetween the centrality of a country's firms on the national and the global\nscale of the board interlock network. \n\n"}

Recently, Android 6\noverhauled the way permissions are granted by users, by switching to run-time\npermission requests instead of install-time permission requests. This is a\nwelcome change, but recent research has shown that many users continue to\naccept run-time permissions blindly, leaving them at the mercy of third-party\napp developers and adversaries. Beyond intentionally invading privacy, highly\nprivileged apps increase the attack surface of smartphones and are more\nattractive targets for adversaries.

Recently, roboticists have responded by initiating\nthe development of so-called ethical robots. These robots would, ideally,\nevaluate the consequences of their actions and morally justify their choices.\nThis emerging field promises to develop extensively over the next years.\nHowever, in this paper, we point out an inherent limitation of the emerging\nfield of ethical robots. We show that building ethical robots also necessarily\nfacilitates the construction of unethical robots. In three experiments, we show\nthat it is remarkably easy to modify an ethical robot so that it behaves\ncompetitively, or even aggressively. The reason for this is that the specific\nAI, required to make an ethical robot, can always be exploited to make\nunethical robots. Hence, the development of ethical robots will not guarantee\nthe responsible deployment of AI. While advocating for ethical robots, we\nconclude that preventing the misuse of robots is beyond the scope of\nengineering, and requires instead governance frameworks underpinned by\nlegislation. Without this, the development of ethical robots will serve to\nincrease the risks of robotic malpractice instead of diminishing it. \n\n"}

In the present paper we propose an algorithm to obtain\nstatistically-validated projections of bipartite networks, according to which\nany two nodes sharing a statistically-significant number of neighbors are\nlinked.

The model is intended to understand diffusion of influence, or any\nother spreading process implying a threshold dynamics, in setups of\ninterconnected networks with significant clustering. The contagion is assumed\nto be general enough to account for a content-dependent linear threshold model,\nwhere each link type has a different weight (for spreading influence) that may\ndepend on the content (e.g., product, rumor, political view) that is being\nspread. Using the generating functions formalism, we determine the conditions,\nprobability, and expected size of the emergent global cascades. This analysis\nprovides a generalization of previous approaches and is specially useful in\nproblems related to spreading and percolation.

However, the self-healing ability emerges as a valuable opportunity\nwhere the overlaying cyber network can cure failures in the underlying physical\nnetwork. To capture both self-healing and contagion, this paper considers a\ngraphical model representation of an interdependent cyber-physical system, in\nwhich nodes represent various cyber or physical functionalities, and edges\ncapture the interactions between the nodes. A message-passing algorithm is\nproposed for this representation to study the dynamics of failure propagation\nand healing.

It is proved that as\nthe number of message-passing iterations increases, the network reaches a\nsteady-state condition that would be either a complete healing or a complete\ncollapse. Then, a sufficient condition is derived to select the network\nparameters to guarantee the complete healing of the system.

More recently, it has been found that the\nknowledge of the degree sequence can be replaced by the knowledge of the\nstrength sequence, which is typically accessible, complemented by that of the\ntotal number of links, thus considerably relaxing the observational\nrequirements. Here we further relax these requirements and devise a procedure\nvalid when even the the total number of links is unavailable. We assume that,\napart from the heterogeneity induced by the degree sequence itself, the network\nis homogeneous, so that its (global) link density can be estimated by sampling\nsubsets of nodes with representative density. We show that the best way of\nsampling nodes is the random selection scheme, any other procedure being biased\ntowards unrealistically large, or small, link densities. We then introduce our\ncore technique for reconstructing both the topology and the link weights of the\nunknown network in detail. When tested on real economic and financial data\nsets, our method achieves a remarkable accuracy and is very robust with respect\nto the sampled subsets, thus representing a reliable practical tool whenever\nthe available topological information is restricted to small portions of nodes. \n\n"}

This occurs presumably because networks\nrepresenting similar purposes or constructions would be expected to be\ngenerated by a shared set of domain specific mechanisms, and it should\ntherefore be possible to classify these networks into categories based on their\nfeatures at various structural levels. Here we describe and demonstrate a new,\nhybrid approach that combines manual selection of features of potential\ninterest with existing automated classification methods.

As a result of the projection, nodes of the same set are linked together\nif they have at least one neighbor in common in the bipartite network. Even\nthough these projections allow one to study bipartite networks using tools\ndeveloped for unipartite networks, one-mode projections lead to significant\nloss of information and artificial inflation of the projected network with\nfully connected subgraphs. Here we pursue a different approach for analyzing\nbipartite systems that is based on the observation that such systems have a\nlatent metric structure: network nodes are points in a latent metric space,\nwhile connections are more likely to form between nodes separated by shorter\ndistances. This approach has been developed for unipartite networks, and\nrelatively little is known about its applicability to bipartite systems.

When such issues emerge on social media, we\noften observe the creation of 'echo chambers', i.e., situations where\nlike-minded people reinforce each other's opinion, but do not get exposed to\nthe views of the opposing side. In this paper we study algorithmic techniques\nfor bridging these chambers, and thus, reducing controversy. Specifically, we\nrepresent the discussion on a controversial issue with an endorsement graph,\nand cast our problem as an edge-recommendation problem on this graph. The goal\nof the recommendation is to reduce the controversy score of the graph, which is\nmeasured by a recently-developed metric based on random walks. At the same\ntime, we take into account the acceptance probability of the recommended edge,\nwhich represents how likely the edge is to materialize in the endorsement\ngraph. We propose a simple model based on a recently-developed user-level\ncontroversy score, that is competitive with state-of- the-art link-prediction\nalgorithms.

A direct proportionality exists between the\ndistance and the selectable paths towards local minimums; where by getting\nclose to the final steps there is no other way but the one to the jammed\nstates. \n\n"}

However,\nthis is in most cases an ill-posed problem, as the affiliation of a node to a\nsingle community is often ambiguous. Previous solutions have attempted to\nidentify all of the communities to which each node affiliates. Instead of\ntaking this approach, we introduce versatility, $V$, as a novel metric of nodal\naffiliation: $V \\sim 0$ means that a node is consistently assigned to a\nspecific community; $V \\gg 0$ means it is inconsistently assigned to different\ncommunities. Versatility works in conjunction with existing community detection\nalgorithms, and it satisfies many theoretically desirable properties in\nidealised networks designed to maximise ambiguity of modular decomposition. The\nlocal minima of global mean versatility identified the resolution parameters of\na hierarchical community detection algorithm that least ambiguously decomposed\nthe community structure of a social (karate club) network and the mouse brain\nconnectome.

In fact, misinformation easily spreads on OSN and is a huge threat for\nmodern society, possibly influencing also the outcome of elections, or even\nputting people's life at risk (e.g., spreading \"anti-vaccines\" misinformation).\nTherefore, it is of paramount importance for our society to have some sort of\n\"validation\" on information spreading through OSN.

To mitigate such disparities, several\ntechniques recently have been proposed to achieve algorithmic fairness.

NA is applicable to many fields, including\ncomputational biology, where NA can guide the transfer of biological knowledge\nfrom well- to poorly-studied species across aligned network regions. Existing\nNA methods can only align static networks. However, most complex real-world\nsystems evolve over time and should thus be modeled as dynamic networks. We\nhypothesize that aligning dynamic network representations of evolving systems\nwill produce superior alignments compared to aligning the systems' static\nnetwork representations, as is currently done. For this purpose, we introduce\nthe first ever dynamic NA method, DynaMAGNA++. This proof-of-concept dynamic NA\nmethod is an extension of a state-of-the-art static NA method, MAGNA++. Even\nthough both MAGNA++ and DynaMAGNA++ optimize edge as well as node conservation\nacross the aligned networks, MAGNA++ conserves static edges and similarity\nbetween static node neighborhoods, while DynaMAGNA++ conserves dynamic edges\n(events) and similarity between evolving node neighborhoods.

We consider the special\ncase of networks (i) where we have one attribute with two values (e.g., male\nand female in the case of gender), (ii) where the size of the two groups is\nunequal (e.g., a male majority and a female minority), and (iii) where nodes\nwith the same or different attribute value attract or repel each other (i.e.,\nhomophilic or heterophilic behavior).

First, as\nconventions evolve, the underlying substance of their meaning tends to change\nas well; and such substantive changes confound investigations of social\neffects. Second, the selection of a convention takes place through the complex\ninteractions of individuals within a community, and contention between the\nusers of competing conventions plays a key role in the convention's evolution.\nAny analysis must take place in the presence of these two issues.\n  In this work we study a setting in which we can cleanly track the competition\namong conventions.

They have opinions about certain\ntopics, which they share and spread on these networks, and are influenced by\nthe opinions of other persons. In this paper, we build upon this observation to\npropose a new nodal centrality measure for multiplex networks. Our measure,\ncalled Opinion centrality, is based on a stochastic model representing opinion\npropagation dynamics in such a network. We formulate an optimization problem\nconsisting in maximizing the opinion of the whole network when controlling an\nexternal influence able to affect each node individually. We find a\nmathematical closed form of this problem, and use its solution to derive our\ncentrality measure. According to the opinion centrality, the more a node is\nworth investing external influence, and the more it is central. We perform an\nempirical study of the proposed centrality over a toy network, as well as a\ncollection of real-world networks. Our measure is generally negatively\ncorrelated with existing multiplex centrality measures, and highlights\ndifferent types of nodes, accordingly to its definition. \n\n"}

These data sets often contain\nindirect localisation information, such as historical addresses. Historical\ngeocoding is the process of transforming the indirect localisation information\nto direct localisation that can be placed on a map, which enables spatial\nanalysis and cross-referencing. Many efficient geocoders exist for current\naddresses, but they do not deal with the temporal aspect and are based on a\nstrict hierarchy (..., city, street, house number) that is hard or impossible\nto use with historical data. Indeed historical data are full of uncertainties\n(temporal aspect, semantic aspect, spatial precision, confidence in historical\nsource, ...) that can not be resolved, as there is no way to go back in time to\ncheck. We propose an open source, open data, extensible solution for geocoding\nthat is based on the building of gazetteers composed of geohistorical objects\nextracted from historical topographical maps. Once the gazetteers are\navailable, geocoding an historical address is a matter of finding the\ngeohistorical object in the gazetteers that is the best match to the historical\naddress. The matching criteriae are customisable and include several dimensions\n(fuzzy semantic, fuzzy temporal, scale, spatial precision ...). As the goal is\nto facilitate historical work, we also propose web-based user interfaces that\nhelp geocode (one address or batch mode) and display over current or historical\ntopographical maps, so that they can be checked and collaboratively edited.

Due to its low cost,\nsampling via a random walk (RW) has been proposed as an attractive solution to\nthis task. Most RW methods assume either that the network is undirected or that\nwalkers can traverse edges regardless of their direction. Some RW methods have\nbeen designed for directed networks where edges coming into a node are not\ndirectly observable. In this work, we propose Directed Unbiased Frontier\nSampling (DUFS), a sampling method based on a large number of coordinated\nwalkers, each starting from a node chosen uniformly at random. It is applicable\nto directed networks with invisible incoming edges because it constructs, in\nreal-time, an undirected graph consistent with the walkers trajectories, and\ndue to the use of random jumps which prevent walkers from being trapped. DUFS\ngeneralizes previous RW methods and is suited for undirected networks and to\ndirected networks regardless of in-edges visibility. We also propose an\nimproved estimator of node label distributions that combines information from\nthe initial walker locations with subsequent RW observations. We evaluate DUFS,\ncompare it to other RW methods, investigate the impact of its parameters on\nestimation accuracy and provide practical guidelines for choosing them. In\nestimating out-degree distributions, DUFS yields significantly better estimates\nof the head of the distribution than other methods, while matching or exceeding\nestimation accuracy of the tail. Last, we show that DUFS outperforms uniform\nnode sampling when estimating distributions of node labels of the top 10%\nlargest degree nodes, even when sampling a node uniformly has the same cost as\nRW steps. \n\n"}

This learning process appears in settings in which each\nindividual in a group is trying to decide over time, in a distributed manner,\nwhich option to select among a shared set of options. Specifically, we consider\na stochastic dynamics in a group in which every individual selects an option in\nthe following two-step process: (1) select a random individual and observe the\noption that individual chose in the previous time step, and (2) adopt that\noption if its stochastic quality was good at that time step. Various\ninstantiations of such distributed learning appear in nature, and have also\nbeen studied in the social science literature. From the perspective of an\nindividual, an attractive feature of this learning process is that it is a\nsimple heuristic that requires extremely limited computational capacities. But\nwhat does it mean for the group -- could such a simple, distributed and\nessentially memoryless process lead the group as a whole to perform optimally?\nWe show that the answer to this question is yes -- this distributed learning is\nhighly effective at identifying the best option and is close to optimal for the\ngroup overall. Our analysis also gives quantitative bounds that show fast\nconvergence of these stochastic dynamics. Prior to our work the only\ntheoretical work related to such learning dynamics has been either in\ndeterministic special cases or in the asymptotic setting. Finally, we observe\nthat our infinite population dynamics is a stochastic variant of the classic\nmultiplicative weights update (MWU) method. Consequently, we arrive at the\nfollowing interesting converse: the learning dynamics on a finite population\nconsidered here can be viewed as a novel distributed and low-memory\nimplementation of the classic MWU method. \n\n"}

Whilst originally\nused by commercial airliners to track their flights and provide automated\ntimekeeping on crew, today it serves as a multi-purpose air-ground data link\nfor many aviation stakeholders including private jet owners, state actors and\nmilitary. Since ACARS messages are still mostly sent in the clear over a\nwireless channel, any sensitive information sent with ACARS can potentially\nlead to a privacy breach for users. Naturally, different stakeholders consider\ndifferent types of data sensitive. In this paper we propose a privacy framework\nmatching aviation stakeholders to a range of sensitive information types and\nassess the impact for each. Based on more than one million ACARS messages,\ncollected over several months, we then demonstrate that current ACARS usage\nsystematically breaches privacy for all stakeholder groups. We further support\nour findings with a number of cases of significant privacy issues for each\ngroup and analyze the impact of such leaks. While it is well-known that ACARS\nmessages are susceptible to eavesdropping attacks, this work is the first to\nquantify the extent and impact of privacy leakage in the real world for the\nrelevant aviation stakeholders. \n\n"}

This positive thrust\nhowever is faced with several delaying factors, one of which is the volatility\nand unpredictability of the potential benefit (or utilization) of ride-sharing\nat different times, and in different places. In this work the following\nresearch questions are posed: (a) Is ride-sharing utilization stable over time\nor does it undergo significant changes? (b) If ride-sharing utilization is\ndynamic, can it be correlated with some traceable features of the traffic? and\n(c) If ride-sharing utilization is dynamic, can it be predicted ahead of time?\nWe analyze a dataset of over 14 Million taxi trips taken in New York City. We\npropose a dynamic travel network approach for modeling and forecasting the\npotential ride-sharing utilization over time, showing it to be highly volatile.\nIn order to model the utilization's dynamics we propose a network-centric\napproach, projecting the aggregated traffic taken from continuous time periods\ninto a feature space comprised of topological features of the network implied\nby this traffic. This feature space is then used to model the dynamics of\nride-sharing utilization over time. The results of our analysis demonstrate the\nsignificant volatility of ride-sharing utilization over time, indicating that\nany policy, design or plan that would disregard this aspect and chose a static\nparadigm would undoubtably be either highly inefficient or provide insufficient\nresources.

{"id": "1706.04252", "contents": "Title: Complex Contagions with Timers Abstract: A great deal of effort has gone into trying to model social influence ---\nincluding the spread of behavior, norms, and ideas --- on networks. Most models\nof social influence tend to assume that individuals react to changes in the\nstates of their neighbors without any time delay, but this is often not true in\nsocial contexts, where (for various reasons) different agents can have\ndifferent response times. To examine such situations, we introduce the idea of\na timer into threshold models of social influence. The presence of timers on\nnodes delays the adoption --- i.e., change of state --- of each agent, which in\nturn delays the adoptions of its neighbors. With a homogeneous-distributed\ntimer, in which all nodes exhibit the same amount of delay, adoption delays are\nalso homogeneous, so the adoption order of nodes remains the same. However,\nheterogeneously-distributed timers can change the adoption order of nodes and\nhence the \"adoption paths\" through which state changes spread in a network.\nUsing a threshold model of social contagions, we illustrate that heterogeneous\ntimers can either accelerate or decelerate the spread of adoptions compared to\nan analogous situation with homogeneous timers, and we investigate the\nrelationship of such acceleration or deceleration with respect to timer\ndistribution and network structure. We derive an analytical approximation for\nthe temporal evolution of the fraction of adopters by modifying a pair\napproximation of the Watts threshold model, and we find good agreement with\nnumerical computations.

In\nthis paper, we explore how \\textit{anti-establishment} nodes (e.g.,\n\\textit{hipsters}) influence the spreading dynamics of two competing products.\nWe consider a model in which spreading follows a deterministic rule for\nupdating node states (which describe which product has been adopted) in which\nan adjustable fraction $p_{\\rm Hip}$ of the nodes in a network are hipsters,\nwho choose to adopt the product that they believe is the less popular of the\ntwo. The remaining nodes are conformists, who choose which product to adopt by\nconsidering which products their immediate neighbors have adopted. We simulate\nour model on both synthetic and real networks, and we show that the hipsters\nhave a major effect on the final fraction of people who adopt each product:\neven when only one of the two products exists at the beginning of the\nsimulations, a very small fraction of hipsters in a network can still cause the\nother product to eventually become the more popular one. To account for this\nbehavior, we construct an approximation for the steady-state adoption fraction\non $k$-regular trees in the limit of few hipsters. Additionally, our\nsimulations demonstrate that a time delay $\\tau$ in the knowledge of the\nproduct distribution in a population, as compared to immediate knowledge of\nproduct adoption among nearest neighbors, can have a large effect on the final\ndistribution of product adoptions. Our simple model and analysis may help shed\nlight on the road to success for anti-establishment choices in elections, as\nsuch success can arise rather generically in our model from a small number of\nanti-establishment individuals and ordinary processes of social influence on\nnormal individuals. \n\n"}

During brief time periods users often use a single communication\nchannel, but then communication channel alteration (CCA) occurs. This means\nthat we must refine our understanding of the dynamics of social contagions. We\npropose a non-Markovian behavior spreading model in multiplex networks that\ntakes into account the CCA mechanism, and we develop a generalized edge-based\ncompartmental method to describe the spreading dynamics. Through extensive\nnumerical simulations and theoretical analyses we find that the time delays\ninduced by CCA slow the behavior spreading but do not affect the final adoption\nsize. We also find that the CCA suppresses behavior spreading. On two coupled\nrandom regular networks, the adoption size exhibits hybrid growth, i.e., it\ngrows first continuously and then discontinuously with the information\ntransmission probability. CCA in ER-SF multiplex networks in which two\nsubnetworks are Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi (ER) and scale-free (SF) introduces a\ncrossover from continuous to hybrid growth in adoption size versus information\ntransmission probability.

However, engineering such\nnext-step hints manually or via an expert model becomes infeasible if the space\nof possible states is too large. Therefore, several approaches have emerged to\ninfer next-step hints automatically, relying on past students' data. In\nparticular, the Hint Factory (Barnes & Stamper, 2008) recommends edits that are\nmost likely to guide students from their current state towards a correct\nsolution, based on what successful students in the past have done in the same\nsituation. Still, the Hint Factory relies on student data being available for\nany state a student might visit while solving the task, which is not the case\nfor some learning tasks, such as open-ended programming tasks. In this\ncontribution we provide a mathematical framework for edit-based hint policies\nand, based on this theory, propose a novel hint policy to provide edit hints in\nvast and sparsely populated state spaces. In particular, we extend the Hint\nFactory by considering data of past students in all states which are similar to\nthe student's current state and creating hints approximating the weighted\naverage of all these reference states. Because the space of possible weighted\naverages is continuous, we call this approach the Continuous Hint Factory. In\nour experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that the Continuous Hint Factory\ncan predict more accurately what capable students would do compared to existing\nprediction schemes on two learning tasks, especially in an open-ended\nprogramming task, and that the Continuous Hint Factory is comparable to\nexisting hint policies at reproducing tutor hints on a simple UML diagram task. \n\n"}

Traditional methods for clickbait detection\nhave relied heavily on feature engineering which, in turn, is dependent on the\ndataset it is built for. The application of neural networks for this task has\nonly been explored partially. We propose a novel approach considering all\ninformation found in a social media post.

For\nexample, university students connect in intermittent groups that repeatedly\nform and dissolve based on multiple factors, including their lectures,\ninterests, and friends. Such dynamic systems can be represented as multilayer\nnetworks where each layer represents a snapshot of the temporal network. In\nthis representation, it is crucial that the links between layers accurately\ncapture real dependencies between those layers. Often, however, these\ndependencies are unknown. Therefore, current methods connect layers based on\nsimplistic assumptions that do not capture node-level layer dependencies. For\nexample, connecting every node to itself in other layers with the same weight\ncan wipe out dependencies between intermittent groups, making it difficult or\neven impossible to identify them.

Consequently, there is a tremendous effort in order to\ndevelop efficient community detection algorithms. Unfortunately, the issue of a\nfair assessment of these algorithms is a thriving open question. If the\nground-truth community structure is available, various clustering-based metrics\nare used in order to compare it versus the one discovered by these algorithms.\nHowever, these metrics defined at the node level are fairly insensitive to the\nvariation of the overall community structure. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose to exploit the topological features of the 'community graphs' (where\nthe nodes are the communities and the links represent their interactions) in\norder to evaluate the algorithms. To illustrate our methodology, we conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of overlapping community detection algorithms using a\nset of real-world networks with known a priori community structure. Results\nprovide a better perception of their relative performance as compared to\nclassical metrics. Moreover, they show that more emphasis should be put on the\ntopology of the community structure. We also investigate the relationship\nbetween the topological properties of the community structure and the\nalternative evaluation measures (quality metrics and clustering metrics). It\nappears clearly that they present different views of the community structure\nand that they must be combined in order to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncommunity detection algorithms. \n\n"}

The present method requires that a quality of each\ncommunity can be quantified and that community detection is performed as\noptimisation of such a quality function summed over the communities.

Abstract: Technological advances have led to a strong increase in the number of data\ncollection efforts aimed at measuring co-presence of individuals at different\nspatial resolutions. It is however unclear how much co-presence data can inform\nus on actual face-to-face contacts, of particular interest to study the\nstructure of a population in social groups or for use in data-driven models of\ninformation or epidemic spreading processes. Here, we address this issue by\nleveraging data sets containing high resolution face-to-face contacts as well\nas a coarser spatial localisation of individuals, both temporally resolved, in\nvarious contexts. The co-presence and the face-to-face contact temporal\nnetworks share a number of structural and statistical features, but the former\nis (by definition) much denser than the latter. We thus consider several\ndown-sampling methods that generate surrogate contact networks from the\nco-presence signal and compare them with the real face-to-face data. We show\nthat these surrogate networks reproduce some features of the real data but are\nonly partially able to identify the most central nodes of the face-to-face\nnetwork.

As a response, a number of criteria for implementing algorithmic\nfairness in machine learning have been developed in the literature. This paper\nproposes the Continuous Fairness Algorithm (CFA$\\theta$) which enables a\ncontinuous interpolation between different fairness definitions. More\nspecifically, we make three main contributions to the existing literature.\nFirst, our approach allows the decision maker to continuously vary between\nspecific concepts of individual and group fairness. As a consequence, the\nalgorithm enables the decision maker to adopt intermediate ``worldviews'' on\nthe degree of discrimination encoded in algorithmic processes, adding nuance to\nthe extreme cases of ``we're all equal'' (WAE) and ``what you see is what you\nget'' (WYSIWYG) proposed so far in the literature. Second, we use optimal\ntransport theory, and specifically the concept of the barycenter, to maximize\ndecision maker utility under the chosen fairness constraints. Third, the\nalgorithm is able to handle cases of intersectionality, i.e., of\nmulti-dimensional discrimination of certain groups on grounds of several\ncriteria. We discuss three main examples (credit applications; college\nadmissions; insurance contracts) and map out the legal and policy implications\nof our approach.

(The risk-limiting audits proposed by\nStark are \"frequentist\" rather than Bayesian in character.)\n  We first provide a simplified presentation of Bayesian tabulation audits. A\nBayesian tabulation audit begins by drawing a random sample of the votes in\nthat contest, and tallying those votes. It then considers what effect\nstatistical variations of this tally have on the contest outcome. If such\nvariations almost always yield the previously-reported outcome, the audit\nterminates, accepting the reported outcome. Otherwise the audit is repeated\nwith an enlarged sample.\n  Bayesian audits are attractive because they work with any method for\ndetermining the winner (such as ranked-choice voting).\n  We then show how Bayesian audits may be extended to handle more complex\nsituations, such as auditing contests that \\emph{span multiple jurisdictions},\nor are otherwise \"stratified.\"\n  We highlight the auditing of such multiple-jurisdiction contests where some\nof the jurisdictions have an electronic cast vote record (CVR) for each cast\npaper vote, while the others do not.

However,\na major limitation of previous methods is that the indicators are obtained from\nonly a single source whose reliability might be low, or from several data\nsources but their interactions and correlations among the multi-sourced data\nare largely ignored.\n  In this work, we extract the events from Web news and the users' sentiments\nfrom social media, and investigate their joint impacts on the stock price\nmovements via a coupled matrix and tensor factorization framework.\nSpecifically, a tensor is firstly constructed to fuse heterogeneous data and\ncapture the intrinsic relations among the events and the investors' sentiments.\nDue to the sparsity of the tensor, two auxiliary matrices, the stock\nquantitative feature matrix and the stock correlation matrix, are constructed\nand incorporated to assist the tensor decomposition. The intuition behind is\nthat stocks that are highly correlated with each other tend to be affected by\nthe same event.

In this paper, we introduce a novel\nprobabilistic approach for the sign prediction problem. The main characteristic\nof the proposed models is their ability to adapt to the sparsity level of an\ninput network. The sparsity of networks is one of the major reasons for the\npoor performance of many link prediction algorithms, in general, and sign\nprediction algorithms, in particular. Building a model that has an ability to\nadapt to the sparsity of the data has not yet been considered in the previous\nrelated works. We suggest that there exists a dilemma between local and global\nstructures and attempt to build sparsity adaptive models by resolving this\ndilemma. To this end, we propose probabilistic prediction models based on local\nand global structures and integrate them based on the concept of smoothing. The\nmodel relies more on the global structures when the sparsity increases, whereas\nit gives more weights to the information obtained from local structures for low\nlevels of the sparsity. The proposed model is assessed on three real-world\nsigned networks, and the experiments reveal its consistent superiority over the\nstate of the art methods. As compared to the previous methods, the proposed\nmodel not only better handles the sparsity problem, but also has lower\ncomputational complexity and can be updated using real-time data streams. \n\n"}

Location-privacy preserving mechanisms, such as obfuscation,\nanonymization and cryptographic primitives, have been shown to have impractical\nutility/privacy tradeoff. Another solution for enhancing user privacy is to\nminimize data sharing by executing the tasks conventionally carried out at the\nservice providers' end on the users' smartphones. Although the data volume\nshared with the untrusted entities is significantly reduced, executing\ncomputationally demanding server-side tasks on resource-constrained smartphones\nis often impracticable. To this end, we propose a novel perspective on lowering\nthe computational complexity by treating spatiotemporal trajectories as\nspace-time signals. Lowering the data dimensionality facilitates offloading the\ncomputational tasks onto the digital-signal processors and the usage of the\nnon-blocking signal-processing pipelines.

Most prior works on algorithmic fairness\nnormatively prescribe how fair decisions ought to be made.

For\ngenerating random matrices that are appropriate as a structureless reference,\nwe propose a null model that enforces, on average, the empirical occurrence\nfrequency of each possible trait. With respect to this null model, the\nempirical matrices show deviating eigenvalues, which may be signatures of\nsubtle cultural groups. However, they can conceivably also be artifacts of\narbitrary redundancies between cultural variables. We first study this\npossibility in a highly simplified setting, using a toy model that enforces a\ncertain level of redundancy in a minimally-biased way, in parallel with another\ntoy model that enforces group structure. By analyzing and comparing cultural\nstates generated with these toy models, we show that a deviating eigenvalue can\nindeed be a redundancy signature, which can be distinguished from a grouping\nsignature by evaluating the uniformity of the entries of the respective\neigenvector, as well as the uniformity-based compatibility with the null model.\nFor empirical data, the eigenvector uniformities of all deviating eigenvalues\nare shown to be compatible with the null model, apparently suggesting that we\nare not dealing with genuine group structure.

They face shortcomings to\ncollect and annotate hateful speech due to the incompleteness and noisiness of\nOSN text and the subjectivity of hate speech. These limitations are often aided\nwith constraints that oversimplify the problem, such as considering only tweets\ncontaining hate-related words. In this work we partially address these issues\nby shifting the focus towards \\textit{users}. We develop and employ a robust\nmethodology to collect and annotate hateful users which does not depend\ndirectly on lexicon and where the users are annotated given their entire\nprofile. This results in a sample of Twitter's retweet graph containing\n$100,386$ users, out of which $4,972$ were annotated. We also collect the users\nwho were banned in the three months that followed the data collection. We show\nthat hateful users differ from normal ones in terms of their activity patterns,\nword usage and as well as network structure. We obtain similar results\ncomparing the neighbors of hateful vs. neighbors of normal users and also\nsuspended users vs. active users, increasing the robustness of our analysis. We\nobserve that hateful users are densely connected, and thus formulate the hate\nspeech detection problem as a task of semi-supervised learning over a graph,\nexploiting the network of connections on Twitter. We find that a node embedding\nalgorithm, which exploits the graph structure, outperforms content-based\napproaches for the detection of both hateful ($95\\%$ AUC vs $88\\%$ AUC) and\nsuspended users ($93\\%$ AUC vs $88\\%$ AUC). Altogether, we present a\nuser-centric view of hate speech, paving the way for better detection and\nunderstanding of this relevant and challenging issue. \n\n"}

While social media and sharing\ninformation about children (so-called \"sharenting\") have become an integral\npart of parenthood, it is not well-known if and how gender preference shapes\nonline behavior of users.

A common prerequisite in network analysis is that information on\nnodes and links will be complete because network topologies are extremely\nsensitive to missing information of this kind. Therefore, many real-world\nnetworks that fail to meet this criterion under random sampling may be\ndiscarded.\n  In this paper we offer a framework for interpreting the missing observations\nin network data under the hypothesis that these observations are not missing at\nrandom. We demonstrate the methodology with a case study of a financial trade\nnetwork, where the awareness of agents to the data collection procedure by a\nself-interested observer may result in strategic revealing or withholding of\ninformation. The non-random missingness has been overlooked despite the\npossibility of this being an important feature of the processes by which the\nnetwork is generated. The analysis demonstrates that strategic information\nwithholding may be a valid general phenomenon in complex systems.

An information network can be viewed as\na linked structure of a set of entities. A set of linked web pages and\ndocuments, a set of users in a social network are common examples of\ninformation network. Network embedding learns low dimensional representations\nof the nodes, which can further be used for downstream network mining\napplications such as community detection or node clustering. Information\nnetwork representation techniques traditionally use only the link structure of\nthe network. But in real world networks, nodes come with additional content\nsuch as textual descriptions or associated images.

However, convincing US courts to adopt specific measures to\nquantify gerrymandering has been of limited success to date. Recently,\nStephanopoulos and McGhee introduced a new and precise measure of partisan\ngerrymandering via the so-called \"efficiency gap\" that computes the absolutes\ndifference of wasted votes between two political parties in a two-party system.\nQuite importantly from a legal point of view, this measure was found legally\nconvincing enough in a US appeals court in a case that claims that the\nlegislative map of the state of Wisconsin was gerrymandered; the case is now\npending in US Supreme Court. In this article, we show the following:\n  (a) We provide interesting mathematical and computational complexity\nproperties of the problem of minimizing the efficiency gap measure. To the best\nof our knowledge, these are the first non-trivial theoretical and algorithmic\nanalyses of this measure of gerrymandering.\n  (b) We provide a simple and fast algorithm that can \"un-gerrymander\" the\ndistrict maps for the states of Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by\nbring their efficiency gaps to acceptable levels from the current unacceptable\nlevels.

We find that content copying occurs more frequently\nbetween like-audience sources (eg. alternative news, mainstream news, etc.),\nbut there consistently exists sparse connections between these communities. We\nalso find that despite articles being verbatim, the headlines are often\nchanged. Specifically, we find that mainstream sources change more structural\nfeatures, while alternative sources change many more content features, often\nchanging the emotional tone and bias of the titles. We conclude that content\nrepublishing networks can help identify and label the intent of brand-new news\nsources using the tight-knit community they belong to. In addition, it is\npossible to use the network to find important content producers in each\ncommunity, producers that are used to amplify messages of other sources, and\nproducers that distort the messages of other sources. \n\n"}

Thus, the detection of\nthese communities may be aided through the incorporation of measures of the\nlocal \"richness\" of the cyclic structure. In this paper, we introduce renewal\nnon-backtracking random walks (RNBRW) as a way of quantifying this structure.\nRNBRW gives a weight to each edge equal to the probability that a\nnon-backtracking random walk completes a cycle with that edge. Hence, edges\nwith larger weights may be thought of as more important to the formation of\ncycles. Of note, since separate random walks can be performed in parallel,\nRNBRW weights can be estimated very quickly, even for large graphs. We give\nsimulation results showing that pre-weighting edges through RNBRW may\nsubstantially improve the performance of common community detection algorithms.\nOur results suggest that RNBRW is especially efficient for the challenging case\nof detecting communities in sparse graphs. \n\n"}

Centrality is a measure of the importance of the nodes in a network\nand it plays a crucial role in a huge number of fields, ranging from sociology\nto engineering, and from biology to economics. Many metrics are available to\nevaluate centrality. However, centrality measures are generally based on ad hoc\nassumptions, and there is no commonly accepted way to compare the effectiveness\nand reliability of different metrics. Here we propose a new perspective where\ncentrality definition arises naturally from the most basic feature of a\nnetwork, its adjacency matrix. Following this perspective, different centrality\nmeasures naturally emerge, including the degree, eigenvector, and hub-authority\ncentrality. Within this theoretical framework, the accuracy of different\nmetrics can be compared. Tests on a large set of networks show that the\nstandard centrality metrics perform unsatisfactorily, highlighting intrinsic\nlimitations of these metrics for describing the centrality of nodes in complex\nnetworks.

Vehicles can use smart city data for\ndecision-making, such as dynamic routing based on traffic conditions. Moreover,\nthe multitude of embedded sensors in vehicles can collectively produce a rich\ndata set of the urban landscape that can be used to provide a range of\nservices. Key to the success of this vision is a scalable and private\narchitecture for trusted data sharing. This paper proposes a framework called\nSpeedyChain, that leverages blockchain technology to allow smart vehicles to\nshare their data while maintaining privacy, integrity, resilience and\nnon-repudiation in a decentralized, and tamper-resistant manner. Differently\nfrom traditional blockchain usage (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), the proposed\nframework uses a blockchain design that decouples the data stored in the\ntransactions from the block header, thus allowing for fast addition of data to\nthe blocks. Furthermore, an expiration time for each block to avoid large sized\nblocks is proposed.

Recent studies either failed to capture\ncombinatorial effects on differential prediction or primarily only focused on\ncell type-specific analysis. In this paper, we develop a novel attention-based\ndeep learning architecture, DeepDiff, that provides a unified and end-to-end\nsolution to model and to interpret how dependencies among histone modifications\ncontrol the differential patterns of gene regulation. DeepDiff uses a hierarchy\nof multiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the spatial\nstructure of input signals and to model how various histone modifications\ncooperate automatically. We introduce and train two levels of attention jointly\nwith the target prediction, enabling DeepDiff to attend differentially to\nrelevant modifications and to locate important genome positions for each\nmodification. Additionally, DeepDiff introduces a novel deep-learning based\nmulti-task formulation to use the cell-type-specific gene expression\npredictions as auxiliary tasks, encouraging richer feature embeddings in our\nprimary task of differential expression prediction.

The systematic study of these two features of social\nsystems has started only very recently mainly thanks to the development of\nmultiplex and time-varying networks. However, these two advancements have\nprogressed almost in parallel with very little overlap. Thus, the interplay\nbetween multiplexity and the temporal nature of connectivity patterns is poorly\nunderstood. Here, we aim to tackle this limitation by introducing a\ntime-varying model of multiplex networks. We are interested in characterizing\nhow these two properties affect contagion processes. To this end, we study SIS\nepidemic models unfolding at comparable time-scale respect to the evolution of\nthe multiplex network. We study both analytically and numerically the epidemic\nthreshold as a function of the overlap between, and the features of, each\nlayer. We found that, the overlap between layers significantly reduces the\nepidemic threshold especially when the temporal activation patterns of\noverlapping nodes are positively correlated. Furthermore, when the average\nconnectivity across layers is very different, the contagion dynamics are driven\nby the features of the more densely connected layer. Here, the epidemic\nthreshold is equivalent to that of a single layered graph and the impact of the\ndisease, in the layer driving the contagion, is independent of the overlap.\nHowever, this is not the case in the other layers where the spreading dynamics\nare sharply influenced by it.

We generalize the\nweighted social network model such that the nodes or individuals have $F$\nfeatures and each feature can have $q$ different values. Here the tendency for\nthe tie formation between two individuals due to the overlap in their features\nrepresents homophily. We find a phase transition as a function of $F$ or $q$,\nresulting in a phase diagram. For fixed $q$ and as a function of $F$ the system\nshows two phases separated at $F_c$. For $F{<}F_c$ large, homogeneous, and well\nseparated communities can be identified within which the features match almost\nperfectly (segregated phase). When $F$ becomes larger than $F_c$, the nodes\nstart to belong to several communities and within a community the features\nmatch only partially (overlapping phase).

Models of object categorization based on\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved human-level benchmarks in\nassigning known labels to novel images. These advances promise to support\ntransformative technologies such as autonomous vehicles and machine diagnosis;\nbeyond this, they also serve as candidate models for the visual system itself\n-- not only in their output but perhaps even in their underlying mechanisms and\nprinciples. However, unlike human vision, CNNs can be \"fooled\" by adversarial\nexamples -- carefully crafted images that appear as nonsense patterns to humans\nbut are recognized as familiar objects by machines, or that appear as one\nobject to humans and a different object to machines. This seemingly extreme\ndivergence between human and machine classification challenges the promise of\nthese new advances, both as applied image-recognition systems and also as\nmodels of the human mind. Surprisingly, however, little work has empirically\ninvestigated human classification of such adversarial stimuli: Does human and\nmachine performance fundamentally diverge? Or could humans decipher such images\nand predict the machine's preferred labels? Here, we show that human and\nmachine classification of adversarial stimuli are robustly related: In eight\nexperiments on five prominent and diverse adversarial imagesets, human subjects\nreliably identified the machine's chosen label over relevant foils. This\npattern persisted for images with strong antecedent identities, and even for\nimages described as \"totally unrecognizable to human eyes\".

However, to enable a healthy environment for\ninformation sharing, social deliberation, and opinion formation, citizens need\nto be exposed to sufficiently diverse viewpoints that challenge their\nassumptions, instead of being trapped inside filter bubbles. In this paper, we\ntake a step in this direction and propose a novel approach to maximize the\ndiversity of exposure in a social network.

We propose a realistic setting where we take\ninto account content and user leanings, and the probability of further sharing\nan article. This setting allows us to capture the balance between maximizing\nthe spread of information and ensuring the exposure of users to diverse\nviewpoints.\n  The resulting problem can be cast as maximizing a monotone and submodular\nfunction subject to a matroid constraint on the allocation of articles to\nusers.

As a\nresult, two additional features in addition to prediction quality have\ngenerated interest: (i) to facilitate human interaction and understanding with\nthese algorithms, we desire prediction functions that are in some fashion\nsimple or interpretable; and (ii) because they influence consequential\ndecisions, we also want them to produce equitable allocations. We develop a\nformal model to explore the relationship between the demands of simplicity and\nequity. Although the two concepts appear to be motivated by qualitatively\ndistinct goals, we show a fundamental inconsistency between them. Specifically,\nwe formalize a general framework for producing simple prediction functions, and\nin this framework we establish two basic results. First, every simple\nprediction function is strictly improvable: there exists a more complex\nprediction function that is both strictly more efficient and also strictly more\nequitable. Put another way, using a simple prediction function both reduces\nutility for disadvantaged groups and reduces overall welfare relative to other\noptions. Second, we show that simple prediction functions necessarily create\nincentives to use information about individuals' membership in a disadvantaged\ngroup --- incentives that weren't present before simplification, and that work\nagainst these individuals. Thus, simplicity transforms disadvantage into bias\nagainst the disadvantaged group. Our results are not only about algorithms but\nabout any process that produces simple models, and as such they connect to the\npsychology of stereotypes and to an earlier economics literature on statistical\ndiscrimination. \n\n"}

While\nit is common to consider these mechanisms separately or in the frame of a\nstatic model, empirical studies suggest that their dynamic interplay is the\nvery process responsible for the homophilous patterns of association seen in\noff- and online social networks. By combining these two mechanisms in a minimal\nsolvable dynamic model, we confirm theoretically the long-held and empirically\nestablished hypothesis that homophily can be amplified by the triadic closure\nmechanism.

To fill this gap, this paper makes the following\ncontributions: (i) A conceptual architecture of DLT systems with which (ii) a\ntaxonomy is designed and (iii) a rigorous classification of DLT systems is made\nusing real-world data and wisdom of the crowd. (iv) A DLT design guideline is\nthe end result of applying machine learning methodologies on the classification\ndata. Compared to related work and as defined in earlier taxonomy theory, the\nproposed taxonomy is highly comprehensive, robust, explanatory and extensible.\nThe findings of this paper can provide new insights and better understanding of\nthe key design choices evolving the modeling complexity of DLT systems, while\nidentifying opportunities for new research contributions and business\ninnovation. \n\n"}

AVs are a complex system composed of many subsystems,\nmaking them a typical target for attackers. Therefore, the firmware of the\ndifferent subsystems needs to be updated to the latest version by the\nmanufacturer to fix bugs and introduce new features, e.g., using security\npatches. In this paper, we propose a distributed firmware update scheme for the\nAVs' subsystems, leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology. A\nconsortium blockchain made of different AVs manufacturers is used to ensure the\nauthenticity and integrity of firmware updates. Instead of depending on\ncentralized third parties to distribute the new updates, we enable AVs, namely\ndistributors, to participate in the distribution process and we take advantage\nof their mobility to guarantee high availability and fast delivery of the\nupdates. To incentivize AVs to distribute the updates, a reward system is\nestablished that maintains a credit reputation for each distributor account in\nthe blockchain. A zero-knowledge proof protocol is used to exchange the update\nin return for a proof of distribution in a trust-less environment. Moreover, we\nuse attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme to ensure that only authorized AVs\nwill be able to download and use a new update.

Our analysis shows that while a user can hear APs from nearby\nfloors as well as her floor, she will typically only receive signals from\nspatially closer APs in distant floors, as compared to APs in her floor. This\nis due to signal attenuation by floors/ceilings along with the 3D distance\nbetween the APs and the user. Hapi leverages this observation to achieve\naccurate and robust location estimates. A deep-learning based method is\nproposed to identify the user's floor.

AVMs display rich behavior, including a phase\ntransition from a fully-fragmented regime of \"echo-chambers\" to a regime of\npersistent disagreement governed by low-dimensional quasistable manifolds. Many\nextant methods for approximating the behavior of AVMs are either restricted in\nscope, expensive in computation, or inaccurate in predicting important\nstatistics. In this work, we develop a novel, second-order moment closure\napproximation method for binary-state rewire-to-random and rewire-to-same model\nvariants. We incorporate a small amount of noise via a random mutation term,\nwhich renders the system ergodic. Using ergodicity, we then approximate the\nvoting process, which is non-Markovian in the second moments of the system,\nwith a Markovian term near the phase transition. This approximation exploits an\nasymmetry between different classes of voting events. The resulting scheme\nenables us to predict the location of the phase transition and the active edge\ndensity in the regime of persistent disagreement, across the entire space of\nparameters and opinion densities. Numerically, our results are nearly exact for\nthe rewire-to-random model, and competitive with other current approaches for\nthe rewire-to-same model.

To uncover the dynamical mechanisms, the evolving spatiotemporal\npatterns and critical phenomena of networked coevolution spreading are\nextremely important, which provide theoretical foundations for us to control\nepidemic spreading, predict collective behaviors in social systems, and so on.\nThe coevolution spreading dynamics in complex networks has thus attracted much\nattention in many disciplines.

We first present an\nobservational study of mobile phone usage according to gender and age groups.\nWe are able to detect significant differences in phone usage among different\nsubgroups of the population.

We show how a specific implementation of\na diffusion model, harnessing the graph structure, has significantly better\nperformance over other node-based standard ML methods.

In\nthis paper, we gauge the effects of echo chambers in information spreading\nphenomena over political communication networks. Mining 12 million Twitter\nmessages, we reconstruct a network in which users interchange opinions related\nto the impeachment of the former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. We define\na continuous {political position} parameter, independent of the network's\nstructure, that allows to quantify the presence of echo chambers in the\nstrongly connected component of the network, reflected in two well-separated\ncommunities of similar sizes with opposite views of the impeachment process. By\nmeans of simple spreading models, we show that the capability of users in\npropagating the content they produce, measured by the associated spreadability,\nstrongly depends on their attitude. Users expressing pro-impeachment sentiments\nare capable to transmit information, on average, to a larger audience than\nusers expressing anti-impeachment sentiments. Furthermore, the users'\nspreadability is correlated to the diversity, in terms of political position,\nof the audience reached. Our method can be exploited to identify the presence\nof echo chambers and their effects across different contexts and shed light\nupon the mechanisms allowing to break echo chambers. \n\n"}

Here we\nintroduce a spectral approach for detecting a network's low-dimensional\nstructure, and the nodes that participate in it, using any null model. We use\ngenerative models to estimate the expected eigenvalue distribution under a\nspecified null model, and then detect where the data network's eigenspectra\nexceed the estimated bounds. On synthetic networks, this spectral estimation\napproach cleanly detects transitions between random and community structure,\nrecovers the number and membership of communities, and removes noise nodes. On\nreal networks spectral estimation finds either a significant fraction of noise\nnodes or no departure from a null model, in stark contrast to traditional\ncommunity detection methods. Across all analyses, we find the choice of null\nmodel can strongly alter conclusions about the presence of network structure.\nOur spectral estimation approach is therefore a promising basis for detecting\nlow-dimensional structure in real-world networks, or lack thereof. \n\n"}

In this work we analyze approximately\n$10^6$ tweets exchanged during the last Italian elections. By using an\nentropy-based null model discounting the activity of the users, we first\nidentify potential political alliances within the group of verified accounts:\nif two verified users are retweeted more than expected by the non-verified\nones, they are likely to be related. Then, we derive the users' affiliation to\na coalition measuring the polarization of unverified accounts. Finally, we\nstudy the bipartite directed representation of the tweets and retweets network,\nin which tweets and users are collected on the two layers. Users with the\nhighest out-degree identify the most popular ones, whereas highest out-degree\nposts are the most \"viral\".

Many\napproaches have been proposed, however, most previous model frameworks are\nfairly restrictive. We introduce a new social modeling approach that enables\nthe creation of models directly from data with minimal a priori restrictions on\nthe model class. In particular, we infer the minimally complex, maximally\npredictive representation of an individual's behavior when viewed in isolation\nand as driven by a social input. We then apply this framework to a\nheterogeneous catalog of human behavior collected from fifteen thousand users\non the microblogging platform Twitter. The models allow us to describe how a\nuser processes their past behavior and their social inputs. Despite the\ndiversity of observed user behavior, most models inferred fall into a small\nsubclass of all possible finite-state processes. Thus, our work demonstrates\nthat user behavior, while quite complex, belies simple underlying computational\nstructures. \n\n"}

Governments around the world are adopting technology\nfor faster resolution of civic issues. Typically, citizens report issues, such\nas broken roads, garbage dumps, etc. through web portals and mobile apps, in\norder for the government authorities to take appropriate actions. Several\nmediums -- text, image, audio, video -- are used to report these issues.\nThrough a user study with 13 citizens and 3 authorities, we found that image is\nthe most preferred medium to report civic issues. However, analyzing civic\nissue related images is challenging for the authorities as it requires manual\neffort. Moreover, previous works have been limited to identifying a specific\nset of issues from images. In this work, given an image, we propose to generate\na Civic Issue Graph consisting of a set of objects and the semantic relations\nbetween them, which are representative of the underlying civic issue. We also\nrelease two multi-modal (text and images) datasets, that can help in further\nanalysis of civic issues from images.

Our approach offers two benefits compared to the state of the\nart. First, we offer a blueprint for modeling of user attention. Rather than\nassuming a logarithmic loss in importance as a function of the rank, we can\naccount for varying user behaviors through parametrization. For example, we\nexpect a user to see more items during a viewing of a social media feed than\nwhen they inspect the results list of a single web search query. Second, we\nallow non-binary protected attributes to enable investigating inherently\ncontinuous attributes (\\eg political alignment on the liberal to conservative\nspectrum) as well as to facilitate measurements across aggregated sets of\nsearch results, rather than separately for each result list. By combining these\ntwo elements into our metric, we are able to better address the human factors\ninherent in this problem. We measure the whole sociotechnical system,\nconsisting of a ranking algorithm and individuals using it, instead of\nexclusively focusing on the ranking algorithm. Finally, we use our metric to\nperform three simulated fairness audits. We show that determining fairness of a\nranked output necessitates knowledge (or a model) of the end-users of the\nparticular service. Depending on their attention distribution function, a fixed\nranking of results can appear biased both in favor and against a protected\ngroup. \n\n"}

In this paper, we exploit this fact to reduce\nthe disparate impact of a fixed classification model over a population of\ninterest. Given a black-box classifier, we aim to eliminate the performance gap\nby perturbing the distribution of input variables for the disadvantaged group.\nWe refer to the perturbed distribution as a counterfactual distribution, and\ncharacterize its properties for common fairness criteria. We introduce a\ndescent algorithm to learn a counterfactual distribution from data.

Risk adjustment formulas predict spending in\nhealth insurance markets in order to provide fair benefits and health care\ncoverage for all enrollees, regardless of their health status. Unfortunately,\ncurrent risk adjustment formulas are known to underpredict spending for\nspecific groups of enrollees leading to undercompensated payments to health\ninsurers. This incentivizes insurers to design their plans such that\nindividuals in undercompensated groups will be less likely to enroll, impacting\naccess to health care for these groups. To improve risk adjustment formulas for\nundercompensated groups, we expand on concepts from the statistics, computer\nscience, and health economics literature to develop new fair regression methods\nfor continuous outcomes by building fairness considerations directly into the\nobjective function. We additionally propose a novel measure of fairness while\nasserting that a suite of metrics is necessary in order to evaluate risk\nadjustment formulas more fully. Our data application using the IBM MarketScan\nResearch Databases and simulation studies demonstrate that these new fair\nregression methods may lead to massive improvements in group fairness (e.g.,\n98%) with only small reductions in overall fit (e.g., 4%). \n\n"}
