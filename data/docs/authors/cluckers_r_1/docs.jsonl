With logical operators standing for operations on games, the\nformalism of CoL is open-ended, and has already undergone series of extensions.\nThis article extends the expressive power of CoL in a qualitatively new way,\ngeneralizing formulas (to which the earlier languages of CoL were limited) to\ncircuit-style structures termed cirquents. The latter, unlike formulas, are\nable to account for subgame/subtask sharing between different parts of the\noverall game/task. Among the many advantages offered by this ability is that it\nallows us to capture, refine and generalize the well known\nindependence-friendly logic which, after the present leap forward, naturally\nbecomes a conservative fragment of CoL, just as classical logic had been known\nto be a conservative fragment of the formula-based version of CoL. Technically,\nthis paper is self-contained, and can be read without any prior familiarity\nwith CoL. \n\n"}

These extensions include extension to accelerated observers,\nrelativistic dynamics and general relativity; however, its main subject is the\nextension to accelerated observers (AccRel).

Even if we add\nthe whole first-order theory of real numbers to this natural extension, it is\nstill not enough to imply the twin paradox.

We consider the question of\nexistence of (unconditionally) f-productive sequences for a given \"weight\nfunction\" f. We prove that: (1) a Hausdorff group having an f-productive\nsequence for some f contains a homeomorphic copy of the Cantor set; (2) if a\nnon-discrete group is either locally compact Hausdorff or Weil complete metric,\nthen it contains an unconditionally f-productive sequence for every function f:\nN--> N; (3) a metric group is NSS if and only if it does not contain an\nf_omega-Cauchy productive sequence, where f_omega is the function taking the\nconstant value omega. We give an example of an f_omega-productive sequence\n{a_n: n in N} in a (necessarily non-abelian) separable metric group H with a\nlinear topology and a bijection s: N --> N such that the sequence {prod_{n=0}^m\na_{s(n)}: m in N} diverges, thereby answering a question of Dominguez and\nTarieladze. Furthermore, we show that H has no unconditionally\nf_omega-productive sequences. As an application of our results, we resolve\nnegatively a question from C_p(-,G)-theory. \n\n"}

This may be compared to monstrous moonshine, in\nwhich modular functions are attached to elements of the Monster group. One of\nthe most remarkable aspects of monstrous moonshine is the following genus zero\nproperty: the modular functions turn out to be the generators for the function\nfields of their invariance groups. In particular, these invariance groups\ndefine genus zero quotients of the upper half plane. It is therefore natural to\nask if there is an analogue of this property in the Mathieu case, and at first\nglance the answer appears to be negative since not all the discrete groups\narising there have genus zero. On the other hand, in this article we prove that\neach (mock) modular form appearing in the Mathieu correspondence coincides with\nthe Rademacher sum constructed from its polar part. This property, inspired by\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence in physics, was shown previously to be equivalent to\nthe genus zero property of monstrous moonshine. Hence we conclude that this\n\"Rademacher summability\" property serves as the natural analogue of the genus\nzero property in the Mathieu case. Our result constitutes further evidence that\nthe Rademacher method provides a powerful framework for understanding the\nmodularity of moonshine, and leads to interesting physical questions regarding\nthe gravitational duals of the relevant conformal field theories. \n\n"}

The most natural way to do this - and the simplest, once the\n(substantial) groundwork has been laid - is to consider promonoidal categories\nas an instance of the general theory of pseudomonoids in a monoidal bicategory.\nAccordingly, we describe and explain the notions of monoidal bicategory and\npseudomonoid therein.\n  The higher-dimensional nature of monoidal bicategories presents serious\nnotational difficulties, since to use the natural analogue of the commutative\ndiagrams used in ordinary category theory would require the use of\nthree-dimensional diagrams.

This search\ngoes beyond the usual model theory, based on Tarski's notion of semantic\nconsequence, and beyond the usual formalism of first-order logic, based on\nschemata.

The excised model is motivated by a formula\nfor central values of these $L$-functions in a paper by Kohnen and Zagier. This\nformula indicates that for a finite set of $L$-functions from a family of\nquadratic twists, the central values are all either zero or are greater than\nsome positive cutoff. The excised model imposes this same condition on the\ncentral values of characteristic polynomials of matrices from $SO(2N)$.\nStrangely, the cutoff on the characteristic polynomials that results in a\nconvincing model for the $L$-function zeros is significantly smaller than that\nwhich we would obtain by naively transferring Kohnen and Zagier's cutoff to the\n$SO(2N)$ ensemble. In this current paper we investigate a modification to the\nexcised model. It lacks the simplicity of the original excised ensemble, but it\nserves to explain the reason for the unexpectedly low cutoff in the original\nexcised model. Additionally, the distribution of central $L$-values is\n`choppier' than the distribution of characteristic polynomials, in the sense\nthat it is a superposition of a series of peaks: the characteristic polynomial\ndistribution is a smooth approximation to this. The excised model didn't\nattempt to incorporate these successive peaks, only the initial cutoff.

Let $f$ be a Hilbert modular form over $F$ of\nparallel weight $2$, which is a new form and is ordinary at $p$. Let $E$ be a\ntotally imaginary quadratic extension of $F$ of discriminant prime to $p$ and\nto the conductor of $f$. We may construct a $p$-adic $L$ function that\ninterpolates special values of the complex $L$ functions associated to $f$, $E$\nand finite order Hecke characters of $E$. The $p$-adic Gross-Zagier formula\nrelates the central derivative of this $p$-adic $L$ function to the $p$-adic\nheight of a Heegner divisor on a certain Shimura curve.\n  The strategy of the proof is close to that of the original work of\nPerrin-Riou.

If this algorithm could be physically\nimplemented, as much as it is valid in principle--that is, if certain\nhamiltonian and its ground state can be physically constructed according to the\nproposal--quantum computability would surpass classical computability as\ndelimited by the Church-Turing thesis.

{"id": "quant-ph/0608035", "contents": "Title: Quantum measurements without sums Abstract: Sums play a prominent role in the formalisms of quantum mechanics, be it for\nmixing and superposing states, or for composing state spaces. Surprisingly, a\nconceptual analysis of quantum measurement seems to suggest that quantum\nmechanics can be done without direct sums, expressed entirely in terms of the\ntensor product. The corresponding axioms define classical spaces as objects\nthat allow copying and deleting data. Indeed, the information exchange between\nthe quantum and the classical worlds is essentially determined by their\ndistinct capabilities to copy and delete data. The sums turn out to be an\nimplicit implementation of this capabilities. Realizing it through explicit\naxioms not only dispenses with the unnecessary structural baggage, but also\nallows a simple and intuitive graphical calculus. In category-theoretic terms,\nclassical data types are dagger-compact Frobenius algebras, and quantum spectra\nunderlying quantum measurements are Eilenberg-Moore coalgebras induced by these\nFrobenius algebras. \n\n"}
