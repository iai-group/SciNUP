Finite-size\nprecursors of such behavior are verified by robust variations of nuclear\nproperties (nuclear masses, excitation energies, transition probabilities for\nlow lying levels) across the chart of nuclides. Simultaneously, the model\nserves as a theoretical laboratory for studying diverse general features of\nQPTs in interacting many-body systems, which differ in many respects from\nlattice models of solid-state physics. We outline the most important fields of\nthe present interest: (a) The coexistence of first- and second-order phase\ntransitions supports studies related to the microscopic origin of the QPT\nphenomena.

BOMCA is derived using a modification\nof the saddle point technique, in which the path integral is approximated by\nexpanding around a near-classical path, chosen so that up to some predetermined\norder there is no need to add any correction terms to the leading order\napproximation. Both Complex WKB and BOMCA give the same leading order\napproximation; in Complex WKB higher accuracy is achieved by adding correction\nterms, while in BOMCA no additional terms are ever added -higher accuracy is\nachieved by changing the path along which the original approximation is\ncomputed.

In a recent paper, M\\\"uller, Peters and Chu [Nature {\\bf 463},\n926-929 (2010)] argued that atom interferometers also provide a very accurate\ntest of the gravitational redshift when considering the atom as a clock\noperating at the Compton frequency associated with the rest mass. We analyze\nthis claim in the frame of general relativity and of different alternative\ntheories. We show that the difference of \"Compton phases\" between the two paths\nof the interferometer is actually zero in a large class of theories, including\ngeneral relativity, all metric theories of gravity, most non-metric theories\nand most theoretical frameworks used to interpret the violations of the\nequivalence principle.

The review discusses similar physics that emerges in\nopen and marginally stable quantum many-body systems. In the presence of open\ndecay channels, the intrinsic states are coupled through the continuum. At\nsufficiently strong continuum coupling, the spectrum of resonances undergoes\nthe restructuring with segregation of very broad super-radiant states and\ntrapping of remaining long-lived compound states. The appropriate formalism\ndescribing this phenomenon is based on the Feshbach projection method and\neffective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. A broader generalization is related to the\nidea of doorway states connecting quantum states of different structure.

Such task is\naccomplished by quantum authentication protocols which are distributed\nalgorithms based on the intrinsic properties of Quantum Mechanics. The choice\nof an authentication protocol must consider that quantum states are very\ndelicate and that the channel is subject to eavesdropping. However, even in\nface of the various existing definitions of quantum authentication protocols in\nthe literature, little is known about them in this perspective, and this lack\nof knowledge may unfavor comparisons and wise choices. In the attempt to\novercome this limitation, in the present work we aim at showing an approach to\nevaluate quantum authentication protocols based on the determination of their\nquantum communication complexity. Based on our investigation, no similar\nmethods to analyze quantum authentication protocols were found in the\nliterature.

In this paper, a new physical\nmechanism for dealing with the first of these problems is proposed: interplay\nbetween different degrees of freedom in a hyperentangled system (parametric\ndown conversion) is used to increase the Hilbert space dimension available for\nkey generation while maintaining security. Polarization-based Bell tests\nprovide security checking, while orbital angular momentum (OAM) and total\nangular momentum (TAM) provide higher key generation rate.

Most\nmetrology schemes measure a single parameter of a dynamical process by probing\nit with a specially designed quantum state. The success of such a scheme\nusually relies on the process belonging to a particular one-parameter family.\nIf this assumption is violated, or if the goal is to measure more than one\nparameter, a different quantum state may perform better. In the most extreme\ncase, we know nothing about the process and wish to learn everything. This\nrequires quantum process tomography, which demands an informationally-complete\nset of probe states. It is very convenient if this set is group-covariant --\ni.e., each element is generated by applying an element of the quantum system's\nnatural symmetry group to a single fixed fiducial state.

There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently\nwell understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired\nquantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in\nquantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to\ndescribe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems\ngenerally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a\nmicroscopic level.

Although this mechanism ensures that no light escapes from the\nwaveguide, it gives rise to an evanescent field in the cladding. While this\nfield is protected from interacting with the environment in standard optical\nfibers, it is routinely employed in air- or vacuum-clad fibers in order to\nefficiently couple light fields to optical components or emitters using, e.g.,\ntapered optical fiber couplers. Remarkably, the strong confinement imposed by\nthe latter can lead to significant coupling of the light's spin and orbital\nangular momentum.

A previous paper (Floess et al. in\nMath. Struct. in Comp. Science 23: 386, 2013) has proved that if a $n$-variable\nBoolean function $f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ does not depend on an input variable\n$x_i$, using the Bernstein-Vazirani circuit to $f$ will always obtain an output\n$y$ that has a $0$ in the $i$th position. We generalize this result and show\nthat after one time running the algorithm, the probability of getting a 1 in\neach position $i$ is equal to the dependence degree of $f$ on the variable\n$x_i$, i.e. the influence of $x_i$ on $f$. On this foundation, we give an\napproximation algorithm to evaluate the influence of any variable on a Boolean\nfunction. Next, as an application, we use it to study the Boolean functions\nwith juntas, and construct probabilistic quantum algorithms to learn certain\nBoolean functions.

In this work we show how to\nconstruct collective quantum heat machines and explore their performance boosts\nwith respect to regular machines. Without interactions between the machines the\nindividual units operate in a stochastic, non-quantum manner. The construction\nof the collective machine becomes possible by introducing two simple quantum\noperations: coherence extraction and coherence injection. Together these\noperations can harvest coherence from one engine and use it to boost the\nperformance of a slightly different engine. For weakly driven engines we show\nthat the collective work output scales quadratically with the number of engines\nrather than linearly.

The\nclassification is parameterized by three indices, taking values in a group,\nwhich is either trivial, the group of integers, or the group of integers modulo\n2, depending on the type of symmetry.

Of the three indices, two are related to the asymptotic behaviour far to\nthe right and far to the left, respectively. These are also stable under\ncompact perturbations. The third index is sensitive to those compact\nperturbations which cannot be contracted to a trivial one. The results apply to\nthe Hamiltonian case as well.

Here we write down the field equations which\nfollow from this action. We argue that the large mass limit yields Einstein\nequations, provided we assume wave function collapse and localisation for large\nmasses. The small mass limit yields the Dirac equation. We explain why the\nKerr-Newman black hole has the same gyromagnetic ratio as the Dirac electron,\nboth being twice the classical value. The small mass limit also provides\ncompelling reasons for introducing torsion, which is sourced by the spin\ndensity of the Dirac field. There is thus a symmetry between torsion and\ngravity: torsion couples to quantum objects through Planck's constant $\\hbar$\n(but not $G$) and is important in the microscopic limit. Whereas gravity\ncouples to classical matter, as usual, through Newton's gravitational constant\n$G$ (but not $\\hbar$), and is important in the macroscopic limit.

Of particular\ninterest are quantum heuristics, which require experimentation on quantum\nhardware for their evaluation, and which have the potential to significantly\nexpand the breadth of quantum computing applications. A leading candidate is\nFarhi et al.'s Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, which alternates\nbetween applying a cost-function-based Hamiltonian and a mixing Hamiltonian.\nHere, we extend this framework to allow alternation between more general\nfamilies of operators. The essence of this extension, the Quantum Alternating\nOperator Ansatz, is the consideration of general parametrized families of\nunitaries rather than only those corresponding to the time-evolution under a\nfixed local Hamiltonian for a time specified by the parameter. This ansatz\nsupports the representation of a larger, and potentially more useful, set of\nstates than the original formulation, with potential long-term impact on a\nbroad array of application areas. For cases that call for mixing only within a\ndesired subspace, refocusing on unitaries rather than Hamiltonians enables more\nefficiently implementable mixers than was possible in the original framework.\nSuch mixers are particularly useful for optimization problems with hard\nconstraints that must always be satisfied, defining a feasible subspace, and\nsoft constraints whose violation we wish to minimize. More efficient\nimplementation enables earlier experimental exploration of an alternating\noperator approach to a wide variety of approximate optimization, exact\noptimization, and sampling problems. Here, we introduce the Quantum Alternating\nOperator Ansatz, lay out design criteria for mixing operators, detail mappings\nfor eight problems, and provide brief descriptions of mappings for diverse\nproblems. \n\n"}

In\nthe first half of the thesis, we investigated the quantum pump using the full\ncounting statistics with quantum master equation (FCS-QME) approach.

The\naverage entropy production is composed of the time integral of the\ninstantaneous steady entropy production rate and the excess entropy production.\nWe define average entropy production rate using the average energy and particle\ncurrents, which are calculated by using the full counting statistics with QME.\nThe excess entropy production is given by a line integral in the control\nparameter space and its integrand is called the Berry-Sinitsyn-Nemenman (BSN)\nvector. In the weakly nonequilibrium regime, we show that BSN vector is\ndescribed by $\\ln \\rho_0^{(-1)}$ and $\\rho_0$ where $\\rho_0$ is the\ninstantaneous steady state of the QME and $\\rho_0^{(-1)}$ is that of the QME\nwhich is given by reversing the sign of the Lamb shift term.

Transitioning from the\ndomain of photons to atoms opens new perspectives on fundamental concepts, such\nas the classification of entanglement of identical particles. It aids in the\ndesign of novel probes of quantities such as entanglement entropy by combining\nwell established tools of AMO physics - unity single-atom detection, tunable\ninteractions, and scalability - with the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference.\nFurthermore, it is now possible for established protocols in the photon\ncommunity, such as measurement-induced entanglement, to be employed in atomic\nexperiments that possess deterministic single-particle production and\ndetection. Hence, the realization of the HOM effect with atoms represents a\nproductive union of central ideas in quantum control of atoms and photons. \n\n"}

This realisation has led to interest in\nhybrid quantum-classical algorithms allowing, for example, quantum computers to\nsolve large problems despite having very limited numbers of qubits.

By studying\nhow the relational probability amplitude matrix is transformed and how mutual\ninformation is exchanged during measurement, we derive the formulation that is\nmathematically equivalent to the traditional quantum measurement theory. More\nimportantly, the formulation results in significant conceptual consequences. We\nshow that for a given quantum system, it is possible to describe its time\nevolution without explicitly calling out a reference system. However,\ndescription of a quantum measurement must be explicitly relative. Traditional\nquantum mechanics assumes a super observer who can instantaneously know the\nmeasurement results from any location. For a composite system consists\nspace-like separated subsystems, the assumption of super observer must be\nabandoned and the relational formulation of quantum measurement becomes\nnecessary. This is confirmed in the resolution of EPR paradox. Information\nexchange is relative to a local observer in quantum mechanics.

II: A Concrete\n  Implementation Abstract: The present paper is the companion of [1] in which we proposed a scheme that\ntries to derive the Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on Curved Spacetimes (CST) limit\nfrom background independent Quantum General Relativity (QGR). The constructions\nof [1] make heavy use of the notion of semiclassical states for QGR. In the\npresent paper, we employ the complexifier coherent states for QGR recently\nproposed by Thiemann and Winkler as semiclassical states, and thus fill the\ngeneral formulas obtained in [1] with life. We demonstrate how one can, under\nsome simplifying assumptions, explicitely compute expectation values of the\noperators relevant for the gravity-matter Hamiltonians of [1] in the\ncomplexifier coherent states. These expectation values give rise to effective\nmatter Hamiltonians on the background on which the gravitational coherent state\nis peaked and thus induce approximate notions of n-particle states and matter\npropagation on fluctuating spacetimes. We display the details for the scalar\nand the electromagnetic field. The effective theories exhibit two types of\ncorrections as compared to the the ordinary QFT on CST. The first is due to the\nquantum fluctuations of the gravitational field, the second arises from the\nfact that background independence forces both geometry and matter to propagate\non a spacetime that is the product of the real line and a (random) graph.\nFinally we obtain explicit numerical predictions for non-standard dispersion\nrelations for the scalar and the electromagnetic field.

For the zero temperature bath these pointer states\nturn out to be coherent states of the harmonic oscillator for arbitrary initial\nstates of the apparatus. For a high temperature bath pointer states are\nGaussian distributions (generalized coherent states). For both cases, the\noff-diagonal elements in spin-space decohere over a time scale which goes\ninversely as the square of the \"separation\" between the \"pointers\". Our exact\nresults also demonstrate in an unambiguous way that the pointer states in this\nmeasurement model emerge independent of the initial state of the apparatus. \n\n"}

Of all\nquantum functions, we focus on resource-bounded quantum functions whose inputs\nare classical bit strings. We prove complexity-theoretical properties and\nunique characteristics of these quantum functions by recent techniques\ndeveloped for the analysis of quantum computations. We also discuss relativized\nquantum functions that make adaptive and nonadaptive oracle queries. \n\n"}

In this sense, it can be called the quantum central processing\nunit (QCPU). For a given quantum computing, its realization of QCPU is just its\nquantum network. QCPU is standard and easy-assemble because it only has two\nkinds of basic elements and two auxiliary elements. QCPU and its realizations\nare scalable, that is, they can be connected together, and so they can\nconstruct the whole quantum network to implement the general quantum algorithm\nand quantum simulating procedure. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/9911054", "contents": "Title: Security Aspects of Practical Quantum Cryptography Abstract: The use of quantum bits (qubits) in cryptography holds the promise of secure\ncryptographic quantum key distribution schemes. Unfortunately, the implemented\nschemes can be totally insecure. We provide a thorough investigation of\nsecurity issues for practical quantum key distribution, taking into account\nchannel losses, a realistic detection process, and modifications of the\n``qubits'' sent from the sender to the receiver. We first show that even\nquantum key distribution with perfect qubits cannot be achieved over long\ndistances when fixed channel losses and fixed dark count errors are taken into\naccount. Then we show that existing experimental schemes (based on\n``weak-pulse'') are usually totally insecure. Finally we show that parametric\ndownconversion offers enhanced performance compared to its weak coherent pulse\ncounterpart. \n\n"}
