Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail.

ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

The measured 1-0 S(0)/1-0 S(1) and\n2-1 S(1)/1-0 S(1) line ratios in LkHa 264 indicate that the H2 emitting gas is\nat T<1500 K and that the H2 is most likely thermally excited by UV photons.\nModeling of the shape of the line suggests that the disk should be seen close\nto face-on (i<35).

The three stages involves a neutron star phase, a quark star (QS)\nand a black hole phase as described in Staff et al. (2007). We find that the QS\nstage allows for more energy to be extracted from neutron star to QS conversion\nas well as from ensuing accretion onto the QS. The QS accretion phase naturally\nextends the engine activity and can account for both the prompt emission and\nirregular early X-ray afterglow activity. Following the accretion phase, the QS\ncan spin-down by emission of a baryon-free outflow.

The northwestern\nend of the nebula (B59 region) is found to have a low degree of polarization\nand high dispersion in polarization position angle, while at the other extreme\nof the cloud (the `bowl') we found mean degrees of polarization as high as\n$\\approx$15% and a low dispersion in polarization position angle.

We propose that three distinct\nregions exist, which may be related to different evolutionary states of the\ncloud; this idea is supported by both the polarization properties across the\nPipe and the estimated mass-to-flux ratio that varies between approximately\nsuper-critical toward the B59 region and sub-critical inside the bowl. The\nthree regions that we identify are: the B59 region, which is currently forming\nstars; the stem, which appears to be at an earlier stage of star formation\nwhere material has been through a collapsing phase but not yet given birth to\nstars; and the bowl, which represents the earliest stage of the cloud in which\nthe collapsing phase and cloud fragmentation has already started. \n\n"}

For 3-dimensional clustering statistics, we find\nthat none of the internal error methods investigated are able to reproduce\nneither accurately nor robustly the errors of external estimators on 1 to 25\nMpc/h scales. The standard bootstrap overestimates the variance of xi(s) by\n~40% on all scales probed, but recovers, in a robust fashion, the principal\neigenvectors of the underlying covariance matrix. The jackknife returns the\ncorrect variance on large scales, but significantly overestimates it on smaller\nscales. This scale dependence in the jackknife affects the recovered\neigenvectors, which tend to disagree on small scales with the external\nestimates.

The mean depth of the first interaction point and its\nfluctuations are a measure of the proton-air particle production cross section.\nSince the first interaction point in air cannot be measured directly, various\nmethods have been developed in the past to estimate the depth of the first\ninteraction from air shower observables in combination with simulations. As the\nsimulations depend on assumptions made for hadronic particle production at\nenergies and phase space regions not accessible in accelerator experiments, the\nderived cross sections are subject to significant systematic uncertainties. The\nfocus of this work is the development of an improved analysis technique that\nallows a significant reduction of the model dependence of the derived cross\nsection at very high energy.

Without introducing a\ncomplex form of couplings, inflaton field may either roll-in (like a standard\nhybrid inflation) or roll-out (like an inverted-hybrid model or quintessential\ninflation) on arbitrary inflaton potential. Significant signatures of remote\ninflation can be observed in the spectrum caused by (1) the inhomogeneous phase\ntransition in the remote sector, or (2) a successive phase transition in the\nremote sector.

We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any\ntidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster\nlives long enough for the overdensities to build up.\n  The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster\ncentre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the\nstrength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,\nwhile for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing\na periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance\noscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of\nthe overdensities in this case.\n  We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal\ntails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field\non the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous. Moreover, we conclude that a\npericentre passage or a disk shock is not the direct origin of an overdensity\nwithin a tidal tail. Escape due to such tidal perturbations does not take place\nimmediately after the perturbation but is rather delayed and spread over the\norbit of the cluster.

We utilize the deep\noptical and infrared data (ACS/NICMOS) over the CDF-S and HDF-N GOODS fields,\nas well as the UDF for our primary UBVi \"dropout\" sample.

Lower luminosity galaxies are also found\nto be bluer than higher luminosity galaxies at z~2.5 and z~4. We do not find a\nlarge number of galaxies with beta's as red as -1 in our dropout selections at\nz~4, and particularly at z>~5, even though such sources could be readily\nselected from our data. This suggests that star-forming galaxies at z>~5 almost\nuniversally have very blue UV-continuum slopes, and that there are not likely\nto be a substantial number of dust-obscured galaxies at z>~5 that are missed in\n\"dropout\" searches. Using the same relation between UV-continuum slope and dust\nextinction as found to be appropriate at z~0 and z~2, we estimate the average\ndust extinction of galaxies as a function of redshift and UV luminosity in a\nconsistent way. We find that the estimated dust extinction increases\nsubstantially with cosmic time for the most UV luminous galaxies, but remains\nsmall (<~2x) at all times for lower luminosity galaxies. Because these same\nlower luminosity galaxies dominate the luminosity density in the UV, the\noverall dust extinction correction remains modest at all redshifts.

In the\npenumbra, up-flows dominate only at low velocities |v_dop| < 0.4 km/s while at\nlarger velocities |v_dop| > 0.6 km/s down-flows prevail. Additionally, the\nmaximal up-flow velocity in penumbrae is smaller, while the maximal down-flow\nvelocity is larger with respect to the QS velocities. Furthermore, on a spatial\naverage, the penumbra shows a red-shift, corresponding to a down-flow of more\nthan 0.1 km/s. Up-flows are elongated and appear predominately in the inner\npenumbra.

In this paper, new optical\nimaging and spectroscopic data for the lensing galaxies of B2108+213 and the\nsurrounding field galaxies are presented.

However, the tentative detection of\nthe G-band and Mg-b absorption lines, and a break in the spectrum of the host\ngalaxy of the lensed quasar gives a likely source redshift of z = 0.67.\nSpectroscopy of the field around B2108+213 finds 51 galaxies at a similar\nredshift to G1, thus confirming that there is a much larger structure at z ~\n0.365 associated with this system.

During the evolution of the host galaxy, hot and cold gas are\nadded to the SMBH by flows triggered by halo gas cooling, disc instabilities\nand galaxy mergers. This builds up the mass and spin of the BH, and the\nresulting accretion power regulates the gas cooling and subsequent star\nformation. The accretion flow is assumed to form a geometrically thin cool disc\nwhen the accretion rate exceeds 0.01\\dot{M}_Edd, and a geometrically thick,\nradiatively inefficient hot flow when the accretion rate falls below this\nvalue. The resulting quasar optical luminosity function matches observations\nvery well, and the mass of the SMBH correlates with the mass of the galaxy\nbulge as observed. The BH spin distribution depends strongly on whether the gas\nin any given accretion episode remains in the same plane (prolonged accretion)\nor whether, due to self-gravity, it fragments into multiple, randomly aligned\naccretion episodes (chaotic accretion).

The interaction of\nvery-high-energy (VHE: E>100 GeV) gamma-rays, emitted by sources located at\ncosmological distances, with the intervening EBL results in electron-positron\npair production that leads to energy-dependent attenuation of the observed VHE\nflux. This introduces a fundamental ambiguity in the interpretation of the\nmeasured VHE blazar spectra: neither the intrinsic spectra, nor the EBL, are\nseparately known - only their combination is. In this paper we propose a method\nto measure the EBL photon number density. It relies on using simultaneous\nobservations of blazars in the optical, X-ray, high-energy (HE: E>100 MeV)\ngamma-ray (from the Fermi telescope), and VHE gamma-ray (from Cherenkov\ntelescopes) bands. For each source, the method involves best-fitting the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) from optical through HE gamma-rays (the\nlatter being largely unaffected by EBL attenuation as long as z<1) with a\nSynchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) model.

We exclude the\npossibility that this cool clump was formed by local inhomogeneous radiative\ncooling in the intra-cluster medium, due to the effectiveness of the thermal\nconduction on the time-scale of $\\sim 0.3$ Gyr. Since no evidence for central\nAGN activity has been found in Abell 3158, and this cool clump bears many\nsimilarities to the off-centre cool gas clumps detected in other merging\nclusters in terms of their mass, size, location, and thermal properties (e.g.\nlower temperature and higher abundance as compared with the environment), we\nspeculate that the cool clump in Abell 3158 was caused by a merger event, and\nis the remnant of the original central cool-core of the main cluster or the\ninfalling sub-cluster.

However, inferences about galaxy\npopulation properties are in practice limited by 'cosmic variance'. This is the\nuncertainty in observational estimates of the number density of galaxies\narising from the underlying large-scale density fluctuations. This source of\nuncertainty can be significant, especially for surveys which cover only small\nareas and for massive high-redshift galaxies. Cosmic variance for a given\ngalaxy population can be determined using predictions from cold dark matter\ntheory and the galaxy bias. In this paper we provide tools for experiment\ndesign and interpretation. For a given survey geometry we present the cosmic\nvariance of dark matter as a function of mean redshift z and redshift bin size\nDz. Using a halo occupation model to predict galaxy clustering, we derive the\ngalaxy bias as a function of mean redshift for galaxy samples of a given\nstellar mass range. In the linear regime, the cosmic variance of these galaxy\nsamples is the product of the galaxy bias and the dark matter cosmic variance.\nWe present a simple recipe using a fitting function to compute cosmic variance\nas a function of the angular dimensions of the field, z, Dz and stellar mass\nm*.

The Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability strips gas from these clouds. If the pressure and the the\nmetallicity of the corona are high enough, the stripped gas causes a similar\nmass of coronal gas to condense in the cloud's wake. Hydrodynamical simulations\nof cloud-corona interaction are presented. These confirm the existence of a\ncritical ablation rate above which the corona is condensed, and imply that for\nthe likely parameters of the Galactic corona this rate lies near the actual\nablation rate of clouds.

The radiative transfer\nformulation took full account of emission, absorption, re-emission, Faraday\nrotation and Faraday conversion explicitly. High time-resolution intensity maps\nwere generated, frame-by-frame, to track the spatial hydrodynamical and\nradiative properties of the evolving jets.

In particular, the transport\ndecreases with decreasing $Pm$; if persistent at very large Reynolds numbers,\nthis trend may lead to question the role of MRI-turbulence in YSO disks, whose\nPrandtl number is usually very small.

Another objective is to characterize the effect of linear (channel\nmodes) and quasi-linear (parasitic modes) physics in the behavior of the\ntransport. These objectives are addressed with the help of a number of\nincompressible numerical simulations. The horizontal extent of the box size has\nbeen increased in order to capture all relevant (fastest growing) linear and\nsecondary parasitic unstable modes.

Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid.

The pure supergravity part of the total action has a local\nPoincare supersymmetry, whereas the chiral and vector multiplets coupled to\nsupergravity have a larger local superconformal symmetry. The scale-free\nglobally supersymmetric theories, such as the NMSSM with a scale-invariant\nsuperpotential, can be naturally embedded into this class of theories. After\nthe supergravity embedding, the Jordan frame scalar potential of such theories\nremains scale free; it is quartic, it contains no mass terms, no\nnonrenormalizable terms, no cosmological constant.

In this paper we compare two methods for making this determination in\ncosmological simulations where the internal structures of molecular clouds are\nunresolved: a complex time-dependent chemistry network coupled to a radiative\ntransfer calculation of the dissociating ultraviolet (UV) radiation field, and\na simple time-independent analytic approximation. We show that these two\nmethods produce excellent agreement at all metallicities >~10^-2 of the Milky\nWay value across a very wide range of UV fields. At lower metallicities the\nagreement is worse, likely because time-dependent effects become important;\nhowever, there are no observational calibrations of molecular gas content at\nsuch low metallicities, so it is unclear if either method is accurate. The\ncomparison suggests that, in many but not all applications, the analytic\napproximation provides a viable and nearly cost-free alternative to full\ntime-dependent chemistry and radiative transfer. \n\n"}

In particular, recent\nimaging surveys of 143 early-type galaxies belonging to the Virgo and Fornax\nClusters using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board HST have not\nfound a dichotomy in gamma', but instead a systematic progression from central\nluminosity deficit to excess relative to the inward extrapolation of the\nbest-fitting global Sersic model.

During gravitational\ncollapse, such magnetic fields can be amplified by compression and by\nturbulence, giving rise to the small-scale dynamo. On scales below the Jeans\nlength, the eddy turnover timescale is much shorter than the free-fall\ntimescale, so that saturation can be reached during collapse.

Since the number ~Npix^2 of terms in this sum exceeds\nthe number Npix of measurements, these ~Npix^2 terms cannot be statistically\nindependent. Therefore, the central-limit theorem does not necessarily apply,\nand the probability distribution function (PDF) for the fnl estimator does not\nnecessarily approach a Gaussian distribution for N_pix >> 1. Although the\nvariance of the estimators is known, the significance of a measurement of fnl\ndepends on knowledge of the full shape of its PDF. Here we use Monte Carlo\nrealizations of CMB maps to determine the PDF for two minimum-variance\nestimators: the standard estimator, constructed under the null hypothesis\n(fnl=0), and an improved estimator with a smaller variance for |fnl| > 0.

We have obtained a high-quality spectrum with full UV-NIR wavelength\ncoverage of galaxy NMBS-C7447 using X-Shooter on the VLT. We determined a\nvelocity dispersion of 294 +- 51 km/s. Given this velocity dispersion and the\neffective radius of 1.64 +- 0.15 kpc (as determined from HST-WFC3 F160W\nobservations) we derive a dynamical mass of 1.7 +- 0.5 x 10^11 Msun. Comparison\nof the full spectrum with stellar population synthesis models indicates that\nNMBS-C774 has a relatively young stellar population (0.40 Gyr) with little or\nno star formation and a stellar mass of ~1.5 x 10^11 Msun. The dynamical and\nphotometric stellar mass are in good agreement. Thus, our study supports the\nconclusion that the mass densities of quiescent galaxies were indeed higher at\nearlier times, and this earlier result is not caused by systematic measurement\nerrors. By combining available spectroscopic measurements at different\nredshifts, we find that the velocity dispersion at fixed dynamical mass was a\nfactor of ~1.8 higher at z=1.8 compared to z=0. Finally, we show that the\napparent discrepancies between the few available velocity dispersion\nmeasurements at z>1.5 are consistent with the intrinsic scatter of the\nmass-size relation. \n\n"}

Dynamical Evidence for a Range of Ages Being\n  Responsible for Extended Main Sequence Turnoffs Abstract: We present new analysis of 11 intermediate-age (1-2 Gyr) star clusters in the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud based on Hubble Space Telescope imaging data. Seven of\nthe clusters feature main sequence turnoff (MSTO) regions that are wider than\ncan be accounted for by a simple stellar population, whereas their red giant\nbranches indicate a single value of [Fe/H]. The star clusters cover a range in\npresent-day mass from about 1E4 to 2E5 solar masses.

We find\nthat such an infalling clump is extremely efficient in altering the structure\nof the halo and reducing its central density: a clump of 1% the mass of the\nhalo can remove about twice its own mass from the inner halo and transform a\ncusp into a core or weaker cusp.

However\nthe processes that lead to the observed correlations are contrary; the stellar\nlight that contributes to the optical is readily absorbed by dust which emits\nin the IR. Thus on small scales we expect these correlations to break down. We\nexamine seven nearby galaxies ranging from early- to late-types, on a\npixel-by-pixel basis and we demonstrate that there is disconnect between the\noptical and IR when normalized to the near-IR (H-band). We can decompose this\ndisconnect into two distinct components through a Principal Component Analysis\nof the H-band normalized SED of the pixels: one mainly correlated with\nvariations in the IR, the other correlated with variations in the optical. By\nmapping these two components it is clear they arise from distinct spatial\nregions. The IR dominated component is strongly associated with the specific\nstar-formation rate, while the optical-dominated component is broadly\nassociated with the stellar mass density. However, when the pixels of all\ngalaxies are compared, the well known optical-IR colour correlations return,\ndemonstrating that the variance observed within galaxies is around a mean which\nfollows the well-known trend.

These correlations arise from the differing contribution of stellar\nlight and dust to the IRAC bands, enabling us to determine pure stellar colours\nfor these bands, but still demonstrating the need for dust (or stellar)\ncorrections in these bands when being used as stellar (dust) tracers. \n\n"}

We have re-examined the\nevidence for the Bosma effect by fitting Bosma effect models for 17 galaxies in\nthe THINGS data set, either by scaling the contribution of the HI gas alone or\nby using both the observed stellar disc and HI gas as proxies. The results are\ncompared with two models for exotic cold DM: internally consistent cosmological\nNFW models with constrained compactness parameters, and URC models using fully\nunconstrained Burkert density profiles. The Bosma models that use the stellar\ndiscs as additional proxies are statistically nearly as good as the URC models\nand clearly better than the NFW ones.

Abstract: We explore the minimal conditions which enable the formation of\nmetal-enriched solar and sub-solar mass stars. We find that in the absence of\ndust grains, gas fragmentation occurs at densities nH ~ [10^4-10^5]cm^{-3} when\nthe metallicity exceeds Z ~ 10^{-4} Zsun. The resulting fragmentation masses\nare > 10 Msun. The inclusion of Fe and Si cooling does not affect the thermal\nevolution as this is dominated by molecular cooling even for metallicities as\nlarge as Z = 10^{-2} Zsun. The presence of dust is the key driver for the\nformation of low-mass stars. We focus on three representative core-collapse\nsupernova (SN) progenitors, and consider the effects of reverse shocks of\nincreasing strength: these reduce the depletion factors, fdep =\nMdust/(Mdust+Mmet), alter the shape of the grain size distribution function and\nmodify the relative abundances of grain species and of metal species in the gas\nphase. We find that the lowest metallicity at which fragmentation occurs is\nZ=10^{-6} Zsun for gas pre-enriched by the explosion of a 20 Msun primordial SN\n(fdep > 0.22) and/or by a 35 Msun, Z=10^{-4} Zsun SN (fdep > 0.26); it is ~ 1\ndex larger, when the gas is pre-enriched by a Z = 10^{-4} Zsun, 20 Msun SN\n(fdep > 0.04). Cloud fragmentation depends on the depletion factor and it is\nsuppressed when the reverse shock leads to a too large destruction of dust\ngrains. These features are all consistent with the existence of a minimum\ndust-to-gas ratio, Dcr, above which fragmentation is activated. We derive a\nsimple analytic expression for Dcr which, for grain composition and properties\nexplored in the present study, reads Dcr = [2.6 - 6.3] x 10^{-9}. When the\ndust-to-gas ratio of star forming clouds exceeds this value, the fragmentation\nmasses range between 0.01 Msun and 1 Msun, thus enabling the formation of the\nfirst low-mass stars. \n\n"}

We study if a\nuniversal law can account for the star formation relations observed for the\ndense molecular gas in normal star forming galaxies and extreme starbursts. We\nhave used the IRAM 30m telescope to observe a sample of 19 LIRGs in the 1-0\nlines of CO, HCN and HCO+. The analysis of the new data proves that the\nefficiency of star formation in the dense molecular gas (SFE-dense) of extreme\nstarbursts is a factor 3-4 higher compared to normal galaxies. We find a\nduality in Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) laws that is reinforced if we account for the\ndifferent conversion factor for HCN (alpha-HCN) in extreme starbursts and for\nthe unobscured star formation rate in normal galaxies. This result extends to\nthe higher molecular densities probed by HCN lines the more extreme bimodal\nbehavior of star formation laws, derived from CO molecular lines by two recent\nsurveys. We have confronted our observations with the predictions of\ntheoretical models in which the efficiency of star formation is determined by\nthe ratio of a constant star formation rate per free-fall time (SFR-ff) to the\nlocal free-fall time.

Such a trend requires neutron fluences larger than\nthose so far assumed, as these last would have too few neutrons per iron seed.\nWe suggest that the observed enhancements can be produced by nucleosynthesis in\nAGB stars of low mass (M < 1.5M\\odot), if they release neutrons from the\n^{13}C({\\alpha},n)^{16}O reaction in reservoirs larger by a factor of 4 than\nassumed in more massive AGBs (M > 1.5M\\odot).

The spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code\nRATRAN was used to reproduce the observed line profiles of HDO by assuming an\nabundance jump. To determine the H2O abundance throughout the envelope, a\nsimilar study was made of the H2-18O observed lines, as the H2O main isotope\nlines are contaminated by the outflows. We derive an inner HDO abundance of\n1.7e-7 and an outer HDO abundance of 8e-11. To reproduce the HDO absorption\nlines, it is necessary to add an absorbing layer in front of the envelope. It\nmay correspond to a water-rich layer created by the photodesorption of the ices\nat the edges of the molecular cloud. The HDO/H2O ratio is ~1.4-5.8% in the hot\ncorino whereas it is ~0.2-2.2% in the outer envelope. It is estimated at ~4.8%\nin the added absorbing layer. Although it is clearly higher than the cosmic D/H\nabundance, the HDO/H2O ratio remains lower than the D/H ratio derived for other\ndeuterated molecules observed in the same source. The similarity of the ratios\nderived in the hot corino and in the added absorbing layer suggests that water\nformed before the gravitational collapse of the protostar, contrary to\nformaldehyde and methanol, which formed later once the CO molecules had\ndepleted on the grains. \n\n"}

We identify the different dynamical\ncomponents at z=0 on the basis of both orbital parameters and the binding\nenergy of stars in the galaxy. In this way, we recognize a slowly rotating\ncentrally concentrated spheroid, and two disc components supported by rotation:\na thin disc with stars in nearly circular orbits, and a thick disc with orbital\nparameters transitional between the thin disc and the spheroid. The spheroidal\ncomponent is composed mainly by old, metal-poor and {\\alpha}-enhanced stars.\nThe distribution of metals in this component shows, however, a clear bimodality\nwith a low-metallicity peak, which could be related to a classical bulge, and a\nhigh-metallicity peak, which could be related to a pseudo-bulge. The thin disc\nappears in our simulations as the youngest and most metal-rich component. The\nradial distribution of ages and colours in this component are U-shaped: the new\nstars are forming in the inner regions, and then migrate through secular\nprocesses.

In the following, we will present evidence that accretion rate\nis also a key parameter for the presence of Hidden Broad Line Regions in\nSeyfert 2 galaxies. Our sample consists of 21 sources with polarized Hidden\nBroad Lines and 18 sources without Hidden Broad Lines. We use stellar velocity\ndispersions from several studies on the CaII and Mg b triplets in Seyfert 2\ngalaxies, to estimate the mass of the central black holes via the\nMbh-{\\sigma}\\ast relation. The ratio between the bolometric luminosity, derived\nfrom the intrinsic (i.e. unabsorbed) X-ray luminosity, and the Eddington\nluminosity is a measure of the rate at which matter accretes onto the central\nsupermassive black hole. A separation between Compton-thin HBLR and non-HBLR\nsources is clear, both in accretion rate (log Lbol/LEdd = -1.9) and in\nluminosity (log Lbol = 43.90). When, properly luminosity-corrected,\nCompton-thick sources are included, the separation between HBLR and non-HBLR is\nless sharp but no HBLR source falls below the Eddington ratio threshold.

For future applications of these novel statistics, we aim at a\nmore intuitive understanding of G3L to isolate the main features that possibly\ncan be measured. We construct a toy model (\"isolated lens model\"; ILM) for the\ndistribution of galaxies and associated matter to determine the measured\nquantities of the two G3L correlation functions and traditional galaxy-galaxy\nlensing (GGL) in a simplified context. The ILM presumes single lens galaxies to\nbe embedded inside arbitrary matter haloes that, however, are statistically\nindependent (\"isolated\") from any other halo or lens position. In the ILM, the\naverage mass-to-galaxy number ratio of clusters of any size cannot change. GGL\nand galaxy clustering alone cannot distinguish an ILM from any more complex\nscenario.

These\nspectral distortions depend on the shape and amplitude of the primordial power\nspectrum at wavenumbers k < 10^4 Mpc^{-1}. Here we study constraints on the\nprimordial power spectrum derived from COBE/FIRAS and forecasted for PIXIE. We\nshow that measurements of mu and y impose strong bounds on the integrated\nsmall-scale power, and we demonstrate how to compute these constraints using\nk-space window functions that account for the effects of thermalization and\ndissipation physics. We show that COBE/FIRAS places a robust upper limit on the\namplitude of the small-scale power spectrum. This limit is about three orders\nof magnitude stronger than the one derived from primordial black holes in the\nsame scale range. Furthermore, this limit could be improved by another three\norders of magnitude with PIXIE, potentially opening up a new window to early\nUniverse physics. To illustrate the power of these constraints, we consider\nseveral generic models for the small-scale power spectrum predicted by\ndifferent inflation scenarios, including running-mass inflation models and\ninflation scenarios with episodes of particle production.

We show that cooling of high-velocity,\nshocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances,\nincluding conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),\nresulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast\nenergy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler\ngas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity\nv_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the\nshocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal\npressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate\ndirectly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton\ncooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km\ns^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience\nenergy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions.

We emphasize the nonlinear interaction of rarefaction\nwaves excited at the interface between a cylindrical jet and the surrounding\nmedium. From simplified one-dimensional models with radial jet structure, we\nfind that a decrease in the relativistic pressure due to the interacting\nrarefaction waves in the central zone of the jet transiently yields a more\npowerful boost of the bulk jet than that expected from single rarefaction\nacceleration. This leads to a cyclic in-situ energy conversion between thermal\nand bulk kinetic energies which induces radial oscillating motion of the jet.\nThe oscillation timescale is characterized by the initial pressure ratio of the\njet to the ambient medium, and follows a simple scaling relation $\\tau_{\\rm\noscillation} \\propto (P_{\\rm jet,0}/P_{\\rm amb,0})^{1/2}$. It is confirmed from\nextended two-dimensional simulations that this radial oscillating motion in the\none-dimensional system manifests as modulation of the structure of the jet in a\nmore realistic situation where a relativistically hot jet propagates through an\nambient medium.

The difference between\nthe ongoing, instantaneous accretion rates witnessed at DAZ white dwarfs, which\noften exceed 1e8 g/s, and those inferred over the past 1e5-1e6 yr for the DBZ\nstars can be a few orders of magnitude, and therefore must result from\nhigh-rate episodes of tens to hundreds of years so they remain undetected to\ndate. This paper explores the likelihood that such brief, intense accretion\nepisodes of gas-phase material can account for existing data. For reasonable\nassumptions about the circumstellar gas, accretion rates approaching or\nexceeding 1e15 g/s are possible, similar to rates observed in quiescent\ncataclysmic variables, and potentially detectable with future x-ray missions or\nwide-field monitoring facilities.

Our results show that the\nmotion of the knots is essentially ballistic, with the exception of the\nfarthest knots, which trace the large scale C-shape bending of the jet. The\nobserved bending of the jet can be produced by a relative motion of the HH 30\nstar with respect to its surrounding environment, caused either by a possible\nproper motion of the HH 30 star, or by the entrainment of environment gas by\nthe red lobe of the nearby L1551-IRS 5 outflow. Alternatively, the bending can\nbe produced by the stellar wind from a nearby CTTS, identified in the 2MASS\ncatalog. The proper motion velocities of the knots of the counterjet show more\nvariations than those of the jet. In particular, we identify two knots of the\ncounterjet that have the same kinematic age but whose velocities differ by\nalmost a factor of two. Thus, it appears that counterjet knots launched\nsimultaneously can be ejected with very different velocities.

We find that only a small fraction (3%-11% depending on current sheet\nsize) of the energy is stored close enough to the current sheet to be\ndissipated abruptly by the reconnection process. The remaining energy, stored\nin the larger-scale field, is converted to kinetic energy in a fast\nmagnetosonic disturbance propagating away from the reconnection site, carrying\nthe initial current and generating reconnection-associated flows (inflow and\noutflow). Some of this reflects from the lower boundary (the photosphere) and\nrefracts back to the X-point reconnection site.

The star formation rate at redshifts z > 2 drops off\nrather more quickly than was thought even five years ago. Theoretical models\nhave tended to overpredict the star formation rate at these high redshifts\nsubstantially, primarily due to overcooling. Overcooling in galaxies typically\noccurs because of unphysical radiative cooling. As a result, insufficient\nturbulence is driven by stellar feedback. I show that such turbulence has the\nnet effect of strongly inhibiting star formation, despite its ability to\nlocally promote star formation by compression. Radiation pressure appears less\nlikely to be a dominant driver of the turbulence than has been argued, but\nsupernova and magnetorotational instabilities remain viable. Gravity alone\ncannot be the main driver, as otherwise well-resolved models without feedback\nwould accurately predict star formation rates.

Correlation does not, however,\nimply causation.

In this framework,\nscaling relations between observables (such as that between X-ray luminosity\nand temperature) are modelled explicitly in terms of the fundamental\nmass-observable scaling relations, and so are fully constrained without being\nfit directly. We apply the PICACS model to two observational datasets, and show\nthat it performs as well as traditional regression methods for simply measuring\nindividual scaling relation parameters, but reveals additional information on\nthe processes that shape the relations while providing self-consistent mass\nconstraints. Our analysis suggests that the observed combination of slopes of\nthe scaling relations can be described by a deficit of gas in low-mass clusters\nthat is compensated for by elevated gas temperatures, such that the total\nthermal energy of the gas in a cluster of given mass remains close to\nself-similar expectations. This is interpreted as the result of AGN feedback\nremoving low entropy gas from low mass systems, while heating the remaining\ngas. We deconstruct the luminosity-temperature (LT) relation and show that its\nsteepening compared to self-similar expectations can be explained solely by\nthis combination of gas depletion and heating in low mass systems, without any\nadditional contribution from a mass dependence of the gas structure. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that a self-consistent analysis of the scaling relations leads\nto an expectation of self-similar evolution of the LT relation that is\nsignificantly weaker than is commonly assumed. \n\n"}

The amplitude of this flow, as measured with Planck, is\nconsistent with earlier findings based on data from the Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe (WMAP).

Instead,\nthe evidence points to low [alpha/Fe] ratios resulting from an initial mass\nfunction (IMF) deficient in the highest mass stars. The critical evidence is\nthe 0.4 dex deficiency of [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and other hydrostatic elements,\ncontrasting with the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H]. Supporting\nevidence comes from the hydrostatic element (O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) [X/Fe] ratios,\nwhich are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW) disk trends. Also,\nthe ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti) element abundances suggests\na relatively top-light IMF. Abundance similarities with the LMC, Fornax and IC\n1613, suggest that their alpha-element deficiencies also resulted from IMFs\nlacking the most massive SNII.\n  For such a top-light IMF, the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H],\nas seen in Sgr, indicates that massive Type II supernovae (>30Msun) cannot be\nmajor sources of r-process elements.\n  High [La/Y] ratios, consistent with leaky-box chemical evolution, are\nconfirmed but ~0.3 dex larger than theoretical AGB predictions.

Sgr has\nthe lowest [Rb/Zr] ratios known, consistent with low-mass (~2Msun) AGB stars\nnear [Fe/H]=-0.6, likely resulting from leaky-box chemical evolution.\n  The [Cu/O] trend in Sgr and the MW suggest that Cu yields increase with both\nmetallicity and stellar mass, as expected from Cu production by the weak\ns-process in massive stars.\n  Finally, we present an updated hfs line list, an abundance analysis of\nArcturus, and further develop our error analysis formalism. \n\n"}

Due to cosmic\nvariance, for observers located in random haloes we show that the Hubble\nconstant determined from nearby SNIa may differ from that measured from the CMB\nby 0.8 per cent at 1sigma statistical significance. This scatter is too small\nto significantly alleviate a recently claimed discrepancy between current\nmeasurements assuming a flat LCDM model. However, for observers located in the\ncentres of the largest voids permitted by the standard LCDM model, we find that\nHubble constant measurements from SNIa would be biased high by 5 per cent,\nrendering this tension inexistent in this extreme case. \n\n"}

The nonlinear matter power spectrum\ncomputed in the halo model approach is found to be inaccurate in the mildly\nnonlinear regime, but captures reasonably well the effects of the Vainshtein\nscreening mechanism on small scales. In the Cubic model, the screening\nmechanism hides essentially all of the effects of the fifth force inside\nhaloes.

This result represents\na very significant step on the way to using the scaling law properties, proven\nin Episode 3 of this BdHN family, as a cosmological standard candle.\nCONCLUSIONS: Having identified GRB 090423 as a member of the BdHN family, we\ncan conclude that SN events, leading to NS formation, can already occur already\nat z=8.2, namely at 650 Myr after the Big Bang. It is then possible that these\nBdHNe originate stem from 40-60 M_{\\odot} binaries.

Motivations for violations of the notion of\nrelativistic locality include the Bell's inequalities for hidden variable\ntheories, the cosmological horizon problem, and Lorentz-violating approaches to\nquantum geometrodynamics, such as Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Here, we explore a\nrecent proposal for a \"real ensemble\" non-local description of quantum\nmechanics, in which \"particles\" can copy each others' observable values AND\nphases, independent of their spatial separation. We first specify the exact\ntheory, ensuring that it is consistent and has (ordinary) quantum mechanics as\na fixed point, where all particles with the same values for a given observable\nhave the same phases. We then study the stability of this fixed point\nnumerically, and analytically, for simple models.

For\ngeneric Dirac mass of the neutrinos, i.e. with all Yukawa couplings $\\lesssim\n10^{-5.5}$, it has been pointed out that successful leptogenesis requires a\nlower bound of 18 TeV on the $W_R$ mass, pushing it beyond the reach of LHC.\nSuch TeV-scale LRSM must, however, be parity-asymmetric for type-I seesaw to\ngive the observed neutrino masses. This class of models can accommodate larger\nYukawa couplings, which give simultaneous fits to charged-lepton and neutrino\nmasses, by invoking either cancellations or specific symmetry-textures for\nDirac ($M_D$) and Majorana ($M_N$) masses in the seesaw formula. We show that\nin this case, the leptogenesis bound on $M_{W_R}$ can be substantially weaker,\ni.e. $M_{W_R}\\gtrsim 3$ TeV for $M_N \\lesssim M_{W_R}$. This happens due to\nconsiderable reduction of the dilution effects from $W_R$-mediated decays and\nscatterings, while the washout effects due to inverse decays are under control\nfor certain parameter ranges of the Yukawa couplings. We also show that this\nmodel is consistent with all other low energy constraints, such as lepton\nflavor violation and neutrinoless double beta decay. Thus, a discovery of the\nright-handed gauge bosons alone at the LHC will not falsify leptogenesis as the\nmechanism behind the matter-antimatter asymmetry in our Universe. \n\n"}

We\nrevisit this topic, utilizing a set of propagation models fit to the cosmic ray\nboron, carbon, oxygen and beryllium data. We derive upper limits on the dark\nmatter annihilation cross section and find that when the cosmic ray propagation\nparameters are treated as nuisance parameters (as we argue is appropriate), the\nresulting limits are significantly less stringent than have been previously\nreported. We also note (as have several previous groups) that simple\nGALPROP-like diffusion-reacceleration models predict a spectrum of cosmic ray\nantiprotons that is in good agreement with PAMELA's observations above ~5 GeV,\nbut that significantly underpredict the flux at lower energies. Although the\ncomplexity of modeling cosmic ray propagation at GeV-scale energies makes it\ndifficult to determine the origin of this discrepancy, we consider the\npossibility that the excess antiprotons are the result of annihilating dark\nmatter.

Given these reaction pathways, the observed\nabundances of these molecules are useful in constraining both the total\ncosmic-ray ionization rate of atomic hydrogen (zeta_H) and molecular hydrogen\nfraction, f(H2).

Both OH+ and H2O+ are detected\nin absorption in multiple velocity components along every sight line, but H3O+\nis only detected along 7 sight lines. From the molecular abundances we compute\nf(H2) in multiple distinct components along each line of sight, and find a\nGaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation 0.042+-0.018.

Recent\ninvestigations on thermal timescale mass transfer in WD binaries demonstrate\nthat the resultant MSPs are likely to have relatively wide orbit periods\n($\\gtrsim 10$ days).

One such set of relations determines all of the multipole moments of a\nneutron star just from the first three (the mass monopole, the current dipole\nand the mass quadrupole moment) approximately independently of the equation of\nstate. These three-hair relations were found to hold in neutron stars that\nrotate rigidly, as is the case in old pulsars, but neutron stars can also\nrotate differentially, as is the case for proto-neutron stars and hypermassive\ntransient remnants of binary mergers. We here extend the three-hair relations\nto differentially rotating stars for the first time with a generic rotation law\nusing two approximations: a weak-field scheme (an expansion in powers of the\nneutron star compactness) and a perturbative differential rotation scheme (an\nexpansion about rigid rotation). These approximations allow us to analytically\nderive approximately universal relations that allow us to determine all of the\nmultipole moments of a (perturbative) differentially rotating star in terms of\nonly the first four moments. These new four-hair relations for differentially\nrotating neutron stars are found to be approximately independent of the\nequation of state to a higher degree than the three-hair relations for\nuniformly rotating stars. Our results can be instrumental in the development of\nfour-hair relations for rapidly differentially rotating stars in full General\nRelativity using numerical simulations. \n\n"}

This is\ninvoked in order to have enough material processed through first generation\nstars in order to form the observed numbers of enriched stars (inferred to be\nsecond generation stars in these models). If such mass loss was due to tidal\nstripping, gas expulsion, or tidal interaction with the birth environment,\nthere should be clear correlations between the fraction of enriched stars and\nother cluster properties, whereas the observations show a remarkably uniform\nenriched fraction of $0.68\\pm0.07$ (from 33 observed GCs).

We use the CANDELS\nnear-IR imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope to perform the bulge-to-disk\ndecomposition of distant galaxies and measure for the first time the slope of\nthe SFR-Mdisk relation at z=1. We find that this relation follows very closely\nthe shape of the SFR-M* correlation, still with a pronounced flattening at the\nhigh-mass end. This is clearly excluding, at least at z=1, the secular growth\nof quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies as the main driver for the change\nof slope of the Main Sequence. Then, by stacking the Herschel data available in\nthe CANDELS field, we estimate the total gas mass and the star formation\nefficiency at different positions on the SFR-M* relation. We find that the\nrelatively low SFRs observed in massive galaxies (M* > 5e10 Msun) are caused by\na decreased star formation efficiency, by up to a factor of 3 as compared to\nlower stellar mass galaxies, and not by a reduced gas content. The trend at the\nlowest masses is likely linked to the dominance of atomic over molecular gas.\nWe argue that this stellar-mass-dependent SFE can explain the varying slope of\nthe Main Sequence since z=1.5, hence over 70% of the Hubble time. The drop of\nSFE occurs at lower masses in the local Universe (M* > 2e10 Msun) and is not\npresent at z=2. Altogether this provides evidence for a slow downfall of the\nstar formation efficiency in massive Main Sequence galaxies. The resulting loss\nof star formation is found to be rising starting from z=2 to reach a level\ncomparable to the mass growth of the quiescent population by z=1.

In the recent Guo et\nal (2011) and Fu et al (2013) semi-analytic + N-body models, the gaseous\nenvironment of the satellite galaxy is governed by the properties of the dark\nmatter subhalo in which it resides. This quantity depends of the resolution of\nthe N-body simulation, leading to a divergent fraction of quenched satellites\nin high- and low-resolution simulations. Here, we incorporate an analytic model\nto trace the subhaloes below the resolution limit. We demonstrate that we then\nobtain better converged results between the Millennium I and II simulations,\nespecially for the satellites in the massive haloes ($\\rm log\nM_{halo}=[14,15]$). We also include a new physical model for the ram-pressure\nstripping of cold gas in satellite galaxies. However, we find very clear\ndiscrepancies with observed trends in quenched satellite galaxy fractions as a\nfunction of stellar mass at fixed halo mass. At fixed halo mass, the quenched\nfraction of satellites does not depend on stellar mass in the models, but\nincreases strongly with mass in the data. In addition to the over-prediction of\nlow-mass passive satellites, the models also predict too few quenched central\ngalaxies with low stellar masses, so the problems in reproducing quenched\nfractions are not purely of environmental origin.

With The Cannon, we\ntransfer information from the APOGEE survey to determine precise Teff, log g,\n[Fe/H], and [$\\alpha$/M] from the spectra of 450,000 LAMOST giants. The Cannon\nfits a predictive model for LAMOST spectra using 9952 stars observed in common\nbetween the two surveys, taking five labels from APOGEE DR12 as ground truth:\nTeff, log g, [Fe/H], [\\alpha/M], and K-band extinction $A_k$. The model is then\nused to infer Teff, log g, [Fe/H], and [$\\alpha$/M] for 454,180 giants, 20% of\nthe LAMOST DR2 stellar sample. These are the first [$\\alpha$/M] values for the\nfull set of LAMOST giants, and the largest catalog of [$\\alpha$/M] for giant\nstars to date. Furthermore, these labels are by construction on the APOGEE\nlabel scale; for spectra with S/N > 50, cross-validation of the model yields\ntypical uncertainties of 70K in Teff, 0.1 in log g, 0.1 in [Fe/H], and 0.04 in\n[$\\alpha$/M], values comparable to the broadly stated, conservative APOGEE DR12\nuncertainties.

In addition, Type Ibn SNe decline much faster than\nType IIn SNe, and this indicates that the interaction in Type Ibn SNe ceases\nearlier than in Type IIn SNe. Thus, we argue that Type Ibn SN progenitors\nexperience high mass-loss rates in a short period just before explosion, while\nType IIn SN progenitors have high mass-loss rates sustained for a long time.\nFurthermore, we show that rise time and peak luminosity of Type Ibn and Type\nIIn SNe are similar and thus, they have similar explosion properties and\ncircumstellar density.

The concept of mode projection has been introduced\nas a means to remove contaminants for which it is possible to construct a\nspatial map reflecting the expected signal contribution. Owing to its\ncomputational efficiency compared to minimum-variance methods, the sub-optimal\npseudo-Cl (PCL) power spectrum estimator is a popular tool for the analysis of\nhigh-resolution data sets. Here, we integrate mode projection into the\nframework of PCL power spectrum estimation.

Such models also provide a robust testing ground for the\nso-called stable clustering approximation, which gives simple predictions for\nthem. Studying large N-body simulations of such models with different force\nsmoothing, we find that these two issues are in fact very closely related: our\nconclusion is that the accuracy of two point statistics in the non-linear\nregime starts to degrade strongly around the scale at which their behaviour\ndeviates from that predicted by the stable clustering hypothesis. Physically\nthe association of the two scales is in fact simple to understand: stable\nclustering fails to be a good approximation when there are strong interactions\nof structures (in particular merging) and it is precisely such non-linear\nprocesses which are sensitive to fluctuations at the smaller scales affected by\ndiscretisation. Resolution may be further degraded if the short distance\ngravitational smoothing scale is larger than the scale to which stable\nclustering can propagate. We examine in detail the very different conclusions\nof studies by Smith et al. (2003) and Widrow et al.

However, for deep encounters leading to full\ndisruption in both theories, the stronger tidal forces in relativity imply that\nthe star is disrupted further from the black hole and that the debris is\ntherefore less tightly bound, leading to a smaller peak fallback accretion\nrate. We also examine the capture of tidal debris by the horizon and the\nrelativistic pericenter precession of tidal debris, finding that black holes of\n$10^6$ solar masses and above generate tidal debris precessing by $10^\\circ$ or\nmore per orbit. \n\n"}

Estimating covariances from numerical simulations improves\non these approximations, but the sample covariance estimator is inherently\nnoisy, which introduces uncertainties in the error bars on cosmological\nparameters and also additional scatter in their best fit values. For future\nsurveys, reducing both effects to an acceptable level requires an unfeasibly\nlarge number of simulations.\n  In this paper we describe a way to expand the true precision matrix around a\ncovariance model and show how to estimate the leading order terms of this\nexpansion from simulations.

The multistream field emerges at the nonlinear\nstage of the growth of perturbations because the dark matter is collisionless.\nCounting the number of velocity streams in gravitational collapses supplements\nour knowledge of spatial clustering. We assume that the virialized haloes have\nconvex boundaries. Closed and convex regions of the multistream field are hence\nisolated by imposing a positivity condition on all three eigenvalues of the\nHessian estimated on the smoothed multistream field. In a single-scale analysis\nof high multistream field resolution and low softening length, the halo\nsubstructures with local multistream maxima are isolated as individual halo\nsites. \n\n"}

CTA will have important synergies with many of\nthe new generation of major astronomical and astroparticle observatories.\nMulti-wavelength and multi-messenger approaches combining CTA data with those\nfrom other instruments will lead to a deeper understanding of the broad-band\nnon-thermal properties of target sources.\n  The CTA Observatory will be operated as an open, proposal-driven observatory,\nwith all data available on a public archive after a pre-defined proprietary\nperiod. Scientists from institutions worldwide have combined together to form\nthe CTA Consortium. This Consortium has prepared a proposal for a Core\nProgramme of highly motivated observations. The programme, encompassing\napproximately 40% of the available observing time over the first ten years of\nCTA operation, is made up of individual Key Science Projects (KSPs), which are\npresented in this document. \n\n"}

We explore the fraction of cool-core (CC) clusters in a large\nsample of $370$ clusters from IllustrisTNG, examining six common CC\ndefinitions. IllustrisTNG produces continuous CC criteria distributions, the\nextremes of which are classified as CC and non-cool-core (NCC), and the\ncriteria are increasingly correlated for more massive clusters. At $z=0$, the\nCC fractions for $2$ criteria are in reasonable agreement with the observed\nfractions but the other $4$ CC fractions are lower than observed. This result\nis partly driven by systematic differences between the simulated and observed\ngas fraction profiles. The simulated CC fractions with redshift show tentative\nagreement with the observed fractions, but linear fits demonstrate that the\nsimulated evolution is steeper than observed. The conversion of CCs to NCCs\nappears to begin later and act more rapidly in the simulations. Examining the\nfraction of CCs and NCCs defined as relaxed we find no evidence that CCs are\nmore relaxed, suggesting that mergers are not solely responsible for disrupting\nCCs.

Here, two approximations\nare applied to galaxy integrated star formation rate histories, drawn from a\nsemi-analytic model grafted onto a dark matter simulation. Both a lognormal\nfunctional form and principal component analysis (PCA) approximate the\nintegrated star formation rate histories fairly well. Machine learning, based\nupon simplified galaxy halo histories, is somewhat successful at recovering\nboth fits. The fits to the histories give fixed time star formation rates which\nhave notable scatter from their true fixed time rates at final time, especially\nfor quiescent and \"green valley\" galaxies, and more so for the PCA fit.

The heating is studied using a fully quantum approach taking\nconsistently into account nuclear shell effects.

Due to nuclear shell effects, the fully\naccreted crust is found to be much less stratified than in previous studies. In\nparticular, large regions of the inner crust contain clusters with the magic\nnumber $Z=14$. The heat deposited in the outer crust is tightly constrained by\nexperimental atomic mass data. The shallow heating we obtain does not exceed\n$0.2$~MeV and is therefore not enough to explain the cooling of some soft X-ray\ntransients.

We propose a\nmodel in which dust scattering is the dominant scattering and polarization\nmechanism in our targets, though electron scattering cannot be completely\nexcluded. Emission lines are polarized at a lower level than is the continuum.\nThis suggests that the emission-line region exists on similar spatial scales as\nthe scattering region. In three objects we detect an intriguing 90 degree swing\nin the polarization position angle as a function of line-of-sight velocity in\nthe emission lines of Ly-alpha, CIV and NV. We interpret this phenomenon in the\nframework of a geometric model with an equatorial dusty scattering region in\nwhich the material is outflowing at several thousand km/sec. Emission lines may\nalso be scattered by dust or resonantly. This model explains several salient\nfeatures of observations by scattering on scales of a few tens of pc. Our\nobservations provide a tantalizing view of the inner region geometry and\nkinematics of high-redshift obscured and extremely red quasars. Our data and\nmodeling lend strong support for toroidal obscuration and powerful outflows on\nthe scales of the UV emission-line region, in addition to the larger scale\noutflows inferred previously from the optical emission-line kinematics. \n\n"}

Three orbits for the collisional galaxy pair, on which\nclear and asymmetric rings form after collisions, are selected to perform the\n\\textit{N}-body simulations at different values of $B/D$ for the progenitor. It\nis found that the ring structures are the strongest for the CRGs with small\nvalues of $B/D$. The S\\'{e}rsic index, $n$, of the central remnant in the\ntarget galaxy becomes larger after collision. Moreover, the S\\'{e}rsic index of\na central remnant strongly correlates with the initial value of $B/D$ for the\nprogenitor.

Out of this sample 15 are identified as extreme oxygen emitters based on\ntheir O32 ratios (3.7%) and 104 galaxies have O32>1 (26%). Our analysis shows\nno significant correlation between M*, SFR, and the distance from the SFR-M*\nrelation with O32.

As young\nstars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on\npotentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these\nstrong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties\nof planetary systems.

We concentrate\non the development of the mean disk size in these environments.

Tracing these\nformer nuclei of stripped galaxies provides a unique way to track the assembly\nhistory of a galaxy or galaxy cluster. In this paper we present a new method to\nestimate how many UCDs host an SMBH in their center and thus are stripped\ngalaxy nuclei. We revisit the dynamical mass measurements that suggest many\nUCDs have more mass than expected from stellar population estimates, which\nrecent observations have shown is due to the presence of an SMBH. We revise the\nstellar population mass estimates using a new empirical relation between the\nmass-to-light ratio (M/L) and metallicity, and use this to predict which UCDs\nare most likely to host an SMBH. This enables us to calculate the fraction of\nUCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time.\nWe then apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function\nof UCDs and estimate that in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be\n$69^{+32}_{-25}$ stripped nuclei with SMBHs. This analysis shows that stripped\nnuclei with SMBHs are almost as common in clusters as present-day galaxy\nnuclei.

Abstract: We consider the possibility of an oscillating scalar field accounting for\ndark matter and dynamically controlling the spontaneous breaking of the\nelectroweak symmetry through a Higgs-portal coupling. This requires a late\ndecay of the inflaton field, such that thermal effects do not restore the\nelectroweak symmetry after reheating, and so inflation is followed by an\ninflaton matter-dominated epoch. During inflation, the dark scalar field\nacquires a large expectation value due to a negative non-minimal coupling to\ncurvature, thus stabilizing the Higgs field by holding it at the origin. After\ninflation, the dark scalar oscillates in a quartic potential, behaving as dark\nradiation, and only when its amplitude drops below a critical value does the\nHiggs field acquire a non-zero vacuum expectation value. The dark scalar then\nbecomes massive and starts behaving as cold dark matter until the present day.\nWe further show that consistent scenarios require dark scalar masses in the few\nGeV range, which may be probed with future collider experiments. \n\n"}

The first\none is a modification and improvement of a model by Del Popolo & Gambera(1999),\nnamely based upon a modification of the top-hat model in order to take account\nof angular momentum acquisition by protostructures and of an external pressure\nterm in the virial theorem. The second one is based on the merging-halo\nformalism of Lacey & Cole (1993), accounting for the fact that massive clusters\naccrete matter quasi-continuously, and is an improvement of a model proposed by\nVoit (2000). The final result is that, in both models, the M-T relation shows a\nbreak at T \\sim 3-4 keV. The behavior of the M-T relation is as usual, M\n\\propto T^{3/2}, at the high mass end, and M \\propto T^{\\gamma}, with a value\nof \\gamma>3/2 depending on the chosen cosmology. The evolution of the M-T\nrelation, for a given M_{\\rm vir}, is more modest both in flat and open\nuniverses in comparison to previous estimate found in literature, even more\nmodest than what found by V2000. Moreover the time evolution is more rapid in\nmodels with L=0 than in models in which the angular momentum acquisition by\nprotostructures is taken into account (L \\neq 0). The effect of a non-zero\ncosmological constant is that of slightly increasing the evolution of the M-T\nrelation with respect to open models with L \\neq 0.

First, by combining\nreal-time triggers from a wide area, multicolor search with deeper followup\nobservations, the light curve can be tracked for a time exceeding 2*t_1, where\nt_1 is the age of the event at first observation. Such a light curve allows\nsimultaneous fits to t_1 and the time decay slope alpha with sufficient\naccuracy to distinguish on- and off-axis orphans.

{"id": "astro-ph/0312165", "contents": "Title: Can satellites deliver substructures and black holes to inner halo by\n  dynamical friction? Abstract: A fully analytical formulation is developed to make dynamical friction\nmodeling more realistic. The rate for a satellite to decay its orbit in a host\ngalaxy halo is often severely overestimated when applying ChandraSekhar's\nformula without correcting for the tidal loss of the satellite and the\nadiabactic growth of the host galaxy potential over the Hubble time. As a\nsatellite decays to the inner and denser region of the host galaxy, the high\nambient density speeds up their exchange of energy and angular momentum, but\nshrinks the Roche lobe of the satellite by tides. Eventually both processes of\norbital decay and tidal stripping hang up altogether once the satellite is\nlight enough. These competing processes can be modeled analytically for a\nsatellite if we parametrize the massloss history by an empirical formula. We\nalso incorporate the adiabatic contraction of orbits due to growth of the host\npotential well. Observed dwarf galaxies often show a finite density core, which\ndetermines how much inwards its remnants could be delivered to the host galaxy.\nGhost streams or remnant cores or globular clusters of satellites should\npopulate preferentially the outer halo (e.g., the Magellanic stream and the\nUrsa Minor dwarf), rather than the inner halo (e.g., the Sgr stream and the\nOmega-cen cluster). Massloss due to strong tides in the inner galaxy also makes\nit problematic for any small central black holes in nuclei of satellite\ngalaxies to decay in orbit and merge into the center of the host galaxy. \n\n"}

The superhump\nperiod and period excess of TV Crv are accurately determined to be 0.065028 +/-\n0.000008 d and 0.0342 +/- 0.0021, respectively. This large excess implies a\nrelatively large mass ratio of the binary components (M_2/M_1), though it has a\nshort orbital period. The two types of superoutbursts can be explained by the\nthermal-tidal instability model for systems having large mass ratios. Our\nobservations reveal that superhump period derivatives are variable in distinct\nsuperoutbursts. The variation is apparently related to the presence or absence\nof a precursor. We propose that the superhump period derivative depends on the\nmaximum disk radius during outbursts. We investigate the relationship of the\ntype of superoutbursts and the superhump period derivative for known sources.\nIn the case of superoutbursts without a precursor, superhump period derivatives\ntend to be larger than those in precursor-main type superoutbursts, which is\nconsistent with our scenario. \n\n"}

We consider whether a nonradial mode\ncan serve as an explanation for burst oscillations from those NSs which are not\nmagnetic. We find that a surface wave in the shallow burning layer transitions\ninto a crustal interface wave as the envelope cools, a new and previously\nuninvestigated phenomenon. The surface modulations decrease dramatically as the\nmode switches, explaining why burst oscillations often disappear before burst\ncooling ceases. When we include rotational modifications, we find mode\nfrequencies and drifts consistent with those observed. The large NS spin\n($\\approx270-620 {\\rm Hz}$) needed to make this match implies that accreting\nNSs are spinning at frequencies $\\approx4 {\\rm Hz}$ above the burst\noscillation. Since the asymptotic frequency is set by the crustal interface\nwave, the observed late time frequency drifts are a probe of the composition\nand temperature of NS crusts.

Galactic Black Hole (GBH) power density spectra\n(PDS) are generally complex, and dependent on spectral state. In the low/hard\nstate the high-frequency rollover in the PDS moves in a way which is not simply\nrelated to luminosity. Hence this feature can only be used as an approximate\nindicator rather than as an accurate tracer of black hole mass in AGN. The\nX-ray spectrum in the high/soft state is dominated by the disc in GBH, which is\nrather stable. We show that the PDS of the Comptonized tail in GBH can be much\nmore variable, and that it is this which should be compared to AGN due to their\nmuch lower disc temperature. This bandpass effect removes a problem in\ninterpreting the (often highly variable) Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies\nas the counterparts of the high mass accretion rate GBH. Additionally, we\nspeculate that some NLS1 (e.g. Akn 564) are counterparts of the very high\nstate. The Comptonized tail in this state is also highly variable, but with PDS\nwhich can be roughly described as band-limited noise. This shape is similar to\nthat seen in the low/hard state, so merely seeing such band-limited noise in\nthe power spectrum of an AGN does not necessarily imply low luminosity. We also\nstress that Cyg X-1, often used for comparison with AGN, is not a typical black\nhole system due to its persistent nature. In particular, the shape of its power\nspectrum in the high/soft state is markedly different from that of other\n(transient) GBH systems in this state. The fact that the NLS1s NGC 4051 and\nMCG-6-30-15 do appear to show a power spectrum similar to that of the high/soft\nstate of Cyg X-1 may lend observational support to theoretical speculation that\nthe Hydrogen ionization disc instability does not operate in AGN. \n\n"}

It is proposed that the X-ray emission lines can be\nwell explained by the Geometry-Dominated models, but in these models the\nilluminating angle is much larger than that of the collimated jet of the\n$\\gamma$-ray bursts(GRBs). For GRB 011211, we obtain the illuminating angle is\nabout $\\theta\\sim45^{\\circ}$, while the angle of GRB jet is only $3.6^{\\circ}$,\nso we propose that the outflow of the GRBs with emission lines should have two\ndistinct components. The wide component illuminates the reprocessing material,\nand produces the emission lines, while the narrow one produces the $\\gamma$-ray\nbursts. The observations show that the energy for producing the emission lines\nis higher than that of the GRBs. In this case, when the wide component\ndominates the afterglows, a bump will appear in the GRBs afterglows. For GRB\n011211, the emergence time of the bump is less than 0.05 days after the GRB, it\nis obviously too early for the observation to catch it.

{"id": "astro-ph/0509235", "contents": "Title: Nonlinear shock acceleration beyond the Bohm limit Abstract: We suggest a physical mechanism whereby the acceleration time of cosmic rays\nby shock waves can be significantly reduced. This creates the possibility of\nparticle acceleration beyond the knee energy at ~10^15eV. The acceleration\nresults from a nonlinear modification of the flow ahead of the shock supported\nby particles already accelerated to the knee momentum at p ~ p_*. The particles\ngain energy by bouncing off converging magnetic irregularities frozen into the\nflow in the shock precursor and not so much by re-crossing the shock itself.\nThe acceleration rate is thus determined by the gradient of the flow velocity\nand turns out to be formally independent of the particle mean free path\n(m.f.p.). The velocity gradient is, in turn, set by the knee-particles at p ~\np_* as having the dominant contribution to the CR pressure. Since it is\nindependent of the m.f.p., the acceleration rate of particles above the knee\ndoes not decrease with energy, unlike in the linear acceleration regime. The\nreason for the knee formation at p ~ p_* is that particles with $p > p_*$ are\neffectively confined to the shock precursor only while they are within limited\ndomains in the momentum space, while other particles fall into\n``loss-islands'', similar to the ``loss-cone'' of magnetic traps. This\nstructure of the momentum space is due to the character of the scattering\nmagnetic irregularities. They are formed by a train of shock waves that\nnaturally emerge from unstably growing and steepening magnetosonic waves or as\na result of acoustic instability of the CR precursor. These losses steepen the\nspectrum above the knee, which also prevents the shock width from increasing\nwith the maximum particle energy. \n\n"}

The initial configurations are assumed to be remnants of binary\nneutron star (NS) or NS+BH mergers and consist of a 4 solar mass BH with varied\nspin, girded by a torus with a mass between 0.01 and 0.2 solar masses. The\nevolution of tori without and with physical shear viscosity is simulated, using\na realistic equation of state and following the energy loss and lepton number\nchange due to neutrino emission by a neutrino-trapping scheme. The\ntime-dependent efficiency of converting rest-mass energy to neutrinos is found\nto reach 10 percent, the efficiency of converting neutrino energy into a\npair-photon fireball by neutrino annihilation can reach several percent. The\nrate of the latter process declines with time much less steeply than the total\nneutrino luminosity, because the ongoing protonization of the torus ensures a\nrather stable product of neutrino and antineutrino luminosities.

The X-ray light-curves of these 2 bursts both show remarkably steep\nearly decays (F(t)\\propto t^{-3}), breaking to flatter slopes on timescales of\na few hundred seconds. For GRB050126 the burst shows no evidence of spectral\nevolution in the 20-150 keV band, and the spectral index of the gamma-ray and\nX-ray afterglows are significantly different suggesting a separate origin. By\ncontrast the BAT spectrum of GRB050219A displays significant spectral\nevolution, becoming softer at later times, with Gamma evolving toward the XRT\nphoton index seen in the early X-ray afterglow phase. For both bursts, the\n0.2-10 keV spectral index pre- and post-break in the X-ray decay light-curve\nare consistent with no spectral evolution. We suggest that the steep early\ndecline in the X-ray decay light-curve is either the curvature tail of the\nprompt emission; X-ray flaring activity; or external forward shock emission\nfrom a jet with high density regions of small angular size (> Gamma^{-1}). The\nlate slope we associate with the forward external shock. \n\n"}

Abstract: Recently, there have been suggestions that the apparent accelerated expansion\nof the universe is not caused by repulsive gravitation due to dark energy, but\nis rather a result of inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter. In this\nwork, we investigate the behaviour of a dust dominated inhomogeneous\nLemaitre-Tolman-Bondi universe model, and confront it with various\nastrophysical observations. We find that such a model can easily explain the\nobserved luminosity distance-redshift relation of supernovae without the need\nfor dark energy, when the inhomogeneity is in the form of an underdense bubble\ncentered near the observer. With the additional assumption that the universe\noutside the bubble is approximately described by a homogeneous Einstein-de\nSitter model, we find that the position of the first CMB peak can be made to\nmatch the WMAP observations. Whether or not it is possible to reproduce the\nentire CMB angular power spectrum in an inhomogeneous model without dark\nenergy, is still an open question. \n\n"}

Using a correction of -1.0 dex to account for 3D effects on OH\nline formation, the abundances are lowered to [O/Fe] = 2.8 and [O/Fe] = 2.5,\nrespectively, which we adopt. Without 3D corrections, the UV-OH based abundance\nwould be in disagreement with the upper limits derived from the OI triplet\nlines: [O/Fe]_trip < 2.8 (subgiant) and [O/Fe]_trip < 3.0 (dwarf).

However, only the V/Vmax method is\nusually employed in computing the white dwarf luminosity function and other\nmethods have not been applied so far to the observational sample of\nspectroscopically identified white dwarfs. Moreover, the statistical\nsignificance of the white dwarf luminosity function has also received little\nattention and a thorough study still remains to be done. In this paper we\nstudy, using a controlled synthetic sample of white dwarfs generated using a\nMonte Carlo simulator, which is the statistical significance of the white dwarf\nluminosity function and which are the expected biases. We also present a\ncomparison between different estimators for computing the white dwarf\nluminosity function.

Our analysis is based on new spectroscopic data\nobtained at the TNG telescope for 93 galaxies and on new photometric data\nobtained at the INT telescope. We combine galaxy velocity and position\ninformation to select 68 cluster members, determine global dynamical\nproperties, and detect possible substructures.

With the exception of eta Crv, these objects are\nyoung with ages <50 Myr.

We have modeled the excess continua using a continuous disk with a\nuniform surface density distribution, expected if Poynting-Robertson and\nstellar wind drag are the dominant grain removal processes, and using a single\ntemperature black body, expected if the dust is located in a narrow ring around\nthe star. The IRS spectra of many objects are better modeled with a single\ntemperature black body, suggesting that the disks possess inner holes. The\ndistribution of grain temperatures, based on our black body fits, peaks at Tgr\n= 110 - 130 K. Since the timescale for ice sublimation of micron-sized grains\nwith Tgr > 110 K is a fraction of a Myr, the lack of warmer material may be\nexplained if the grains are icy. If planets dynamically clear the central\nportions of debris disks, then the frequency of planets around other stars is\nprobably high.

In this work the\npredictions of that model are tested using the largest numerical experiments of\nsupersonic hydrodynamic (HD) and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence to date\n(~1000^3 computational zones) and three different codes (Enzo, Zeus and the\nStagger Code). The model predicts a power law distribution for large masses,\nrelated to the turbulence energy power spectrum slope, and the shock jump\nconditions. This power law mass distribution is confirmed by the numerical\nexperiments. The model also predicts a sharp difference between the HD and MHD\nregimes, which is recovered in the experiments as well, implying that the\nmagnetic field, even below energy equipartition on the large scale, is a\ncrucial component of the process of turbulent fragmentation. These results\nsuggest that the stellar IMF of primordial stars may differ from that in later\nepochs of star formation, due to differences in both gas temperature and\nmagnetic field strength.

These observations\nsupersede previous WFPC2 images which revealed the presence of a population of\nmetal-rich globular clusters (GCs) of intermediate age (~1.5-4 Gyr). We detect\na total of 580 GC candidates, 46% more than from the previous WFPC2 images.

Peak colors in V-I are 0.93 +/-0.01 and 1.09\n+/- 0.01 for the blue and red subpopulations, respectively. The luminosity\nfunction (LF) of the inner 50% of the metal-rich (`red') population of GCs\ndiffers markedly from that of the outer 50%. In particular, the LF of the inner\n50% of the red GCs shows a flattening consistent with a turnover that is about\n1.0 mag fainter than the turnover of the blue GC LF. This is consistent with\npredictions of recent models of GC disruption for the age range mentioned above\nand for metallicities that are consistent with the peak color of the red GCs as\npredicted by population synthesis models.

These moving groups are\nresponsible for the vertex deviation measured even for samples of late-type\nstars; they appear more frequently for ever redder samples; and as a whole they\nfollow an asymmetric-drift relation, in the sense that those only present in\nred samples predominantly have large |v_R| and lag in v_phi w.r.t. the local\nstandard of rest (LSR).

We compare the two-points correlation function, that we obtain\ntaking account of non-radial motions, with that obtained by Sutherland &\nEfstathiou (1991) from the analysis of Geller & Hucra's (1988) deep redshift\nsurvey and with the data points for the APM clusters obtained by Efstathiou et\nal.

We reported the detection of 110 Lya\nabsorbers at significance level >3 sigma in the redshift range z=0.002-0.069,\nover a total pathlength of 116,000 km/s. In this second paper, we evaluate the\nphysical properties of these Lya absorbers and compare them to their high-z\ncounterparts. The distribution of Doppler parameters is similar to that at high\nredshift, with mean b = 35.0 +- 16.6 km/s. The true Doppler parameter may be\nsomewhat lower, owing to component blends and non-thermal velocities. The\ndistribution of equivalent widths exhibits a significant break at W~133mA, with\nan increasing number of weak absorbers (10mA-100mA).
