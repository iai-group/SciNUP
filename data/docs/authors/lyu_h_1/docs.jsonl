For the shape consisting of $n=\\omega_d r^d$\nsites, where $\\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\\R^d$, we show that\nthe inradius of the set of occupied sites is at least $r-O(\\log r)$, while the\noutradius is at most $r+O(r^\\alpha)$ for any $\\alpha > 1-1/d$.

Each pair of particles occupying neighboring sites has a negative\nbinding energy provided their types are different, while each particle has a\npositive activation energy that depends on its type. There is no binding energy\nbetween particles of the same type. At the boundary of the box particles are\ncreated and annihilated in a way that represents the presence of an infinite\ngas reservoir. We start the dynamics from the empty box and are interested in\nthe transition time to the full box. This transition is triggered by a critical\ndroplet appearing somewhere in the box. In the first paper we identified the\nparameter range for which the system is metastable, showed that the first\nentrance distribution on the set of critical droplets is uniform, computed the\nexpected transition time up to and including a multiplicative factor of order\none, and proved that the nucleation time divided by its expectation is\nexponentially distributed, all in the limit of low temperature.

The main result of this work is that if the degree\nsequence of the random graph follows a power law with exponent $\\beta$, where\n$2 < \\beta < 3$, then a sublinear number of initially infected vertices is\nenough to spread the infection over a linear fraction of the nodes of the\nrandom graph, with high probability.\n  More specifically, we determine explicitly a critical function $a_c(n)$ such\nthat $a_c(n)=o(n)$ with the following property.

We call it the\nintermediate disorder regime. It is accessed by scaling the inverse temperature\nparameter $\\beta$ to zero as the polymer length $n$ tends to infinity. The\nnatural choice of scaling is $\\beta_n:=\\beta n^{-1/4}$. We show that the\npolymer measure under this scaling has previously unseen behavior. While the\nfluctuation exponents of the polymer endpoint and the log partition function\nare identical to those for simple random walk ($\\zeta=1/2,\\chi=0$), the\nfluctuations themselves are different. These fluctuations are still influenced\nby the random environment, and there is no self-averaging of the polymer\nmeasure. In particular, the random distribution of the polymer endpoint\nconverges in law (under a diffusive scaling of space) to a random absolutely\ncontinuous measure on the real line. The randomness of the measure is inherited\nfrom a stationary process $A_{\\beta}$ that has the recently discovered\ncrossover distributions as its one-point marginals, which for large $\\beta$\nbecome the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution. We also prove existence of a limiting\nlaw for the four-parameter field of polymer transition probabilities that can\nbe described by the stochastic heat equation.

As a consequence of the study of the large\npopulation limit, global existence of a nonnegative weak solution to a\nmultidimensional parabolic strongly coupled model of competing species is\nproved. The main new feature of the corresponding integro-differential equation\nis the nonlocal nonlinearity appearing in the diffusion terms, which may depend\non the spatial densities of all population types. Moreover, the diffusion\nmatrix is generally not strictly positive definite and the cross-diffusion\neffect allows for linearly growing influences of the subpopulations' sizes. We\nprove uniqueness of the finite measure-valued solution and give conditions\nunder which the solution takes values in a functional space.

The intuitive\nexplanation for the poor delay characteristics is that (i) high load requires a\nhigh activity factor, (ii) a high activity factor implies extremely slow\ntransitions between dominant activity states, and (iii) slow transitions cause\nstarvation and hence excessively long queues and delays. Our proof method\ncombines both renewal and conductance arguments. A critical ingredient in\nquantifying the long transition times is the derivation of the communication\nheight of the uniformized Markov chain associated with the activity process. We\nalso discuss connections with Glauber dynamics, conductance and mixing times.\nOur proof framework can be applied to other topologies as well, and is also\nrelevant for the hard-core model in statistical physics and the sampling from\nindependent sets using single-site update Markov chains. \n\n"}

The case $N=2$ corresponds to the\nperturbed Tanaka's equation recently studied by Prokaj \\cite{MR18} and Le\nJan-Raimond \\cite{MR000} among others. It is proved that $(\\hbox{ISDE})$ has a\nunique in law solution, which is a Walsh's Brownian motion. This solution is\nstrong if and only if $N=2$.\n  Solution flows are also considered.

{"id": "1404.3749", "contents": "Title: High-dimensional estimation with geometric constraints Abstract: Consider measuring an n-dimensional vector x through the inner product with\nseveral measurement vectors, a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. It is common in both signal\nprocessing and statistics to assume the linear response model y_i = <a_i, x> +\ne_i, where e_i is a noise term. However, in practice the precise relationship\nbetween the signal x and the observations y_i may not follow the linear model,\nand in some cases it may not even be known. To address this challenge, in this\npaper we propose a general model where it is only assumed that each observation\ny_i may depend on a_i only through <a_i, x>. We do not assume that the\ndependence is known. This is a form of the semiparametric single index model,\nand it includes the linear model as well as many forms of the generalized\nlinear model as special cases. We further assume that the signal x has some\nstructure, and we formulate this as a general assumption that x belongs to some\nknown (but arbitrary) feasible set K. We carefully detail the benefit of using\nthe signal structure to improve estimation. The theory is based on the mean\nwidth of K, a geometric parameter which can be used to understand its effective\ndimension in estimation problems. We determine a simple, efficient two-step\nprocedure for estimating the signal based on this model -- a linear estimation\nfollowed by metric projection onto K. We give general conditions under which\nthe estimator is minimax optimal up to a constant. This leads to the intriguing\nconclusion that in the high noise regime, an unknown non-linearity in the\nobservations does not significantly reduce one's ability to determine the\nsignal, even when the non-linearity may be non-invertible.

Currently the detector consists of 44 antennas connected to\nair-Cherenkov and scintillator detectors, respectively, placed in the Tunka\nvalley, Siberia.

However, the\ndata also potentially contains signals, thus the background estimate may be\noverstated due to contributions from signals. It has been proposed to mitigate\npossible bias by removing single-detector data samples that pass a\nmulti-detector consistency test from the background estimates. We conduct a\nhigh-statistics Mock Data Challenge to evaluate the effects of removing such\nsamples, modelling a range of scenarios with plausible detector noise\ndistributions and with a range of plausible foreground astrophysical signal\nrates. We consider the two different modes: one in which coincident samples are\nremoved, and one in which all samples are retained and used. Three algorithms\nwere operated in both modes, show good consistency with each other; however,\ndiscrepancies arise between the results obtained under the \"coincidence\nremoval\" and \"all samples\" modes, for false alarm probabilities below a certain\nvalue. In most scenarios the median of the false alarm probability (FAP)\nestimator under the \"all samples\" mode is consistent with the exact FAP.

To improve parallelism and\ntherefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom\nlayer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final\ntranslation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference\ncomputations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited\nset of common sub-word units (\"wordpieces\") for both input and output.

Compared with text sources come from other domains, the\nmedical text is special and has unique characteristics. In addition, the\nmedical text mining poses more challenges, e.g., more unstructured text, the\nfast growing of new terms addition, a wide range of name variation for the same\ndrug. The mining is even more challenging due to the lack of labeled dataset\nsources and external knowledge, as well as multiple token representations for a\nsingle drug name that is more common in the real application setting. Although\nmany approaches have been proposed to overwhelm the task, some problems\nremained with poor F-score performance (less than 0.75). This paper presents a\nnew treatment in data representation techniques to overcome some of those\nchallenges. We propose three data representation techniques based on the\ncharacteristics of word distribution and word similarities as a result of word\nembedding training. The first technique is evaluated with the standard NN\nmodel, i.e., MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptrons). The second technique involves two\ndeep network classifiers, i.e., DBN (Deep Belief Networks), and SAE (Stacked\nDenoising Encoders). The third technique represents the sentence as a sequence\nthat is evaluated with a recurrent NN model, i.e., LSTM (Long Short Term\nMemory). In extracting the drug name entities, the third technique gives the\nbest F-score performance compared to the state of the art, with its average\nF-score being 0.8645. \n\n"}

In order to then analyze the family\nstructure in this coding we introduce an algebraic structure on um-spaces (a\nconsistent collection of semigroups). This allows us to obtain a path of\ncollections of subfamilies of fixed kinship h (described as ultrametric measure\nspaces), for every depth h as a measurable functional of the genealogy. Random\nelements in the semigroup are studied, in particular infinitely divisible\nrandom variables.

This paper introduces SWESA (Supervised Word\nEmbeddings for Sentiment Analysis), an algorithm for sentiment analysis via\nword embeddings. SWESA leverages document label infor- mation to learn vector\nrepresentations of words from a modest corpus of text doc- uments by solving an\noptimization prob- lem that minimizes a cost function with respect to both word\nembeddings as well as classification accuracy.

While seemingly simple, the problem\ninvolves certain time inconsistency issue, and the value function naturally\nrelies on the distribution of the state process and thus is a solution to a\nnonlinear master equation. Consequently, the optimal state process solves a\nMcKean-Vlasov SDE. In the general case that $T$ is larger than $H$, the master\nequation becomes path-dependent and the corresponding McKean-Vlasov SDE\ninvolves the conditional distribution of the state process. We shall build\nthese connections rigorously, and obtain the existence of classical solution of\nthese nonlinear (path-dependent) master equations in a special case. \n\n"}

Since the same SQL query may have multiple equivalent\nserializations, training a sequence-to-sequence-style model is sensitive to the\nchoice from one of them. This phenomenon is documented as the \"order-matters\"\nproblem. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on reinforcement learning to\nreward the decoder when it generates any of the equivalent serializations.\nHowever, we observe that the improvement from reinforcement learning is\nlimited.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, i.e., SQLNet, to fundamentally\nsolve this problem by avoiding the sequence-to-sequence structure when the\norder does not matter.

This paper proposes a new\nneural architecture for recommendation with reviews. Our model operates on a\nmulti-hierarchical paradigm and is based on the intuition that not all reviews\nare created equal, i.e., only a select few are important. The importance,\nhowever, should be dynamically inferred depending on the current target. To\nthis end, we propose a review-by-review pointer-based learning scheme that\nextracts important reviews, subsequently matching them in a word-by-word\nfashion. This enables not only the most informative reviews to be utilized for\nprediction but also a deeper word-level interaction. Our pointer-based method\noperates with a novel gumbel-softmax based pointer mechanism that enables the\nincorporation of discrete vectors within differentiable neural architectures.\nOur pointer mechanism is co-attentive in nature, learning pointers which are\nco-dependent on user-item relationships. Finally, we propose a multi-pointer\nlearning scheme that learns to combine multiple views of interactions between\nuser and item.

Short bursts of selection acting in opposing directions\ndrive to maintain both types at intermediate frequencies, while the\nfluctuations due to 'genetic drift' work to eliminate variation in the\npopulation.\n  We consider first a population with no spatial structure, modelled by an\nadaptation of the Lambda (or generalised) Fleming-Viot process, and derive a\nstochastic differential equation as a scaling limit. This amounts to a limit\nresult for a Lambda-Fleming-Viot process in a rapidly fluctuating random\nenvironment. We then extend to a population that is distributed across a\nspatial continuum, which we model through a modification of the spatial\nLambda-Fleming-Viot process with selection.

The method is based on\nthe comparison of predictions for radio pulse shapes by CoREAS simulations to\nmeasured pulses. We applied our method to the data of Tunka-Rex, a 1 km$^2$\nradio array in Siberia operating in the frequency band of 30-80 MHz. Tunka-Rex\nis triggered by the air-Cherenkov detector Tunka-133 and by scintillators\n(Tunka-Grande). The instrument collects air-shower data since 2012. The present\npaper describes updated data and signal analyses of Tunka-Rex and details of a\nnew method applied. After efficiency cuts, when Tunka-Rex reaches its full\nefficiency, the energy resolution of about 10% given by the new method has\nreached the limit of systematic uncertainties due to the calibration\nuncertainty and shower-to-shower fluctuations. At the same time the shower\nmaximum reconstruction is significantly improved up to an accuracy of 35\ng/cm$^2$ compared to the previous method based on the slope of the lateral\ndistribution. We also define and now achieved conditions of the measurements,\nat which the shower maximum resolution of Tunka-Rex reaches a value of 25\ng/cm$^2$ and becomes competitive to optical detectors. To check and validate\nour reconstruction and efficiency cuts we compare individual events to the\nreconstruction of Tunka-133. Furthermore, we compare the mean of shower maximum\nas a function of primary energy to the measurements of other experiments. \n\n"}

As the rate\nof astrophysical sources increases, the probability that a signal will occur at\nthe same time as a glitch also increases. This has occurred previously in the\ngravitational wave binary neutron star detection GW170817.

We empirically show that this degeneracy\noccurs mostly due to two reasons. First, the expressive power of hierarchical\nRNN decoders is often high enough to model the data using only its decoding\ndistributions without relying on the latent variables.

We propose \\emph{ClassiNet} -- a network of\nclassifiers trained for predicting missing features in a given instance, to\novercome the feature sparseness problem. Using a set of unlabeled training\ninstances, we first learn binary classifiers as feature predictors for\npredicting whether a particular feature occurs in a given instance. Next, each\nfeature predictor is represented as a vertex $v_i$ in the ClassiNet where a\none-to-one correspondence exists between feature predictors and vertices. The\nweight of the directed edge $e_{ij}$ connecting a vertex $v_i$ to a vertex\n$v_j$ represents the conditional probability that given $v_i$ exists in an\ninstance, $v_j$ also exists in the same instance. We show that ClassiNets\ngeneralize word co-occurrence graphs by considering implicit co-occurrences\nbetween features.

Using data from the GMRT we show\nthat post-correlation beamformation results in a many-folds increase in the\nsignal-to-noise for periodic signals from pulsars and several order of\nmagnitude reduction in the number of false triggers from single pulse events\nlike fast radio bursts (FRBs). This difference arises primarily because the\npost-correlation beam contains less red-noise, as well as less radio frequency\ninterference. The post-correlation beam can also be more easily calibrated than\nthe incoherent or phased array beams. We also discuss two different modes of\npost-correlation beamformation, viz.

Recently, GANs have been\nextended from generating images to generating sequences (e.g., poems, music and\ncodes). Existing GANs on sequence generation mainly focus on general sequences,\nwhich are grammar-free. In many real-world applications, however, we need to\ngenerate sequences in a formal language with the constraint of its\ncorresponding grammar. For example, to test the performance of a database, one\nmay want to generate a collection of SQL queries, which are not only similar to\nthe queries of real users, but also follow the SQL syntax of the target\ndatabase. Generating such sequences is highly challenging because both the\ngenerator and discriminator of GANs need to consider the structure of the\nsequences and the given grammar in the formal language. To address these\nissues, we study the problem of syntax-aware sequence generation with GANs, in\nwhich a collection of real sequences and a set of pre-defined grammatical rules\nare given to both discriminator and generator. We propose a novel GAN\nframework, namely TreeGAN, to incorporate a given Context-Free Grammar (CFG)\ninto the sequence generation process.

The\ndiscriminator uses a tree-structured RNN to distinguish the generated trees\nfrom real trees.

This process has been analyzed in the\nphysics literature under the name \"random walk with preferential relocations\",\nwhere it is argued that the position of the walker after $n$ steps, scaled by\n$\\log n$, converges to a Gaussian random variable; because of the $\\log$\nspatial scaling, the process is said to undergo a \"slow diffusion\".\n  In this paper, we generalize this model by allowing the underlying random\nwalk to be any Markov process and the random run-lengths (time between two\nrelocations) to be i.i.d.-distributed.

The data collected at the Observatory over the last decade\nshow the suppression of the cosmic ray flux at energies above $4\\times10^{19}$\neV. However, it is still unclear if this suppression is caused by the\npropagation of cosmic rays or rather by energy limitation of their sources. The\nother puzzle is the origin of UHECRs. Some clues can be drawn from studying the\ndistribution of their arrival directions. The recently observed dipole\nanisotropy has an orientation which indicates an extragalactic origin of\nUHECRs.

We establish that\nthis model goes through a phase transition at $p_c=1/4$ between a subcritical\nregime where every particle eventually annihilates, and a supercritical regime\nwhere a positive density of static particles is never hit, confirming 1990s\npredictions of Droz et al. for the particular case of a Poisson process.

It collects samples from a networked population\nby incentivizing participants to refer their friends into the study. One major\nchallenge in analyzing RDS samples is seed bias. Seed bias refers to the fact\nthat when the social network is divided into multiple communities (or blocks),\nthe RDS sample might not provide a balanced representation of the different\ncommunities in the population, and such unbalance is correlated with the\ninitial participant (or the seed). In this case, the distributions of\nestimators are typically non-trivial mixtures, which are determined (1) by the\nseed and (2) by how the referrals transition from one block to another. This\npaper shows that (1) block-transition probabilities are easy to estimate with\nhigh accuracy, and (2) we can use these estimated block-transition\nprobabilities to estimate the stationary distribution over blocks and thus, an\nestimate of the block proportions.

In the present report, we explain interesting connections among\nrepresentation theory, probability theory, and random matrix theory using this\nsimple diffusion particle system. Each vicious walk of $N$ walkers is\nrepresented by an $N$-tuple of nonintersecting lattice paths on the\nspatio-temporal plane. There is established a simple bijection between\nnonintersecting lattice paths and semistandard Young tableaux. Based on this\nbijection and some knowledge of symmetric polynomials called the Schur\nfunctions, we can give a determinantal expression to the partition function of\nvicious walks, which is regarded as a special case of the Karlin-McGregor\nformula in the probability theory (or the Lindstr\\\"om-Gessel-Viennot formula in\nthe enumerative combinatorics).

It is known that, apart from\na technicality, independent of the starting configuration, at each time, the\nnumber of chips on each vertex in the Propp model deviates from the expected\nnumber of chips in the random walk model by at most a constant.
