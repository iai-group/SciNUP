This result\nnot only supports the earlier finding that the azimuthal and polar widths of\nthese subbeams narrow with distance (as R^(-3) and R^(-1), respectively), but\nalso implies that the boundary contribution to the solution of the wave\nequation governing the radiation field does not always vanish in the limit\nwhere the boundary tends to infinity. There is a fundamental difference between\nthe classical expressions for the retarded potential and field: while the\nboundary contribution for the potential can always be made zero via a gauge\ntransformation preserving the Lorenz condition, that for the field may be\nneglected only if it diminishes with distance faster than the contribution of\nthe source density in the far zone. In the case of a rotating superluminal\nsource, however, the boundary term in the retarded solution for the field is by\na factor of order R^(1/2) larger than the source term of this solution in the\nlimit, which explains why an argument based on the solution of the wave\nequation governing the field that neglects the boundary term (such as that\npresented by J. H. Hannay) misses the nonspherical decay of the field. Given\nthat the distribution of the radiation field of an accelerated superluminal\nsource in the far zone is not known a priori, the only way to calculate the\nfree-space radiation field of such sources is via the retarded solution for the\npotential.

We highlight\nprocesses that could affect the WD shear, during accretion as well as during\nthe ~1000 years of pre-explosive simmering. Baroclinic instabilities and/or the\nshear growth of small magnetic fields provide sufficient torque to bring the WD\nvery close to solid body rotation during accretion. The lack of significant\nshear makes it difficult to grow a WD substantially past the typical\nChandrasekhar mass. Once carbon ignites, a convective region spreads from the\nWD's center.

Our observations of HI selected galaxies in the\nlight of H-alpha and the far-ultraviolet (FUV) challenge this notion. The flux\nratio H-alpha/FUV from these two star formation tracers shows strong\ncorrelations with the surface-brightness in H-alpha and the R band: Low Surface\nBrightness (LSB) galaxies have lower ratios compared to High Surface Brightness\ngalaxies and to expectations from equilibrium star formation models using\ncommonly favored IMF parameters. Weaker but significant correlations of\nH-alpha/FUV with luminosity, rotational velocity and dynamical mass are found\nas well as a systematic trend with morphology. The correlated variations of\nH-alpha/FUV with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family of\ngalaxy scaling relations. The H-alpha/FUV correlations can not be due to dust\ncorrection errors, while systematic variations in the star formation history\ncan not explain the trends with both H-alpha and R surface brightness. LSB\ngalaxies are unlikely to have a higher escape fraction of ionizing photons\nconsidering their high gas fraction, and color-magnitude diagrams. The most\nplausible explanation for the correlations are systematic variations of the\nupper mass limit and/or slope of the IMF at the upper end. We outline a\nscenario of pressure driving the correlations by setting the efficiency of the\nformation of the dense star clusters where the highest mass stars form. Our\nresults imply that the star formation rate measured in a galaxy is highly\nsensitive to the tracer used in the measurement.

The internal pressures of\nthe knots exceed that of the ambient ISM or the equipartition pressure of the\nNML by more than an order of magnitude, demonstrating that they must be short\nlived ($\\sim3\\times10^6$ yrs).

The light curve\nconsists of two narrow peaks of similar amplitude separated by 0.468 +/- 0.002\nin phase. The first peak lags the maximum of the 2 GHz radio pulse by 0.162 +/-\n0.004 +/- 0.01 in phase. The integral gamma-ray photon flux above 100 MeV is\n(56 +/- 3 +/- 11) x 10^{-8} /cm2/s.

The photon index is \\Gamma = 1.5 +/-\n0.1 +/- 0.1 and the exponential cut-off is E_c = 2.4 +/- 0.3 +/- 0.5 GeV. The\nfirst uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic.

Abstract: (abridged) We apply the Jeans equation to estimate masses for eight of the\nbrightest dSph galaxies. For Fornax we obtain a model-independent constraint on\nthe maximum-circular velocity, Vmax=18_{-3}^{+5} km/s. Although we obtain only\nlower-limits of Vmax > 10 km/s for the remaining dSphs, we find that in all\ncases the enclosed mass at the projected half-light radius is well constrained\nand robust to a wide range of halo models and velocity anisotropies. We derive\na simple analytic formula that estimates M(rhalf) accurately with respect to\nresults from the full Jeans analysis. Applying this formula to the entire\npopulation of Local Group dSphs, we demonstrate a correlation such that\nM(rhalf)\\propto rhalf^{1.4\\pm 0.4}, or in terms of the mean density interior to\nthe half-light radius, <rho> \\propto rhalf^{-1.6\\pm 0.4}. This relation is\ndriven by the fact that the dSph data exhibit a correlation between global\nvelocity dispersion and half-light radius. We argue that tidal forces are\nunlikely to have introduced this relation, but tides may have increased the\nscatter and/or altered the slope. While the data are well described by mass\nprofiles ranging over a factor of < 2 in normalization (Vmax ~ 10-20 km/s), we\nconsider the hypothesis that all dSphs are embedded within a \"universal\" dark\nmatter halo.

The model galaxy is employed from an ultra-high-resolution\nchemodynamic simulation of a primordial galaxy by Mori & Umemura (2006),which\nwell reproduces the observed properties of LAEs and LBGs. The total mass of\nmodel galaxy is 10^{11}M_sun. We solve not only photo-ionization but also\ncollisional ionization by shocks. In addition, according to the chemical\nenrichment, we incorporate the effect of dust extinction, taking the size\ndistributions of dust into account. As a result, we find that dust extinction\nreduces the escape fractions by a factor 1.5-8.5 in the LAE phase and by a\nfactor 2.5-11 in the LBG phase, while the collisional ionization by shocks\nincreases the escape fractions by a factor ~ 2. The resultant escape fractions\nare 0.07-0.47 in the LAE phase and 0.06-0.17 in the LBG phase. These results\nare well concordant with the recent estimations derived from the flux ratio at\n1500 angstrom to 900 angstrom of LAEs and LBGs.

Broadband (4-200 keV)\nspectra, fitted with an exponentially cutoff powerlaw, show that the hard\nspectral component steepens during the transition from the hard to the soft\nstate. The high-energy cutoff decreased monotonically from 120 to 60 keV during\nthe brightening of the hard state, but increased again to 100 keV during the\nsoftening in the hard intermediate state.

Observations of the non-thermal radio and X-ray emission spectra\nas well as the H.E.S.S. measurements of the very high energy gamma-ray emission\nare used to constrain the astronomical and CR acceleration parameters of the\nsystem.

It is in addition assumed that the CR\ninjection/acceleration takes place uniformly across the shock surface for this\nkind of core collapse SNR. The theory gives a consistent description for all\nthe existing observational data, including the non-detection of thermal X-rays\nand the spatial correlation of the X-ray and gamma-ray emission in the remnant.\nSpecifically it is shown that an efficient production of nuclear CRs, leading\nto strong shock modification and a large downstream magnetic field strength B_d\n~140 mkG can reproduce in detail the observed synchrotron emission from radio\nto X-ray frequencies together with the gamma-ray spectral characteristics as\nobserved by the H.E.S.S. telescopes.

Among other known HII regions\nIC131-se seems to be extreme regarding the combination of its large extent of\nthe X-ray plasma, the lack of massive O stars, its unusually high electron\ntemperature (if thermal), and the large fraction of L_X emitted above 2keV\n(~40-53%).

The metallicity evolution of the\ngas inside galaxies is broadly consistent with observations, but the diffuse\nIGM is under enriched at z $\\sim$ 2.5.

This is likely because of the decrease in star\nformation activity and in wind escape efficiency. Metals enhance cooling which\nallows WHIM gas to cool onto galaxies and increases star formation.

Internal two-body relaxation and external shocks will lead to\nfurther, gradual dissolution on timescales of up to a few hundred million years\nfor low-mass open clusters in the Milky Way, while the most massive clusters (>\n10^5 Msun) have lifetimes comparable to or exceeding the age of the Universe.\nThe low-mass end of the initial cluster mass function is well approximated by a\npower-law distribution, dN/dM ~ M^{-2}, but there is mounting evidence that\nquiescent spiral discs form relatively few clusters with masses M > 2 x 10^5\nMsun.

We study a toy model where the flow behind a planar\nstationary accretion shock is adiabatically decelerated by an external\npotential. Two magnetic field geometries are considered: parallel or\nperpendicular to the shock. The entropy-vorticity wave, which is simply\nadvected in the unmagnetized limit, separates into five different waves: the\nentropy perturbations are advected, while the vorticity can propagate along the\nfield lines through two Alfven waves and two slow magnetosonic waves. The two\ncycles existing in the unmagnetized limit, advective-acoustic and purely\nacoustic, are replaced by up to six distinct MHD cycles.

Accurate calculation of large\n$\\ell$ multipoles requires N-body simulations and ray-tracing schemes with both\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. To this end we have developed a new code\nthat combines a gravitational Adaptive Particle-Particle, Particle-Mesh (AP3M)\nsolver with a weak lensing evaluation routine. The lensing deviations are\nevaluated while structure evolves during the simulation so that all evolution\nsteps--rather than just a few outputs--are used in the lensing computations.\nThe new code also includes a ray-tracing procedure that avoids periodicity\neffects in a universe that is modeled as a 3-D torus in the standard way.\nResults from our new simulations are compared with previous ones based on\nParticle-Mesh simulations. We also systematically investigate the impact of box\nvolume, resolution, and ray-tracing directions on the variance of the computed\npower spectra. We find that a box size of $512 h^{-1}$ Mpc is sufficient to\nprovide a robust estimate of the weak lensing angular power spectrum in the\n$\\ell$-interval (2,000--7,000).

In this Letter we\nstudy the gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV from IC 443 as obtained by the AGILE\nsatellite. A distinct pattern of diffuse emission in the energy range 100 MeV-3\nGeV is detected across the SNR with its prominent maximum (source \"A\")\nlocalized in the Northeastern shell with a flux F = (47 \\pm 10) 10^{-8} photons\ncm^{-2} s^{-1} above 100 MeV.

We identify significant\nsystematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additional\ndiffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-ray\nhaze. To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the\nratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,\nand of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models\nand simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to\nunder-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate\nit at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend\ncrucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy. The size of\nthe systematic effects we find are comparable to the size of the claimed \"Fermi\nhaze\" signal. We thus conclude that a detailed model for the galactic diffuse\nemission is necessary in order to conclusively assess the presence of a\ngamma-ray excess possibly associated to the WMAP haze morphology. \n\n"}

Much of the analysis relates to the 'high energy' cosmic\nrays ($E>10^{14}eV;=0.1PeV$) and their variability due to the changing\nproximity of the solar system to supernova remnants which are generally\nbelieved to be responsible for most cosmic rays up to PeV energies. It is\npointed out that, on a statistical basis, there will have been considerable\nvariations in the likely 100 My between the Earth's biosphere reaching\nreasonable stability and the onset of very elementary life. Interestingly,\nthere is the increasingly strong possibility that PeV cosmic rays are\nresponsible for the initiation of terrestrial lightning strokes and the\npossibility arises of considerable increases in the frequency of lightnings and\nthereby the formation of some of the complex molecules which are the 'building\nblocks of life'. Attention is also given to the well known generation of the\noxides of nitrogen by lightning strokes which are poisonous to animal life but\nhelpful to plant growth; here, too, the violent swings of cosmic ray\nintensities may have had relevance to evolutionary changes. A particular\nvariant of the cosmic ray acceleration model, put forward by us, predicts an\nincrease in lightning rate in the past and this has been sought in Korean\nhistorical records.

We propose a strategy\nto distinguish between dark matter annihilation and/or decay in the case that a\nclear signal is detected in gamma-ray observations of Milky Way dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies with gamma-ray experiments. The sole measurement of the\nenergy spectrum of an indirect signal would render the discrimination between\nthese cases impossible.

Single-pointing spectra of the SiO J=2-1 and J=3-2 lines toward\nseveral regions in the filament, are also reported. The SiO images reveal that\nSiO is widespread along the IRDC (size >2 pc), showing two different\ncomponents: one bright and compact arising from three condensations (N, E and\nS), and the other weak and extended along the filament. While the first\ncomponent shows broad lines (linewidths of ~4-7 kms-1) in both SiO J=2-1 and\nSiO J=3-2, the second one is only detected in SiO J=2-1 and has narrow lines\n(~0.8 kms-1). The maps of CO and its isotopologues show that low-density\nfilaments are intersecting the IRDC and appear to merge toward the densest\nportion of the cloud. This resembles the molecular structures predicted by\nflow-driven, shock-induced and magnetically-regulated cloud formation models.\nAs in outflows associated with low-mass star formation, the excitation\ntemperatures and fractional abundances of SiO toward N, E and S, increase with\nvelocity from ~6 to 40 K, and from ~1E-10 to >1E-8 respectively, over a\nvelocity range of ~7 kms-1. Since 8 micron sources, 24 micron sources and/or\nextended 4.5 micron emission are detected in N, E and S, broad SiO is likely\nproduced in outflows associated with high-mass protostars. The excitation\ntemperatures and fractional abundances of the narrow SiO lines, however, are\nvery low (~9 K and ~1E-11, respectively), and consistent with the processing of\ninterstellar grains by the passage of a shock with vs~12 kms-1.

We argue that previous\nattempts to form disc galaxies have been unsuccessful because of the universal\nadoption of strong feedback combined with high star formation efficiencies.\nUnless extreme amounts of energy are injected into the interstellar medium\nduring supernovae events, these star formation parameters result in bulge\ndominated S0/Sa galaxies as star formation is too efficient at z~3. We show\nthat a low efficiency of star-formation more closely models the subparsec\nphysical processes, especially at high redshift.

For this purpose we use a suite of large\ncosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the OWLS project. We improve on\nprevious work by considering a wider range of halo masses and redshifts, by\ndistinguishing accretion onto haloes and galaxies, by including important\nfeedback processes, and by comparing simulations with different physics. The\nspecific rate of gas accretion onto haloes is, like that for dark matter, only\nweakly dependent on halo mass. For halo masses Mhalo>>10^11 Msun it is\nrelatively insensitive to feedback processes. In contrast, accretion rates onto\ngalaxies are determined by radiative cooling and by outflows driven by\nsupernovae and active galactic nuclei. Galactic winds increase the halo mass at\nwhich the central galaxies grow the fastest by about two orders of magnitude to\nMhalo~10^12 Msun. Gas accretion is bimodal, with maximum past temperatures\neither of order the virial temperature or <~10^5 K. The fraction of gas\naccreted on to haloes in the hot mode is insensitive to feedback and metal-line\ncooling. It increases with decreasing redshift, but is mostly determined by\nhalo mass, increasing gradually from less than 10% for ~10^11 Msun to greater\nthan 90% at 10^13 Msun. In contrast, for accretion onto galaxies the cold mode\nis always significant and the relative contributions of the two accretion modes\nare more sensitive to feedback and metal-line cooling. The majority of stars\npresent in any mass halo at any redshift were formed from gas accreted in the\ncold mode, although the hot mode contributes typically over 10% for\nMhalo>~10^11 Msun. Galaxies, but not necessarily their gaseous haloes, are\npredominantly fed by gas that did not experience an accretion shock when it\nentered the host halo. \n\n"}

Moreover, although sulfur is\nnot significantly bound in dust grains in the ISM, it seems to behave\ndifferently in DLAs and in old metal-poor stars. We aim to determine precise S\nabundance in a sample of extremely metal-poor stars taking into account NLTE\nand 3D effects.

For all these spectra, microturbulent velocity has been\nderived by using the two approaches and compared with the original value with\nwhich the synthetic spectra have been generated.

The luminosity of M31N 2007-12b during maximum was at\nthe Eddington limit of a massive WD and dropped by ~30% in the observation 60 d\nafter outburst. The radius of the emission region is ~6x10^8 cm. In the four\nbright state observations, we detected a stable 1110 s pulsation, which we\ninterpret as the WD rotation period.

The point source was also detected in follow-up higher\nfrequency(1170 MHz) observations. The spectral index for the point source\nobtained from the GMRT observations is alpha = -2.1. The steep spectrum, as\nwell as the location of the point source near the centre of the SNR establish\nthe fact that it is indeed the pulsar J2022+3842 associated with this SNR.\nConsistent with this, subsequent analysis of archival Chandra X-ray data shows\na point source coincident with the radio point source, as well as diffuse\nextended X-ray emission surrounding the unresolved source. However, no pulsed\nemission was detected despite deep searches at both 610 MHz and 1160 MHz\nalthough pulsed emission has been seen at 2 GHz with the GBT. It appears that\nthe most likely reason for not detecting the pulsed signal at the GMRT is\ntemporal broadening: for the estimated DM towards this SNR, the pulse\nbroadening time could be as large as tens of milliseconds. The diffuse X-ray\nemission is elongated along the same direction as the bipolar structure seen in\nthe radio. We interpret the radio lobes as having been formed from an\nequatorial wind.

The\ndifferential rotation and meridional circulation are intimately linked, with a\ncommon origin in the turbulent stresses of the upper solar convection zone. The\nexistence and structure of the NSSL cannot be attributed to the conservation of\nangular momentum by solar surface convection, as is often supposed. Rather, the\nturbulent angular momentum transport accounts for the poleward meridional flow\nwhile the often overlooked meridional force balance maintains the mid-latitude\nrotational shear. We suggest that the base of the NSSL is marked by a\ntransition from baroclinic to turbulent stresses in the meridional plane which\nsuppress Coriolis-induced circulations that would otherwise establish a\ncylindrical rotation profile. The turbulent angular momentum transport must be\nnon-diffusive and directed radially inward. Inferred mean flows are consistent\nwith the idea that turbulent convection tends to mix angular momentum but only\nif the mixing efficiency is inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic. The latitudinal\nand longitudinal components of the estimated turbulent transport are comparable\nin amplitude and about an order of magnitude larger than the vertical\ncomponent. We estimate that it requires 2--4% of the solar luminosity to\nmaintain the solar NSSL against the inertia of the mean flow.

The 680 identified bona-fide PMS stars show a bimodal age distribution,\nwith two roughly equally numerous populations peaked respectively at ~1 Myr,\nand ~20 Myr. We use the age and other physical properties of these PMS stars to\nstudy how star formation has proceeded across time and space in NGC 346. We\nfind no correlation between the locations of young and old PMS stars, nor do we\nfind a correspondence between the positions of young PMS stars and those of\nmassive OB stars of similar age. Furthermore, the mass distribution of stars\nwith similar age shows large variations throughout the region.

In the previous paper\nof this series we defined UFOs as those absorbers with an outflow velocity\nhigher than 10,000km/s and assessed the statistical significance of the\nassociated blueshifted FeK absorption lines in a large sample of 42 local\nradio-quiet AGNs observed with XMM-Newton.

We confirm that the frequency of sources in the\nradio-quiet sample showing UFOs is >35%. The outflow velocity distribution\nspans from \\sim10,000km/s (\\sim0.03c) up to \\sim100,000km/s (\\sim0.3c), with a\npeak and mean value of \\sim42,000km/s (\\sim0.14c).

We\nuse dynamical arguments to derive an analytic formula that can be fitted to\nobserved velocity distributions, and validate it by fits to the velocities\nderived from a dynamically rigorous model, and to a sample of local stars with\naccurate space velocities. Our formula is much easier to use than a full\ndistribution function. It has fewer parameters than a multi-Gaussian fit, and\nthe best-fitting model parameters give insight into the underlying disc\ndynamics. In particular, once the azimuthal velocities of a sample have been\nsuccessfully fitted, the apparatus provides a prediction for the corresponding\ndistribution of radial velocities vR . An effective formula like ours is\ninvaluable when fitting to data for stars at some distance from the Sun because\nit enables one to make proper allowance for the errors in distance and proper\nmotion when determining the underlying disc kinematics.

The temperature-density relation of the gas is\nfound to fan out and flatten following HeII reionization, with an inversion for\noverdensities above 5.

In the companion paper Guo &\nMathews (Paper I), we use hydrodynamic simulations to show that they could be\nproduced by a recent powerful AGN jet event. Here we further explore this\nscenario to study the potential roles of shear viscosity and cosmic ray (CR)\ndiffusion on the morphology and CR distribution of the bubbles. We show that\neven a relatively low level of viscosity (\\mu_{visc} >~ 3 g cm^{-1} s^{-1}, or\n~0.1% - 1% of Braginskii viscosity in this context) could effectively suppress\nthe development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the bubble surface,\nresulting in smooth bubble edges as observed. Furthermore, viscosity reduces\ncirculating motions within the bubbles, which would otherwise mix the\nCR-carrying jet backflow near bubble edges with the bubble interior. Thus\nviscosity naturally produces an edge-favored CR distribution, an important\ningredient to produce the observed flat gamma-ray surface brightness\ndistribution. Generically, such a CR distribution often produces a\nlimb-brightened gamma-ray intensity distribution. However, we show that by\nincorporating CR diffusion which is strongly suppressed across the bubble\nsurface (as inferred from sharp bubble edges) but is close to canonical values\nin the bubble interior, we obtain a reasonably flat gamma-ray intensity\nprofile. The similarity of the resulting CR bubble with the observed Fermi\nbubbles strengthens our previous result in Paper I that the Fermi bubbles were\nproduced by a recent AGN jet event.

In this paper, we study the properties of the\nmodel, by varying the mass of the galaxy, the star formation rate, and the\nefficiency of star formation. Our main results are the following: (1) For a\ngiven star formation efficiency f*, a more extended period of active star\nformation tends to produce a galactic wind that reaches a larger extent. If f*\nis sufficiently large, the energy deposited by the stars completely expels the\nISM. Eventually, the ISM is being replenished by mass loss from supernovae and\nstellar winds. (2) For galaxies with masses above 10^11 Msun, the material\nejected in the IGM always falls back onto the galaxy. Hence lower-mass galaxies\nare the ones responsible for enriching the IGM. (3) Stellar winds play a minor\nrole in the dynamical evolution of the galactic wind, because their energy\ninput is small compared to supernovae. However, they contribute significantly\nto the chemical composition of the galactic wind. We conclude that the history\nof the ISM enrichment plays a determinant role in the chemical composition and\nextent of the galactic wind, and therefore its ability to enrich the IGM. \n\n"}

In this paper, we positionally associate the recent\nunambiguously short-hard Swift GRB 100206A with a disk galaxy at redshift\nz=0.4068 that is rapidly forming stars at a rate of ~30 M_sun/yr, almost an\norder of magnitude higher than any previously identified short GRB host. Using\nphotometry from Gemini, Keck, PAIRITEL, and WISE, we show that the galaxy is\nvery red (g-K = 4.3 AB mag), heavily obscured (A_V ~ 2 mag), and has the\nhighest metallicity of any GRB host to date (12 + log[O/H]_KD02 = 9.2): it is a\nclassical luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG), with L_IR ~ 4 x 10^11 L_sun. While\nthese properties could be interpreted to support an association of this GRB\nwith very recent star formation, modeling of the broadband spectral energy\ndistribution also indicates that a substantial stellar mass of mostly older\nstars is present. The current specific star-formation rate is modest (specific\nSFR ~ 0.5 Gyr^-1), the current star-formation rate is not substantially\nelevated above its long-term average, and the host morphology shows no sign of\nrecent merger activity. Our observations are therefore equally consistent with\nan older progenitor, similar to what is inferred for other short-hard GRBs.\nGiven the precedent established by previous short GRB hosts and the significant\nfraction of the Universe's stellar mass in LIRG-like systems at z >~0.3, an\nolder progenitor represents the most likely origin of this event. \n\n"}

Like that example, however,\nthis solution does not resolve the 'cloud in cloud' problem; it also does not\nextend to large scales that dominate the velocity/density fluctuations. In\nprinciple, these can change the results at the order-of-magnitude level. Here,\nwe use the results from Hopkins 2011 (H11) to generalize the excursion set\nformalism and derive the exact solution in this regime. We argue that the\nstellar IMF and core mass function (CMF) should be associated with the\nlast-crossing distribution, i.e. the mass spectrum of bound objects defined on\nthe smallest scale on which they are self-gravitating. This differs from the\nfirst-crossing distribution (mass function on the largest self-gravitating\nscale) which is defined cosmologically and which H11 show corresponds to the\nGMC mass function in disks. We derive an analytic equation for the\nlast-crossing distribution that can be used for an arbitrary collapse threshold\nin ISM and cosmological studies.

The only adjustable parameter in the model is the turbulent\nvelocity power spectrum, which in the range p~5/3-2 gives similar results. We\nalso use this to justify why the approximate solution in HC08 is reasonable (up\nto a normalization) over the CMF/IMF mass range; however there are significant\ncorrections at intermediate and high masses.

We find that the X-ray\nbroad-band energy spectra during these spectral transitions can be adequately\nreproduced by a composition of a low-temperature blackbody component, a\nComptonized component (COMPTB) and Gaussian component. We argue that the\nelectron temperature kT_e of the Compton cloud monotonically increases from 2.3\nkeV to 4.5 keV, when GX~3+1 makes a spectral transition. Using a disk seed\nphoton normalization of COMPTB, which is proportional to mass accretion rate,\nwe find that the photon power-law index Gamma is almost constant (Gamma=2.00+/-\n0.02) when mass accretion rate changes by factor 4. We interpret this\nquasi-stability of the index Gamma and a particular form of the spectrum in the\nframework of a model in which the energy release in the transition layer\nlocated between the accretion disk and neutron star surface dominates that in\nthe disk.

For a given bandpass, the absolute SBF\nmagnitude \\bar{M} depends on the properties of the underlying stellar\npopulation. Multi-band SBFs allow scientists to probe different stages of the\nstellar evolution: UV and blue wavelength band SBFs are sensitive to the\nevolution of stars within the hot Horizontal Branch (HB) and post-Asymptotic\nGiant Branch (post-AGB) phase, whereas optical SBF magnitudes explore the stars\nwithin the Red Giant Branch (RGB) and HB regime. Near- and Far-infrared SBF\nluminosities probe the important stellar evolution stage within the AGB and\nThermally-Pulsating Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) phase. Since the first\nsuccessful application by Tonry and Schneider, a multiplicity of works have\nused this method to expand the distance scale up to 150 Mpc and beyond. This\narticle gives a historical background of distance measurements, reviews the\nbasic concepts of the SBF technique, presents a broad sample of these\ninvestigations and discusses possible selection effects, biases, and\nlimitations of the method.

For the\nlarge majority of stars with masses 0.7 < M/M_sun < 0.9 and heavy-element mass\nfractions 0.001 < Z < 0.006, the Li abundance is well fitted by a relation\nA(Li) = a0 + a1 M + a2 Z + a3 M Z, where a0, a1, a2, and a3 are constants.\nExtrapolating this relation to Z = 0 leads to a Li abundance close to the\nprimordial value predicted from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis calculations\nand the WMAP baryon density. The relation, however, does not apply to stars\nwith [Fe/H] < -1.5. We suggest that metal-rich halo stars were formed with a Li\nabundance close to the primordial value, and that lithium in their atmospheres\nhas been depleted in time with an approximately linear dependence on stellar\nmass and Z.

One important question is\nwhether the chemical abundances in this star reflect the chemical composition\nof the gas cloud from which it was formed or if they have been severely\naffected by other processes, such as dust-gas winnowing. Aims: We measure or\nprovide an upper limit to the abundance of the volatile element sulphur, which\ncan help to discriminate between the two scenarios. Methods: We observed HE\n1327-2326 with the high resolution infra-red spectrograph CRIRES at the VLT to\nobserve the S I lines of Multiplet 3 at 1045 nm. Results: We do not detect the\nS I line.

The formation of dust in the atmosphere versus an origin of the\nmetals in a metal-poor supernova with extensive \"fall-back\" are not mutually\nexclusive.

Building a\ncoherent picture of how star clusters form and evolve is therefore critical to\nour overall understanding of the star formation process. Most clusters disrupt\nafter they form, thus contributing to the field star population.

The ensuing collision between the fast ejecta and the CSM causes an\nincrease in brightness observed at the end of 1844, followed by a sustained\nhigh-luminosity phase lasting for 10-15 years that matches the historical light\ncurve. The emergent luminosity is powered by CSM interaction, analogous to the\nprocess in luminous Type IIn supernovae, except with 10 times lower explosion\nenergy and at slower speeds (causing a longer duration and lower emergent\nluminosity). Such an explosive event provides a natural explanation for the\nlight curve evolution, but also accounts for a number of puzzling attributes of\nthe Homunculus nebula: (1) rough equipartition of total radiated and kinetic\nenergy, (2) the double-shell structure of the Homunculus, (3) the apparent\nsingle age and Hubble-like flow resulting from the thin swept-up shell, (4) the\ncomplex mottled appearance of the polar lobes in HST images, arising from\nRaleigh-Taylor or Vishniac instabilities, (5) efficient and rapid dust\nformation, as seen in Type IIn supernovae, and (6) the fast (5000 km/s)\nmaterial outside the Homunculus, arising from the acceleration of the forward\nshock upon exiting the dense CSM.

We find that a circular binary system with a\nmisaligned circumbinary disk normally produces a double peaked\nmass-accretion-rate variation per binary orbit. This is because each black hole\npasses across the circumbinary disk plane and captures gas twice in one orbital\nperiod. Even in misaligned systems, however, a single peaked\nmass-accretion-rate variation per binary orbit is produced, if the orbital\neccentricity is moderately large (e\\lesssim0.3).

We find that the slope of the mass function for this cluster is\n\\alpha = 1.7 +/- 0.2, which is steeper than previously reported, but still\nflatter than the traditional Salpeter slope of 2.35. The age of the cluster is\nbetween 2.5-5.8 Myr with 95% confidence, which is a younger age than typically\nadopted but consistent within the uncertainties of past measurements. The exact\nage of the cluster is difficult to determine since our results show two\ndistinct age solutions (3.9 Myr and 2.8 Myr) due to model degeneracies in the\nrelative number of Wolf-Rayet and OB stars. The total cluster mass is between\n14,000 - 37,000 \\msun above 1 \\msun and it is necessary to include multiple\nstar systems in order to fit the observed luminosity function and the number of\nobserved Wolf-Rayet stars.

For the following ~ 70 days, the\n0.5-30 keV spectra, obtained by the Swift/XRT and the RXTE/PCA on an almost\ndaily basis, show a gradual hardening, with large flux variability.

To investigate the extent to which satellite and central\ngalaxy evolution differs, we separately model the stellar mass - halo mass (M*\n-Mh) relation for these two populations over the redshift interval 0 < z < 1.\nThis relation for central galaxies is constrained by the galaxy stellar mass\nfunction while the relation for satellite galaxies is constrained against\nrecent measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function (2PCF). At z ~\n0 the satellites, on average, have ~10% larger stellar masses at fixed peak\nsubhalo mass compared to central galaxies of the same halo mass. This is\nrequired in order to reproduce the observed stellar mass-dependent 2PCF and\nsatellite fractions. At low masses our model slightly under-predicts the\ncorrelation function at ~1 Mpc scales.

Constant dark matter and baryonic accelerations at a reference radius\nhave effectively been observed for a large class of different galaxies, which\nis in support of this approach. The new self similar properties implies that\nthe total acceleration at larger distances is scale free, the transition\nbetween the dark matter and baryons dominated regime occurs at a constant\nacceleration, and the maximum of the velocity curve which defines the amplitude\nof the velocity curve at larger distances is proportional to $M^{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\nThese results demonstrates that in this self similar model, cold dark matter is\nconsistent with the basics of MOND phenomenology for the galaxies.

To describe\nthe amplification of the magnetic field quantitatively we model the\nmicrophysics in the interstellar medium (ISM) of young galaxies and determine\nthe growth rate of the small-scale dynamo.

We then show that an almost flat rotation curve, combined with\nmodest velocity anisotropy, is already sufficient to recover the kinematic\nprofiles of nearby ellipticals. As an application, we provide two different\nsets of mass estimators for elliptical galaxies, based on either the velocity\ndispersion at a specific location near the effective radius, or the\naperture-averaged velocity dispersion. In the large aperture (virial) limit,\nmass estimators are naturally independent of anisotropy. The spherical mass\nenclosed within the effective radius $R_{\\rm e}$ can be estimated as $2.4\nR_{\\rm e} \\langle \\sigma^{2}_{\\rm p} \\rangle/ G$, where $\\langle \\sigma^2_{\\rm\np} \\rangle$ is the average of the squared velocity dispersion over a finite\naperture.

As a result, the slope in the\nage-metallicity relation flattens significantly at Galactic radii larger than\nsolar.

An inversion in the radial metallicity gradient is\nfound from negative to weakly positive (at r<10 kpc), and from positive to\nnegative for the [Mg/Fe] gradient, with increasing distance from the disk\nplane.

This\nrelatively high detection rate (41%) may be due to the composition of our\nsample which at a median redshift of 1.1 is dominated by the hosts of dark\nGRBs. Although the numbers are small, statistics suggest that dark GRBs are\nmore likely to be detected in the IR than their optically-bright counterparts.\nCombining our IR data with optical, near-infrared, and radio data from our own\ndatasets and from the literature, we have constructed spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) which span up to 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. By\nfitting the SEDs, we have obtained stellar masses, dust masses, star-formation\nrate (SFR), and extinctions for our sample galaxies. We find that GRBHs are\ngalaxies that tend to have a high specfic SFR (sSFR), and like other\nstar-forming galaxies, their ratios of dust-to-stellar mass are well correlated\nwith sSFR. We incorporate our Herschel sample into a larger compilation of\nGRBHs, and compare this combined sample to SFR-weighted median stellar masses\nof the widest, deepest galaxy survey to date. This is done in order to\nestablish whether or not GRBs can be used as an unbiased tracer of cosmic\ncomoving SFR density (SFRD) in the universe. In contrast with previous results,\nthis comparison shows that GRBHs are medium-sized galaxies with relatively high\nsSFRs; stellar masses and sSFRs of GRBHs as a function of redshift are similar\nto what is expected for star-forming galaxy populations at similar redshifts.\nWe conclude that there is no strong evidence that GRBs are biased tracers of\nSFRD; thus they should be able to reliably probe the SFRD to early epochs. \n\n"}

We consider\na simple, however rather realistic, mean-field galactic dynamo model where the\neffects of small-scale generation are represented by random injections of\nmagnetic field from star forming regions. We represent an encounter by the\nintroduction of large-scale streaming velocities and by an increase in\nsmall-scale magnetic field injections. The latter describes the effect of an\nincrease of the star formation rate caused by the encounter. We demonstrate\nthat large-scale streaming, with associated deviations in the rotation curve,\ncan result in an enhancement of the anisotropic turbulent (ordered) magnetic\nfield strength, mainly along the azimuthal direction, leading to a significant\ntemporary increase of the total magnetic energy during the encounter; the\nrepresentation of an increase in star formation rate has an additional strong\neffect. In contrast to expectations, the large-scale (regular) magnetic field\nstructure is not significantly destroyed by the encounter. It may be somewhat\nweakened for a relatively short period, and its direction after the encounter\nmay be reversed. The encounter causes enhanced total and polarized emission\nwithout increase of the regular magnetic field strength.

We establish a set of four observationally\nmeasurable parameters which can be used in combination, to identify a subset of\ngalaxy groups which are old, with a very high probability. We thus argue that a\nsample of fossil groups selected based on luminosity gap will result in a\ncontaminated sample of old galaxy groups. By adding constraints on the\nluminosity of the brightest galaxy, and its offset from the group luminosity\ncentroid, we can considerably improve the age-dating. \n\n"}

To investigate this\ncorrelation, we use a phenomenological model that successfully describes star\nformation rates, luminosities and stellar masses of star forming galaxies,\napplying it to GRB production. We predict luminosities, stellar masses, and\nmetallicities of host galaxies depending on the metallicity bias. Our\nbest-fitting model includes a moderate metallicity bias, broadly consistent\nwith the large majority of long-duration GRBs in metal-poor environments\noriginating from collapsars (probability ~83%), but with a secondary\ncontribution (~17%) from metal-independent production channels, such as binary\nevolution. Because of the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies, the maximum\nlikelihood model predicts that the metal-independent channel becomes dominant\nat z<2, where hosts have higher metallicities and collapsars are suppressed.\nThis possibly explains why some studies find no clear evidence of a metal-bias\nbased on low-z samples.

To perform\nthese measurements, we use CO, HCO$^+$, and DCO$^+$ millimetre line\nobservations and compare them with the predictions of radiative transfer and\nchemical models away from thermodynamical equilibrium. The CO observations\nallow us to constrain the density, temperature, and column density towards each\nobserved position, while the DCO$^+$/HCO$^+$ abundance ratios provide us with\nconstraints on the electron fraction and, consequently, on the cosmic ray\nionisation rate. Towards positions located close to the supernova remnant, we\nfind cosmic ray ionisation rates much larger ($\\gtrsim100$) than those in\nstandard galactic clouds.

In this article we also\ndescribe our open-source, neutrino interaction library NuLib (available at\nhttp://www.nulib.org). We believe that an open-source approach to describing\nthese interactions is one of the major steps needed to progress towards robust\nmodels of CCSNe and robust predictions of the neutrino signal. We show, via\ncomparisons to full Boltzmann neutrino transport simulations of CCSNe, that our\nneutrino transport code performs remarkably well. Furthermore, we show that the\nmethods and approximations we employ to increase efficiency do not decrease the\nfidelity of our results. We also test the ability of our general relativistic\ntransport code to model failed CCSN by evolving a 40 solar-mass progenitor to\nthe onset of collapse to a black hole. \n\n"}

It was also detected by H.E.S.S. at VHE\ngamma-rays, which allowed constraining the redshift of PKS 0447-439 by\nconsidering the attenuation caused by gamma-ray interactions with ambient\nphotons in the extragalactic background light (EBL). This constraint agreed\nwith color-magnitude and spectroscopic redshift constraints (0.179 < z < 0.56),\nRecently, however, a much higher redshift was proposed for this blazar (z >\n1.2). This value was debated because if true, it would imply either that the\nrelevant absorption processes of gamma-rays are not well understood or that the\nEBL is dramatically different from what is believed today. This high redshift\nwas not confirmed by three independent new spectroscopic observations at high\nsignal-to-noise ratios.\n  Given that BL-Lac are typically hosted by elliptical galaxies, which in turn\nare associated with groups, we aim to find the host group of galaxies of PKS\n0447-439. The ultimate goal is to estimate a redshift for this blazar.\n  Spectra of twenty-one objects in the field of view of PKS 0447-439 were\nobtained with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph. Based on the redshifts and\ncoordinates of these galaxies, we searched for groups of galaxies. Using a deep\ncatalog of groups, we studied the probability of finding by chance a group of\ngalaxies in the line of sight of PKS 0447-439.\n  We identified a group of galaxies that was not previously cataloged at z =\n0.343 with seven members, a virial radius of 0.42 Mpc, and a velocity\ndispersion of 622 km s^-1.

Abstract: Currently clusters/associations of stars are mainly detected as surface\ndensity enhancements relative to the background field. While clusters form,\ntheir surface density increases. It likely decreases again at the end of the\nstar formation process when the system expands as a consequence of gas\nexpulsion. Therefore the surface density of a single cluster can change\nconsiderably in young clusters/associations during the first 20 Myr of their\ndevelopment. We investigate the effect of the gas expulsion on the\ndetectability of clusters/associations typical for the solar neighborhood,\nwhere the star formation efficiency is <35%. The main focus will be laid on the\ndependence on the initial cluster mass. Nbody methods are used to determine the\ncluster/association dynamics after gas expulsion. We find that, even for low\nbackground densities, only clusters/associations with initial central surface\ndensities exceeding a few 5000 M(sun)/pc2 will be detected as clusters at ages\n~5 Myr. Even the Orion Nebula cluster, one of the most massive nearby clusters,\nwould only be categorized as a small co-moving group with current methods after\n5 Myr of development. This means that cluster expansion leads to a selection\neffect - at ages of <1-2 Myr the full range of clusters/associations is\nobserved whereas at ages > 4 Myr only the most massive clusters are identified,\nwhile systems with initially M_c < 3 000 M(sun) are missing. The temporal\ndevelopment of stellar properties is usually determined by observing clusters\nof different ages. The potentially strong inhomogeneity of the cluster sample\nmakes this methods highly questionable. However, GAIA could provide the means\nto rectify this situation as it will be able to detect lower mass clusters. \n\n"}

Here, we investigate the connection between the sizes of the\nFe core emission regions and the measured sizes of the dusty tori in 13 local\nType 1 AGN.

In a significant fraction of objects without a clear narrow line\ncore, R_fe is similar to, or smaller than the radius of the optical broad line\nregion. These facts place important constraints on the torus geometries for our\nsample.

In the\nlast stages of this process, the holes undergo an extremely loud phase of\ngravitational wave emission, possibly detectable by current and future probes.\nThe theoretical effort towards obtaining a coherent physical picture of the\nbinary path down to coalescence is still underway. In this paper, for the first\ntime, we take advantage of observational studies of active galactic nuclei\nevolution to constrain the efficiency of gas-driven binary decay. Under\nconservative assumptions we find that gas accretion toward the nuclear black\nholes can efficiently lead binaries of any mass forming at high redshift (> 2)\nto coalescence within the current time. The observed \"downsizing\" trend of the\naccreting black hole luminosity function further implies that the gas inflow is\nsufficient to drive light black holes down to coalescence, even if they bind in\nbinaries at lower redshifts, down to z~0.5 for binaries of ~10 million solar\nmasses, and z~0.2 for binaries of ~1 million solar masses.

The intergalactic medium prescription of Inoue et\nal.(2014) and galaxy synthesis models of Bruzual&Charlot (2003) have been used\nto properly treat the ultraviolet stellar emission, the stochasticity of the\nintergalactic transmission and mean free path in the ionizing regime. Color\ntracks are computed by turning on/off the escape fraction of ionizing\nradiation. At variance with recent studies, a careful treatment of IGM\ntransmission leads to no significant effects on the high-redshift broad-band\ncolor selection. The decreasing mean free path of ionizing photons with\nincreasing redshift further diminishes the contribution of the LyC to\nbroad-band colors. We also demonstrate that prominent LyC sources can be\nselected under suitable conditions by calculating the probability of a null\nescaping ionizing radiation. The method is applied to a sample of galaxies\nextracted from the GOODS-S field. A known LyC source at z=3.795 is successfully\nrecovered as a LyC emitter candidate and another convincing candidate at\nz=3.212 is reported.

The calibration sample has two parts;\nthe first part includes 18 M dwarfs with metallicities determined by\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy and the second part contains 49 dwarfs with\nmetallicities obtained through moderate-resolution spectra.

We use the Spitzer and Herschel Hi-GAL surveys to\nidentify bipolar HII regions. We search for their exciting star(s) and estimate\ntheir distances using near-IR data. Dense clumps are detected using\nHerschel-SPIRE data. MALT90 observations allow us to ascertain their\nassociation with the central HII region. We identify Class 0/I YSOs using their\nSpitzer and Herschel-PACS emissions. These methods will be applied to the\nentire sample of candidate bipolar HII regions. This paper focuses on two\nbipolar HII regions, one interesting in terms of its morphology,\nG319.88$+$00.79, and one in terms of its star formation, G010.32$-$00.15. Their\nexciting clusters are identified and their photometric distances estimated to\nbe 2.6 kpc and 1.75 kpc, respectively. We suggest that these regions formed in\ndense and flat structures that contain filaments. They have a central ionized\nregion and ionized lobes perpendicular to the parental cloud. The remains of\nthe parental cloud appear as dense (more than 10^4 per cm^3) and cold (14-17 K)\ncondensations. The dust in the PDR is warm (19-25 K). Dense massive clumps are\npresent around the central ionized region. G010.32-00.14 is especially\nremarkable because five clumps of several hundred solar masses surround the\ncentral HII region; their peak column density is a few 10^23 per cm^2, and the\nmean density in their central regions reaches several 10^5 per cm^3.

Therefore, in\norder to compare observed results with theoretical predictions it is important\nto examine the effect of the supersonic relative motion on the small-scale\nstructure formation. In this paper, we investigate this effect on the nonlinear\nstructure formation in the context of the spherical collapse model in order to\nunderstand the fundamental physics in a simple configuration. We show the\nevolution of the dark matter sphere with the relative velocity by both using\nN-body simulations and numerically calculating the equation of motion for the\ndark matter mass shell. The effects of the relative motion in the spherical\ncollapse model appear as the delay of the collapse time of dark matter halos\nand the decrease of the baryon mass fraction within the dark matter sphere.\nBased on these results, we provide the fitting formula of the critical density\ncontrast for collapses with the relative motion effect and calculate the mass\nfunction of dark matter halos in the Press-Schechter formalism. As a result,\nthe relative velocity decreases the abundance of dark matter halos whose mass\nis smaller than $10^8~M_\\odot/h$. \n\n"}

Abstract: An increasing number of so-called superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are\ndiscovered. It is believed that at least some of them with slowly fading light\ncurves originate in stellar explosions induced by the pair instability\nmechanism. Recent stellar evolution models naturally predict pair instability\nsupernovae (PISNe) from very massive stars at wide range of metallicities (up\nto Z=0.006, Yusof et al. 2013). In the scope of this study we analyse whether\nPISN models can match the observational properties of SLSNe with various light\ncurve shapes. Specifically, we explore the influence of different degrees of\nmacroscopic chemical mixing in PISN explosive products on the resulting\nobservational properties. We artificially apply mixing to the 250 Msun PISN\nevolutionary model from Kozyreva et al. (2014) and explore its supernova\nevolution with the one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. The\ngreatest success in matching SLSN observations is achieved in the case of an\nextreme macroscopic mixing, where all radioactive material is ejected into the\nhydrogen-helium outer layer. Such an extreme macroscopic redistribution of\nchemicals produces events with faster light curves with high photospheric\ntemperatures and high photospheric velocities. These properties fit a wider\nrange of SLSNe than non-mixed PISN model. Our mixed models match the light\ncurves, colour temperature and photospheric velocity evolution of two\nwell-observed SLSNe PTF12dam and LSQ12dlf. However, these models' extreme\nchemical redistribution may be hard to realise in massive PISNe. Therefore,\nalternative models such as the magnetar mechanism or wind-interaction may still\nto be favourable to interpret rapidly rising SLSNe. \n\n"}

The currently favored theoretical\ninterpretation of this relation is that the physics governing power output in\nweakly accreting black holes depends more on relative accretion rate than on\nmass. In order to test this theory, we explore whether a mass-invariant\napproach can simultaneously explain the broadband spectral energy distributions\nfrom two black holes at opposite ends of the mass scale but at similar\nEddington accretion fractions.

We estimate that the traveling speed of the\nradial migration are roughly 1.1$\\pm0.1$ kpc Gyr$^{-1}$, equivalent with about\n$1.1\\pm0.1$ km s$^{-1}$. This is in agreement with the median $v_R$ of\n$2.6^{+1.8}_{-1.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ of the \\it{narrow stripe}. We also obtain that\nabout one third stars in the solar neighborhood are radially migrated from\naround 4 kpc.

At the heart of an AGN is\na relativistic accretion disk around a spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nwith an X-ray emitting corona and, sometimes, a relativistic jet. On larger\nscales, the outer accretion disk and molecular torus act as the reservoirs of\ngas for the continuing AGN activity. And on all scales from the black hole\noutwards, powerful winds are seen that probably affect the evolution of the\nhost galaxy as well as regulate the feeding of the AGN itself. In this review\narticle, we discuss how X-ray spectroscopy can be used to study each of these\ncomponents.

A model for finite-sized, low-temperature amorphous hydrocarbon\nparticles, based on the microphysical properties of random and defected\nnetworks of carbon and hydrogen atoms, with surfaces passivated by hydrogen\natoms, has been developed.

In this paper, we\npoint to an important effect that has been ignored or considered insignificant\nwhile interpreting these new high-frequency radio data, namely the\ncontamination due to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect that changes the\nobserved synchrotron flux. Even though the radio relics reside in the cluster\noutskirts, the shock-driven pressure boost increases the SZ signal locally by\nroughly an order of magnitude. The resulting flux contamination for some\nwell-known relics are non-negligible already at 10 GHz, and at 30 GHz the\nobserved synchrotron fluxes can be diminished by a factor of several from their\ntrue values. Interferometric observations are not immune to this contamination,\nsince the change in the SZ signal occurs roughly at the same length scale as\nthe synchrotron emission, although there the flux loss is less severe than\nsingle-dish observations. We present a simple analytical approximation for the\nsynchrotron-to-SZ flux ratio, based on a theoretical radio relic model that\nconnects the non-thermal emission to the thermal gas properties, and show that\nby measuring this ratio one can potentially estimate the relic magnetic fields\nor the particle acceleration efficiency. \n\n"}

Here we present results using a so far underutilised\ndiscriminant, their stellar population properties. Based on new spectroscopy\nfrom 8-10m telescopes, we derive ages, metallicities, and [\\alpha/Fe] of 29\nCSSs. These range from GCs with sizes of merely a few parsec to compact\nellipticals larger than M32. Together with a literature compilation, this\nprovides a panoramic view of the stellar population characteristics of\nearly-type systems. We find that the CSSs are predominantly more metal rich\nthan typical galaxies at the same stellar mass. At high mass, the compact\nellipticals (cEs) depart from the mass-metallicity relation of massive\nearly-type galaxies, which forms a continuous sequence with dwarf galaxies. At\nlower mass, the metallicity distribution of ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) changes\nat a few times $10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$, which roughly coincides with the mass where\nluminosity function arguments previously suggested the GC population ends. The\nhighest metallicities in CSSs are paralleled only by those of dwarf galaxy\nnuclei and the central parts of massive early types. These findings can be\ninterpreted as CSSs previously being more massive and undergoing tidal\ninteractions to obtain their current mass and compact size. Such an\ninterpretation is supported by CSSs with direct evidence for tidal stripping,\nand by an examination of the CSS internal escape velocities. \n\n"}

We here re-analyze an\nintriguing gedanken experiment which was designed by Bekenstein to challenge\nthe GSL. In this historical gedanken experiment an entropy-bearing box is\nlowered into a charged Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole. For the GSL to work,\nthe resulting increase in the black-hole surface area (entropy) must compensate\nfor the loss of the box's entropy. We show that if the box can be lowered\nadiabatically all the way down to the black-hole horizon, as previously assumed\nin the literature, then for near-extremal black holes the resulting increase in\nblack-hole surface-area (due to the assimilation of the box by the black hole)\nmay become too small to compensate for the loss of the box's entropy. In order\nto resolve this apparent violation of the GSL, we here suggest to use a\ngeneralized version of the hoop conjecture. In particular, assuming that a\nphysical system of mass $M$ and electric charge $Q$ forms a black hole if its\ncircumference radius $r_{\\text{c}}$ is equal to (or smaller than) the\ncorresponding Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black-hole radius\n$r_{\\text{RN}}=M+\\sqrt{M^2-Q^2}$, we prove that a new (and larger) horizon is\nalready formed before the entropy-bearing box reaches the horizon of the\noriginal near-extremal black hole.

Abstract: Large dust grains can fluctuate dramatically in their local density, relative\nto gas, in neutral, turbulent disks. Small, high-redshift galaxies (before\nreionization) represent ideal environments for this process. We show via simple\narguments and simulations that order-of-magnitude fluctuations are expected in\nlocal abundances of large grains under these conditions. This can have\nimportant consequences for star formation and stellar abundances in extremely\nmetal-poor stars. Low-mass stars could form in dust-enhanced regions almost\nimmediately after some dust forms, even if the galaxy-average metallicity is\ntoo low for fragmentation to occur. The abundances of these 'promoted' stars\nmay contain interesting signatures, as the CNO abundances (concentrated in\nlarge carbonaceous grains and ices) and Mg and Si (in large silicate grains)\ncan be enhanced or fluctuate independently. Remarkably, otherwise puzzling\nabundance patterns of some metal-poor stars can be well-fit by standard\ncore-collapse SNe yields, if we allow for fluctuating dust-to-gas ratios. We\nalso show that the observed log-normal-like distribution of enhancements in\nthese species agrees with our simulations. Moreover, we confirm Mg and Si are\ncorrelated in these stars, with abundance ratios similar to those in local\nsilicate grains.

We combine stellar kinematics in the central regions with\nthe dynamics of 612 globular clusters out to 200 kpc and satellite galaxies\nextending to scales comparable with the virial radius.

We place the galaxy on four different orbits in a\nVirgo-like cluster and evolve it for 10 Gyr. As a reference case we also evolve\nthe same model in isolation. Tidally induced bars form on all orbits soon after\nthe first pericenter passage and survive until the end of the evolution.

Since the dust has been\nheated by absorbing UV and (potentially) soft X-ray photons of the flare, the\nreprocessing light curve yields an estimate of the bolometric flare luminosity.\nFor the flare PTF-09ge, we infer that the most likely value of the luminosity\nintegrated over frequencies at which dust can absorb photons is $8\\times\n10^{44}$ erg/s, with a factor of 3 uncertainty due to the unknown temperature\nof the dust.

Here we present the observations of this system at ~ 0.6\"\n(240 AU) resolution in C18O (J=2-1) and 230 GHz continuum obtained with Atacama\nLarge Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, and in SO obtained with Submillimeter\nArray. The observations show for the first time how a Keplerian rotating disk\ncan be formed inside a flattened envelope. The flattened envelope is detected\nin C18O, extending out to >~ 2400 AU from the VLA 1 source. It has a\ndifferential rotation, with the outer part (>~ 2000 AU) better described by a\nrotation that has constant specific angular momentum and the innermost part (<~\n160 AU) by a Keplerian rotation. The rotationally supported disk is therefore\nrelatively compact in this system, which is consistent with the dust continuum\nobservations.

Such a decrease is not\nexpected outside a disk formed from simple hydrodynamic core collapse, but can\nhappen naturally if the core is significantly magnetized, because magnetic\nfields can be trapped in the transition region outside the disk by the ram\npressure of the protostellar accretion flow, which can lead to efficient\nmagnetic braking.

However, the recent progress in cosmic gamma-ray studies\nchallenges these attempts.

Here we present the stellar kinematics of Dragonfly 44, one of the\nlargest Coma UDGs, using a 33.5 hr integration with DEIMOS on the Keck II\ntelescope. We find a velocity dispersion of 47 km/s, which implies a dynamical\nmass of M_dyn=0.7x10^10 M_sun within its deprojected half-light radius of\nr_1/2=4.6 kpc. The mass-to-light ratio is M/L=48 M_sun/L_sun, and the dark\nmatter fraction is 98 percent within the half-light radius. The high mass of\nDragonfly 44 is accompanied by a large globular cluster population. From deep\nGemini imaging taken in 0.4\" seeing we infer that Dragonfly 44 has 94 globular\nclusters, similar to the counts for other galaxies in this mass range. Our\nresults add to other recent evidence that many UDGs are \"failed\" galaxies, with\nthe sizes, dark matter content, and globular cluster systems of much more\nluminous objects. We estimate the total dark halo mass of Dragonfly 44 by\ncomparing the amount of dark matter within r=4.6 kpc to enclosed mass profiles\nof NFW halos. The enclosed mass suggests a total mass of ~10^12 M_sun, similar\nto the mass of the Milky Way. The existence of nearly-dark objects with this\nmass is unexpected, as galaxy formation is thought to be maximally-efficient in\nthis regime. \n\n"}

The HI cavity coincides with the thermal and non-thermal\nemitting X-ray shell. The thermal X-rays are coincident with the edge of the HI\ndistribution, which indicates a strong density gradient, while the non-thermal\nX-rays are found toward the less dense, inner part of the HI cavity. The most\nsignificant non-thermal X-rays are seen toward the southwestern part of the\nshell where the HI gas traces the dense and cold component. We also identified\nCO clouds which are likely interacting with the SNR shock waves in the same\nvelocity range as the HI, although the CO clouds are distributed only in a\nlimited part of the SNR shell. The most massive cloud is located in the\nsoutheastern part of the shell, showing detailed correspondence with the\nthermal X-rays. These CO clouds show an enhanced CO $J$ = 2-1/1-0 intensity\nratio, suggesting heating/compression by the shock front. We interpret that the\nshock-cloud interaction enhances non-thermal X-rays in the southwest and the\nthermal X-rays are emitted by the shock-heated gas of density 10-100 cm$^{-3}$.\nMoreover, we can clearly see an HI envelope around the CO cloud, suggesting\nthat the progenitor had a weaker wind than the massive progenitor of the\ncore-collapse SNR RX J1713.7$-$3949.

This has been interpreted as a hint of the reionization of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM): the emitted Ly$\\alpha$ photons would be scattered\nby an increasingly neutral IGM at $z>6$. We study this effect by modeling the\nionization and Ly$\\alpha$ radiative transfer in the infall region and the IGM\naround a Ly$\\alpha$ emitting galaxy (LAE), for a spherical halo model with the\nmean density and radial velocity profiles in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmological scenario.

Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) have recently re-emerged as attractive candidates for\nmediating feedback in galaxies because of their long cooling timescales. They\ncan have energy densities comparable to the thermal gas, but do not suffer\ncatastrophic cooling losses. Recent simulations have shown that the momentum\nand energy deposited by CRs moving with respect to the ambient medium can drive\ngalactic winds. However, simulations are hampered by our ignorance of the\ndetails of CR transport. Two key limits previously considered model CR\ntransport as a purely diffusive process (with a constant diffusion coefficient)\nand as an advective streaming process. With a series of GADGET simulations, we\ncompare and contrast the results of these different assumptions. In idealised\nthree-dimensional galaxy formation models, we show that these two cases result\nin significant differences for the galactic wind mass loss rates and star\nformation suppression in dwarf galaxies with halo masses\n$M\\approx10^{10}\\,\\textrm{M}_\\odot$: diffusive CR transport results in more\nthan ten times larger mass loss rates compared to CR streaming models. We\ndemonstrate that this is largely due to the excitation of Alfv\\'en waves during\nthe CR streaming process that drains energy from the CR population to the\nthermal gas, which is subsequently radiated away. By contrast, CR diffusion\nconserves the CR energy in the absence of adiabatic changes and if CRs are\nefficiently scattered by Alfv\\'en waves that are propagating up the CR\ngradient. Moreover, because pressure gradients are preserved by CR streaming,\nbut not diffusion, the two can have a significantly different dynamical\nevolution regardless of this energy exchange. In particular, the constant\ndiffusion coefficients usually assumed can lead to unphysically high CR fluxes. \n\n"}

Stress buildup\nand yielding in a magnetar crust is a global phenomenon: an elastic distortion\nradiating from one plastically deforming zone is shown to dramatically increase\nthe creep rate in distant zones. Runaway creep to dynamical rates is shown to\nbe possible, being enhanced by in situ heating and suppressed by thermal\nconduction and shearing of an embedded magnetic field. A global and\ntime-dependent model of elastic, plastic, magnetic, and thermal evolution is\ndeveloped. Fault-like structures develop naturally, and a range of outburst\ntimescales is observed. Transient events with time profiles similar to giant\nmagnetar flares (millisecond rise, $\\sim$ 0.1 s duration, and decaying\npower-law tails) result from runaway creep that starts in localized\nsub-km-sized patches and spreads across the crust.

It has been recently argued that\nthe post-merger ringdown waveform of exotic ultracompact objects is initially\nidentical to that of a black-hole, and that putative corrections at the horizon\nscale will appear as secondary pulses after the main burst of radiation. Here\nwe extend this analysis in three important directions: (i) we show that this\nresult applies to a large class of exotic compact objects with a photon sphere\nfor generic orbits in the test-particle limit; (ii) we investigate the\nlate-time ringdown in more detail, showing that it is universally characterized\nby a modulated and distorted train of \"echoes\" of the modes of vibration\nassociated with the photon sphere; (iii) we study for the first time\nequal-mass, head-on collisions of two ultracompact boson stars and compare\ntheir gravitational-wave signal to that produced by a pair of black-holes. If\nthe initial objects are compact enough as to mimic a binary black-hole\ncollision up to the merger, the final object exceeds the maximum mass for boson\nstars and collapses to a black-hole. This suggests that - in some\nconfigurations - the coalescence of compact boson stars might be almost\nindistinguishable from that of black-holes. On the other hand, generic\nconfigurations display peculiar signatures that can be searched for in\ngravitational-wave data as smoking guns of exotic compact objects. \n\n"}

The\nradiation from the unresolved circum-BH disc is analytically modeled\nconsidering self-shadowing effect. We show that the flow settles into a steady\nstate, where the flow structure consists of two distinct parts: (1) bipolar\nionized outflowing regions, where the gas is pushed outward by thermal gas\npressure and super-Eddington radiation pressure, and (2) an equatorial neutral\ninflowing region, where the gas falls toward the central BH without affected by\nradiation feedback. The resulting accretion rate is much higher than that in\nthe case of isotropic radiation, far exceeding the Eddington-limited rate to\nreach a value slightly lower than the Bondi one. The opening angle of the\nequatorial inflowing region is determined by the luminosity and directional\ndependence of the central radiation.

We conclude that both DMEOSs and\ncentral pressure ratios of DM to NM affect the slope of the mass-radius\nrelation of DMANSs. This is because of the interaction between DM and NM, which\nleads to gravitationally or self-bound DMANSs. We study the radius of the NM\nsphere as well as the radius of the DM halo for different DMANSs. The results\nconfirm that, in some cases, a NM sphere with a small radius is surrounded by a\nhalo of DM with a larger radius.

A comparison of simulated polarization\n  with Planck observations Abstract: The efforts for comparing dust polarization measurements with synthetic\nobservations from MHD models have previously concentrated on the scale of\nmolecular clouds. Here we extend the model comparisons to kiloparsec scales,\ntaking into account hot shocked gas generated by supernovae, and a non-uniform\ndynamo-generated magnetic field at both large and small scales down to 4 pc\nspatial resolution. Radiative transfer calculations are used to model dust\nemission and polarization on the top of MHD simulations. We compute synthetic\nmaps of column density $N_H$, polarization fraction $p$, and polarization angle\ndispersion $S$, and study their dependencies on the important properties of the\nMHD simulations. These include the large-scale magnetic field and its\norientation, the small-scale magnetic field, and supernova-driven shocks.\nSimilar filament-like structures of $S$ as seen in the Planck all-sky maps are\nvisible in our synthetic results, although the smallest scale structures are\nabsent from our maps. Supernova-driven shock fronts and $S$ do not show\nsignificant correlation. Instead, $S$ can clearly be attributed to the\ndistribution of the small-scale magnetic field. We also find that the\nlarge-scale magnetic field influences the polarization properties, such that,\nfor a given strength of magnetic fluctuation, a strong plane-of-the-sky mean\nfield weakens the observed $S$, while strengthening $p$. The anticorrelation of\n$p$ and $S$, and decreasing $p$ as a function of $N_H$ are consistent across\nall synthetic observations. The magnetic fluctuations follow an exponential\ndistribution, rather than Gaussian, characteristic of flows with intermittent\nrepetitive shocks.

To understand the interstellar cycle, which triggers\ngalaxy evolution, it is necessary to describe simultaneously the large-scale\nevolution widely induced by the feedback processes and the details of the gas\ndynamics that controls the star formation process through gravitational\ncollapse. We perform a set of three-dimensional high-resolution numerical\nsimulations of a turbulent, self-gravitating and magnetized interstellar medium\nwithin a $1\\ \\mathrm{kpc}$ stratified box with supernova feedback correlated\nwith star-forming regions. In particular, we focus on the role played by the\nmagnetic field and the feedback on the galactic vertical structure, the star\nformation rate (SFR) and the flow dynamics. For this purpose we vary their\nrespective intensities. We extract properties of the dense clouds arising from\nthe turbulent motions and compute power spectra of various quantities. Using a\ndistribution of supernovae sufficiently correlated with the dense gas, we find\nthat supernova explosions can reproduce the observed SFR, particularly if the\nmagnetic field is on the order of a few $\\mu G$. The vertical structure, which\nresults from a dynamical and an energy equilibrium is well reproduced by a\nsimple analytical model, which allows us to estimate the coupling between the\ngas and the supernovae.

No evidence for\na recent minor-merger that could result in the presence of the IMBH is\ndiscerned, but the data are compatible with a scenario in which minor mergers\nmay have occurred in the history of ESO 243-49.

It is then important to study variations of evolutionary\nchannels for merging BHs, which might instead form accreting BHs and become\nULXs. It was recently shown that massive binaries with mass ratios close to\nunity and tight orbits can undergo efficient rotational mixing and evolve\nchemically homogeneously, resulting in a compact BH binary. We study similar\nsystems by computing ~120000 detailed binary models with the MESA code covering\na wide range of initial parameters. For initial mass ratios M2/M1~0.1-0.4,\nprimaries >40Msun can evolve chemically homogeneously, remaining compact and\nforming a BH without undergoing Roche-lobe overflow. The secondary then expands\nand transfers mass to the BH, initiating a ULX phase. We predict that ~1 out of\n10^4 massive stars evolves this way, and that in the local universe 0.13 ULXs\nper Msun yr^-1 of star-formation rate are observable, with a strong preference\nfor low-metallicities. At metallicities log Z>-3, BH masses in ULXs are limited\nto 60Msun due to the occurrence of pair-instability supernovae which leave no\nremnant, resulting in an X-ray luminosity cut-off. At lower metallicities, very\nmassive stars can avoid exploding as pair-instability supernovae and instead\nform BHs with masses above 130Msun, producing a gap in the ULX luminosity\ndistribution. After the ULX phase, neutron-star-BH binaries that merge in less\nthan a Hubble time are produced with a formation rate <0.2 Gpc^-3 yr^-1.

The well-known anti-correlation of\nvariability-luminosity and the variability-Eddington ratio is present in our\ndata. Among the radio-loud sample, variability amplitude is found to be\ncorrelated with radio-loudness and radio-power suggesting jets also play an\nimportant role in the OV in radio-loud objects, in addition to the Eddington\nratio, which is the main driving factor of OV in radio-quiet sources. \n\n"}

We aim\nto quantify the properties of Type-III (anti-truncated) discs in a sample of S0\ngalaxies at 0.2<z<0.6. In this paper, we present the sample selection and\ndescribe in detail the methods to robustly trace the structure in their\noutskirts and correct for PSF effects. We have selected and classified a sample\nof 150 quiescent galaxies at 0.2<z<0.6 in the GOODS-N field. We perform a\nquantitative structural analysis of 44 S0-E/S0 galaxies. We corrected their\nsurface brightness profiles for PSF distortions and analysed the biases in the\nstructural and photometric parameters when the PSF correction is not applied.\nAdditionally, we have developed Elbow, an automatic statistical method to\ndetermine whether a possible break is significant - or not - and its type and\nmade it publicly available. We found 14 anti-truncated S0-E/S0 galaxies in the\nrange 0.2<z<0.6 (~30% of the final sample). This fraction is similar to the\nthose reported in the local Universe. In our sample, ~25% of the Type-III\nbreaks observed in PSF-uncorrected profiles are artifacts, and their profiles\nturn into a Type I after PSF correction. PSF effects also soften Type-II\nprofiles. We found that the profiles of Type-I S0 and E/S0 galaxies of our\nsample are compatible with the inner profiles of the Type-III, in contrast with\nthe outer profiles. We have obtained the first robust and reliable sample of 14\nanti-truncated S0--E/S0 galaxies beyond the local Universe, in the range\n0.2<z<0.6. PSF effects significantly affect the shape of the surface brightness\nprofiles in galaxy discs even in the case of the narrow PSF of HST/ACS images,\nso future studies on the subject should make an effort to correct them. \n\n"}

Moreover, the relative bias of two mass estimates can be constrained\nby comparing the mean gas fraction at the same (nominal) cluster mass. Our\nobservational study addresses the scatter between caustic (i.e., dynamically\nestimated) and true masses, and the relative bias of caustic and hydrostatic\nmasses.

The spectral energy distribution\nof the cocoon peaks at around 10 TeV, and then presents a cutoff that can be\nprecisely measured with H.E.S.S. owing to the extreme brightness of the source.\nElectrons radiating inverse-Compton gamma rays in the cutoff region are the\nsame responsible for the X-ray synchrotron emission at energies $> 1$ keV.\nTherefore, Vela X provides a unique test case, in which we can constrain the\ndensities and spectra of accelerated leptons in the cutoff regime, as well as\nthe magnetic field properties, with minimal modeling assumptions.

At redshift z=0.031, Gaia17biu is also the lowest redshift\nSLSN-I to date, and the absence of a larger population of SLSNe-I in dwarf\ngalaxies of similar redshift suggests that metallicity is likely less important\nto the production of SLSNe-I than previously believed. With the smallest\ndistance and highest apparent brightness for an SLSN-I, we are able to study\nGaia17biu in unprecedented detail. Its pre-peak near-ultraviolet to optical\ncolor is similar to that of Gaia16apd and among the bluest observed for an\nSLSN-I while its peak luminosity (M_g = -21 mag) is substantially lower than\nGaia16apd. Thanks to the high signal-to-noise ratios of our spectra, we\nidentify several new spectroscopic features that may help to probe the\nproperties of these enigmatic explosions. We detect polarization at the ~0.5%\nlevel that is not strongly dependent on wavelength, suggesting a modest, global\ndeparture from spherical symmetry.

This relation is insensitive to the nuclear\nequation of state (EOS) employed in this work. Combining with another universal\nrelation of the $f$-mode oscillations, we point out that the time dependent\nmass-radius relation of the PNS can be obtained by observing both the $f$- and\n$w_1$-mode GWs simultaneously.

Our simulations predict the\npresence of significant hot gas in the halos as early as $z=3-4$, well before\nthe halos ought to be able to sustain hot mode accretion in the conventional\npicture. The nascent coronae grow inside-out and initially do so primarily as a\nresult of outflows from the central galaxies powered by merger-induced shock\nheating and strong supernovae feedback, both of which are elemental features of\ntoday's successful galaxy formation models. Furthermore, the outflows and the\nforming coronae also accelerate the transition from cold to hot mode accretion\nby contributing to the conditions for sustaining stable accretion shocks. They\nalso disrupt the filamentary streams funneling cold gas onto the central\ngalaxies by causing their mouths to fray into a broad delta, detach from the\ngalaxies, and be pushed away to larger radii.

Observed variations of GMC mass functions in\ndifferent galactic environment indicates that massive GMCs preferentially\nreside along galactic spiral structures whereas inter-arm regions have many\nsmall GMCs. Based on the phase transition dynamics from magnetized warm neutral\nmedium to molecular clouds, Kobayashi et al. 2017 proposes a semi-analytical\nevolutionary description for GMC mass functions including cloud-cloud collision\n(CCC) process. Their results show that CCC is less dominant in shaping the mass\nfunction of GMCs compared with the accretion of dense HI gas driven by the\npropagation of supersonic shock waves. However, their formulation does not take\ninto account the possible enhancement of star formation by CCC.

Following galaxy merger trees from the Millennium\nsimulation, we model BH mergers with two extreme binary decay scenarios for the\n`hard binary' stage: a full or an empty loss cone. These two models should\nbracket the true evolution, and allow us to separately explore the role of\ndynamical friction and that of multi-body BH interactions on BH mergers. Using\nthe computed merger rates, we infer the stochastic gravitational wave\nbackground (GWB). Our dynamical approach is a first attempt to study the\ndynamical evolution of multiple SMBHs in the host galaxies undergoing mergers\nwith various mass ratios ($10^{-4} < q_{\\star} < 1$). Our main result\ndemonstrates that SMBH binaries are able to merge in both scenarios. In the\nempty loss cone case, we find that BHs merge via multi-body interactions,\navoiding the `final parsec' problem, and entering the PTA band with substantial\norbital eccentricity. Our full loss cone treatment, albeit more approximate,\nsuggests that the eccentricity becomes even higher when GWs become dominant,\nleading to rapid coalescences (binary lifetime $\\lesssim1 {\\rm ~Gyr}$).

Instead, cores with higher column densities tend to be\nlocated in the upper-left corner of the Larson velocity dispersion-size\ndiagram, a result predicted previously (Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2011a).

However,\ncollapsing cores appear to approach overvirial states within a free-fall time.\nThe cause of this apparent excess of kinetic energy is an underestimation of\nthe gravitational energy, due to the assumption that the gravitational energy\nis given by the energy of an isolated sphere of constant column density. This\nexcess disappears when the gravitational energy is correctly calculated from\nthe actual spatial mass distribution, where inhomogeneities, as well as the\npotential due to the mass outside of the core, also contribute to the\ngravitational energy.

Toward the central part of the HII region complex\nG49.5-0.4, we identified four C18O clumps having sizes of ~1 pc and column\ndensities of higher than 10^23 cm^-3, which are each embedded within the four\nvelocity clouds. These four clumps are distributed close to each others within\na small distance of 5 pc, showing a complementary distribution on the sky. In\nthe position-velocity diagram, these clumps are connected with each others by\nbridge features with intermediate intensities. The high intensity ratios of\n13CO (J=3-2/J=1-0) also indicates that these four clouds are associated with\nthe HII regions. We also found these features in other HII regions in W51A. The\ntimescales of the collisions are estimated to be several 0.1 Myrs as a crossing\ntime of the clouds, which are consistent with the ages of the HII regions\nmeasured from the size of the HII regions in the 21 cm continuum emissions. We\ndiscuss the cloud-cloud collision scenario and massive star formation in W51A\nby comparing with the recent observational and theoretical studies of\ncloud-cloud collision. \n\n"}

Although our RSG models are computed with the MESA code,\nour result may be applied to other stellar evolution codes, including the BEC\nand TWIN codes. We find evidence that the mixing length increases with\nincreasing metallicity for both cases where the TiO and SED temperatures of\nRSGs are used for the calibration. Together with the recent finding of a\nsimilar correlation in low-mass red giants by Tayar et al, this implies that\nthe metallicity dependence of the mixing length is a universal feature in\npost-main sequence stars of both low and high masses.

The event can be described by a\nroughly 2 months long increase of the baseline flux in the monitored energy\nbands (optical to $\\gamma$ rays) by a factor 8, and a subsequent decrease over\nanother 2 months back to pre-flare levels.

The 13CO line data\nreveal two velocity components (at velocity peaks ~88 and ~95 km/sec) in the\ndirection of the bubble.

The Herschel temperature\nmap traces all these structures in a temperature range of ~16-24 K. In the\nvelocity space of 13CO, the two molecular clouds are separated by ~7 km/sec,\nand are interconnected by a lower intensity intermediate velocity emission\n(i.e. a broad bridge feature). A possible complementary molecular pair at [87,\n88] km/sec and [95, 96] km/sec is also observed in the velocity channel maps.\nThese observational signatures are in agreement with the outcomes of\nsimulations of the cloud-cloud collision process.

Different estimates are\ndiscrepant both their underlying physical assumptions and their results. With\nseveral detections and many upper limits for the gamma-ray fluxes of nearby\nstarforming galaxies now available, estimates that rely on empirical scalings\nbetween gamma-ray and longer-wavelength luminosities have become possible and\nincreasingly popular.

All existing 3D hydrodynamical simulations predict strong global\nmixing of the burning products due to Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities, which\nis in contradiction with observations. As a first step and to study the flame\nphysics we present a set of computational magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models in\nrectangular flux tubes, resembling a small inner region of a WD.

This suggestion gained\nsupport by an analytic backward calculation of the relative MW-M31 orbit in the\nMOND modified dynamics paradigm by Zhao et al.

We note the\nfeatures induced by the encounter in the simulation and identify their possible\nreal counterparts. The simulation was set to approximately reproduce the\nobserved MW and M31 masses, effective radii, separation, relative velocity and\ndisk inclinations. We used the publicly available adaptive-mesh-refinement code\nPhantom of RAMSES. In the simulation, matter was transferred from the MW to M31\nalong a tidal tail. The encounter induced formation of several structures\nresembling the peculiarities of the Local Group. Most notably: 1) A rotating\nplanar structure formed around M31 from the transferred material. It had a size\nsimilar to the observed satellite plane and was oriented edge-on to the\nsimulated MW, just as the real one. 2) The same structure also resembled the\ntidal features observed around M31 by its size and morphology. 3) A warp in the\nMW developed with an amplitude and orientation similar to that observed. 4) A\ncloud of particles formed around the simulated MW, with the extent of the\nactual MW satellite system.

Polarized dust foregrounds Abstract: The study of polarized dust emission has become entwined with the analysis of\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. We use new Planck maps to\ncharacterize Galactic dust emission as a foreground to the CMB polarization. We\npresent Planck EE, BB, and TE power spectra of dust polarization at 353 GHz for\nsix nested sky regions covering from 24 to 71 % of the sky. We present\npower-law fits to the angular power spectra, yielding evidence for\nstatistically significant variations of the exponents over sky regions and a\ndifference between the values for the EE and BB spectra. The TE correlation and\nE/B power asymmetry extend to low multipoles that were not included in earlier\nPlanck polarization papers. We also report evidence for a positive TB dust\nsignal. Combining data from Planck and WMAP, we determine the amplitudes and\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) of polarized foregrounds, including the\ncorrelation between dust and synchrotron polarized emission, for the six sky\nregions as a function of multipole. This quantifies the challenge of the\ncomponent separation procedure required for detecting the reionization and\nrecombination peaks of primordial CMB B modes. The SED of polarized dust\nemission is fit well by a single-temperature modified blackbody emission law\nfrom 353 GHz to below 70 GHz. For a dust temperature of 19.6 K, the mean\nspectral index for dust polarization is $\\beta_{\\rm d}^{P} = 1.53\\pm0.02 $. By\nfitting multi-frequency cross-spectra, we examine the correlation of the dust\npolarization maps across frequency. We find no evidence for decorrelation. If\nthe Planck limit for the largest sky region applies to the smaller sky regions\nobserved by sub-orbital experiments, then decorrelation might not be a problem\nfor CMB experiments aiming at a primordial B-mode detection limit on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r\\simeq0.01$ at the recombination peak. \n\n"}

We study cosmic-ray driven disk winds using a\nsimplified semi-analytic model assuming streamlines follow the large-scale\ngravitational potential gradient.

Our solutions cover a wide range of footpoint gas velocity u_0,\nmagnetic-to-cosmic-ray pressure ratio, gas-to-cosmic-ray pressure ratio, and\nangular momentum. Cosmic ray streaming at the Alfv\\'en speed enables the\neffective sound speed C_eff to increase from the footpoint to a critical point\nwhere C_eff,c = u_c ~ V_H; this differs from thermal winds in which C_eff\ndecreases outward.

Classifiers require\ntraining sets to learn the underlying patterns that allow the separation among\nclasses.

Since the mass fallback rate shows a different variability depending on\nthese orbital types, we can classify tidal disruption events (TDEs) into three\nmain categories: eccentric, parabolic, and hyperbolic TDEs. Respective TDEs are\ncharacterized by two critical values of the orbital eccentricity: the lower\ncritical eccentricity is the one below which the stars on eccentric orbits\ncause the finite, intense accretion, and the higher critical eccentricity above\nwhich the stars on hyperbolic orbits cause no accretion. Moreover, we find that\nthe parabolic TDEs are divided into three subclasses: precisely parabolic,\nmarginally eccentric, and marginally hyperbolic TDEs.

Especially, the observation of GW170104\nsuggests dynamically assembled binaries favoring a distribution of misaligned\nspins. It has been argued that mergers of unassociated BHs can be engendered\nthrough a \"chance meeting\" in a multiple BH system under gas-rich environments.\nIn this paper, we consider the merger of unassociated BHs, concordant with the\nmassive BH merger events. To that end, we simulate a multiple BH system with a\npost-Newtonian $N$-body code incorporating gas accretion and general\nrelativistic effects.

In this paper, we show\nhow stars orbiting an IMBH secondary are perturbed by an SMBH primary. We find\nthat the evolution of the stellar orbits are severely affected by the primary\nSMBH due to secular effects and stars orbiting with high inclinations with\nrespect to the SMBH-IMBH orbital plane end their lives as TDEs due to\nKozai-Lidov oscillations, hence illuminating the secondary SMBH/IMBH. Above a\ncritical SMBH mass of $\\approx 1.15 \\times 10^8$ M$_{\\odot}$, no TDE can occur\nfor typical stars in an old stellar population since the Schwarzschild radius\nexceeds the tidal disruption radius.

We used an orbit integration\nscheme to find which estimate of the transverse velocity of M31 more favors the\ninteraction scenario and then tried to reproduce it in our simulations. M33 was\nmodeled as a stellar and gaseous disk embedded in a live dark-matter halo,\nwhile M31 was approximated only with a live dark halo. In the simulations the\ntwo galaxies passed each other with a pericenter distance of 37 kpc.

The CO\nobservation shows that the SNR delineated by the radio emission is projectively\ncovered by a molecular cloud (MC) complex at V$_{\\rm {LSR}}$ = $-60$ to $-54$\nkm s$^{-1}$. Both the symmetric axis of the radio emission and the trailing\nX-ray PWN appear projectively to be along a gap between two molecular gas\npatches at $-58$ to $-57$ km s$^{-1}$. Asymmetric broad profiles of $^{12}$CO\nlines peaked at $-58$ km s$^{-1}$ are found at the eastern and southwestern\nedges of the radio emission. This represents a kinematic signature consistent\nwith an SNR-MC interaction. We also find that a superbubble, $\\sim 37'$ in\nradius, appears to surround the SNR from HI 21cm (V$_{\\rm {LSR}} \\sim -61$ to\n$-68$ km s$^{-1}$), WISE mid-IR, and optical extinction data.

Here we discuss an efficient and optimal algorithm for the\ndetection of such streaks. The optimal method to detect streaks in astronomical\nimages is by cross-correlating the image with a template of a line broadened by\nthe point spread function of the system. To do so efficiently, the\ncross-correlation of the streak position and angle is performed using the Radon\ntransform, which is the integral of pixel values along all possible lines\nthrough an image. A fast version of the Radon transform exists, which we here\nextend to efficiently detect arbitrarily short lines.

One promising\nheating scenario invokes the dissipation of Alfv\\'en waves that are generated\nby streaming cosmic rays (CRs). In order to study this idea, we use\nthree-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with the AREPO code that\nfollow the evolution of jet-inflated bubbles that are filled with CRs in a\nturbulent cluster atmosphere. We find that a single injection event produces\nthe CR distribution and heating rate required for a successful CR heating\nmodel. As a bubble rises buoyantly, cluster magnetic fields drape around the\nleading interface and are amplified to strengths that balance the ram pressure.\nTogether with helical magnetic fields in the bubble, this initially confines\nthe CRs and suppresses the formation of interface instabilities. But as the\nbubble continues to rise, bubble-scale eddies significantly amplify radial\nmagnetic filaments in its wake and enable CR transport from the bubble to the\ncooling intracluster medium. By varying the jet parameters, we obtain a rich\nand diverse set of jet and bubble morphologies ranging from Fanaroff-Riley type\nI-like (FRI) to FRII-like jets. We identify jet energy as the leading order\nparameter (keeping the ambient density profiles fixed), whereas jet luminosity\nis primarily responsible for setting the Mach numbers of shocks around\nFRII-like sources.

This\napproach mitigates any incomplete understanding of local dark matter-visible\nmatter degeneracies that can affect the determination of the VDF. Comparing\nwith the oft used Standard Halo Model (SHM), which assumes an isothermal VDF,\nwe look at how the tail of the empirically determined VDF alters our\ninterpretation of the present direct detection WIMP DM cross section exclusion\nlimits. While previous studies have suggested a very large difference (of more\nthan an order of magnitude) in the bounds at low DM masses, we show that\naccounting for the detector response at low threshold energies, the difference\nis still significant although less extreme. The change in the number of signal\nevents, when using the empirically determined DM VDF in contrast to the SHM\nVDF, is most prominent for low DM masses for which the shape of the recoil\nenergy spectrum depends sensitively on the detector threshold energy as well as\ndetector response near the threshold. We demonstrate that these trends carry\nover to the respective DM exclusion limits, modulo detailed understanding of\nthe experimental backgrounds. With the unprecedented precision of astrometric\ndata in the GAIA era, use of observationally determined DM phase-space will\nbecome a critical and necessary ingredient for DM searches.

However, it remains relatively unexplored because dense\nmolecular gas tracers like HCN and HCO+ are faint in low metallicity systems.\nWe present Green Bank Telescope observations of HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) on giant\nmolecular cloud (34pc) scales in the nearby low metallicity ($12+\\log({\\rm\nO/H})=8.2$) starburst IC 10 and compare them to those in other galaxies.

The\n$I_{\\rm HCN}/I_{\\rm HCO+}$ values are within the range seen in other galaxies,\nbut are most similar to those seen in other low metallicity sources and in\nstarbursts. The detections follow the fiducial $L_{\\rm IR}$-$L_{\\rm HCN}$ and\n$L_{\\rm IR}$-$L_{\\rm HCO+}$ relationships. These trends suggest that HCN and\nHCO+ can be used to trace dense molecular gas at metallicities of 1/4\n$Z_\\odot$, to first order. The dense gas fraction is similar to that in spiral\ngalaxies, but lower than that in U/LIRGs.

Possible ejection scenarios are binary supernova ejections (BSE)\nor dynamical ejections from star clusters (DE). Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are\nextreme runaway stars that are potentially unbound from the Galaxy. Powerful\nacceleration mechanisms such as the tidal disruption of a binary system by a\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) are required to produce them. Therefore, HVSs\nare believed to originate in the Galactic center (GC), the only place known to\nhost an SMBH. The second Gaia data release (DR2) offers the opportunity of\nstudying HVSs in an unprecedented manner. We revisit some of the most\ninteresting high-velocity stars, that is, 15 stars for which proper motions\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope were obtained in the pre-Gaia era, to unravel\ntheir origin. By carrying out kinematic analyses based on revised\nspectrophotometric distances and proper motions from Gaia DR2, kinematic\nproperties were obtained that help constrain the spatial origins of these\nstars. Stars that were previously considered (un)bound remain (un)bound in\nGalactic potentials favored by Gaia DR2 astrometry.

I focus on the evolution of the apparent spin frequency, which is\ntypically associated with the motion of a specific point on the stellar surface\n(e.g., polar cap). I start from long-term evolution (on the timescale when\ninstability significantly changes the spin frequency). For this case, I reduce\nevolution equations to one differential equation and demonstrate that it can be\ndirectly derived from energy conservation law. This equation governs evolution\nrate through sequence of thermally equilibrium states and provides linear\ncoupling for the cooling power and rotation energy losses via gravitational\nwave emission. In particular, it shows that differential rotation do not affect\nlong-term spin-down. On the contrary, on the short timescales, differential\nrotation can significantly modify the apparent spin-down, if one examines a\nstrongly unstable star with very small initial amplitude of unstable mode. This\nstatement is confirmed by consideration of Newtonian non-magnetized perfect\nfluid and dissipative stellar models as well as magnetized stellar model. For\nexample, despite that widely applied evolution equations predict effective spin\nto be constant in absence of dissipation, the CFS-unstable star should be\nobserved as spinning-down. However, effects of differential rotation on\napparent spin-down are negligible for realistic models of neutron star\nrecycling, unless: (1) the neutron star is not magnetized, and (2) r-mode\namplitude is modulated faster than the shear viscosity dissipation timescale,\nbeing large enough that spin-down can be measured on modulation timescale. \n\n"}

We propose a new\nscenario in which the supersonically colliding gas flow triggers the formation\nof both the massive filament and protostars.

A recent\ntheoretical study of the shock compression in colliding molecular flows by\nInoue et al. demonstrates that the formation of filaments with hub structure is\na usual outcome of the collision, lending support for the present scenario.

Achieving an accurate model of\ninterstellar dust is therefore of great importance. Interstellar dust models\nare usually built based on observational constraints such as starlight\nextinction and polarization, but dynamical constraints such as grain rotation\nare not considered. In this paper, we show that a newly discovered effect by\nHoang et al., so-called RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD), can act as an\nimportant dynamical constraint for dust models. Using this dynamical\nconstraint, we derive the maximum size of grains that survive in the ISM for\ndifferent dust models, including contact binary, composite, silicate-core, and\namorphous carbon mantle, and compact grain model for the different radiation\nfields. We find that the different dust models have different maximum size due\nto their different tensile strengths, and the largest maximum size corresponds\nto compact grains with the highest tensile strength.

Understanding the progenitors and the\nmechanism driving SN Ic-bl explosions vs those of their SNe Ic cousins is key\nto understanding the SN-GRB relationship and jet production in massive stars.\nHere we present the largest set of host-galaxy spectra of 28 SNe Ic and 14 SN\nIc-bl, all discovered before 2013 by the same untargeted survey, namely the\nPalomar Transient Factory (PTF). We carefully measure their gas-phase\nmetallicities, stellar masses (M*s) and star-formation rates (SFRs) by taking\ninto account recent progress in the metallicity field and propagating\nuncertainties correctly. We further re-analyze the hosts of 10 literature\nSN-GRBs using the same methods and compare them to our PTF SN hosts with the\ngoal of constraining their progenitors from their local environments by\nconducting a thorough statistical comparison, including upper limits. We find\nthat the metallicities, SFRs and M*s of our PTF SN Ic-bl hosts are\nstatistically comparable to those of SN-GRBs, but significantly lower than\nthose of the PTF SNe Ic. The mass-metallicity relations as defined by the SNe\nIc-bl and SN-GRBs are not significantly different from the same relations as\ndefined by the SDSS galaxies, in contrast to claims by earlier works.

The method uses Gaussian Processes to create smooth SFHs that are\nindependent of any functional form, with a flexible number of parameters that\nis adjusted to extract the maximum possible amount of SFH information from the\nSEDs being fit. We apply the method to reconstruct the SFHs of 48,791 galaxies\nwith $H<25$ at $0.5 < z < 3.0$ across the five CANDELS fields. Using these\nSFHs, we study the evolution of galaxies as they grow more massive over cosmic\ntime. We quantify the fraction of galaxies that show multiple major episodes of\nstar formation, finding that the median time between two peaks of star\nformation is $\\sim 0.42_{-0.10}^{+0.15}t_{univ}$ Gyr, where $t_{univ}$ is the\nage of the universe at a given redshift and remains roughly constant with\nstellar mass. Correlating SFHs with morphology, we find that studying the\nmedian SFHs of galaxies at $0.5<z<1.0$ at the same mass ($10^{10}< M_* <\n10^{10.5}M_\\odot$) allows us to compare the timescales on which the SFHs\ndecline for different morphological classifications, ranging from\n$0.60^{-0.54}_{+1.54}$ Gyr for galaxies with spiral arms to\n$2.50^{-1.50}_{+2.25}$ Gyr for spheroids.

Drag forces and accretion rates dictate how these systems are\ntransformed by these interactions. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flows, in which a binary moves\nsupersonically relative to a homogeneous medium, using the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code FLASH. We simulate a range of values of the initial semi-major\naxis of the orbit relative to the gravitational focusing impact parameter of\nthe pair. When the binary separation is less than the gravitational focusing\nimpact parameter, the pair orbits within a shared bow shock. When the pair is\nwider, each object has an individual bow-shock structure.

In contrast to previous works that tie galaxy properties to halo\nconcentration and halo formation redshift, we focus on halo growth rate as a\nmeasure of assembly history.

It\nis difficult to simultaneously explain soft Seyferts stronger variability,\nsofter spectra, and weaker energy-dependence of the variability relative to\nhard Seyferts. The soft and hard band light curves diverged on the longest time\nscales probed, consistent with the fluctuation power density spectra that\nshowed relatively greater power on long time scales in the softest bands. The\nsimplest explanation is that a relatively hard, rapidly-variable component\ndominates the total X-ray spectrum and a slowly-variable soft excess is present\nin the lowest energy channels of ASCA. Although it would be natural to identify\nthe latter with an accretion disk and the former with a corona surrounding it,\na standard thin disk could not get hot enough to radiate significantly in the\nASCA band, and the observed variability time scales are much too short. The\nhard component may have a more complex shape than a pure power-law. The most\nrapid factor of 2 flares and dips occurred within ~1000 sec in Ark 564 and a\nbit more slowly in Ton S180. The speed of the luminosity changes rules out\nviscous or thermal processes and limits the size of the individual emission\nregions to <~15 Schwarzschild radii (and probably much less), that is, to\neither the inner disk or small regions in a corona. \n\n"}

Lyman alpha galaxies also provide a robust test of the\nreionization epoch that is independent of Gunn-Peterson trough observations in\nquasar spectra and is better able to distinguish line center optical depths\ntau=5 from tau=10^5.

The key results include: (1) the f(N)\ndistribution is well fit by a Gamma-function with `break' column density log\nN_g=10^21.5 and `faint-end' slope alpha=-1.8; (2) the shape of the f(N)\ndistributions do not show evolution with redshift; (3) l(X) and O_dla decrease\nby 35% and 50% during ~1Gyr between redshift z=[3.,3.5] to z=[2.2,2.5]; and (4)\nl(X) and O_dla in the lowest SDSS redshift bin (z=2.2) are consistent with the\ncurrent values. We investigate systematic errors in damped Lya analysis and\nidentify only one important effect: we measure 40 +/- 20% higher O_dla values\ntoward a subset of brighter quasars than toward a faint subset. This effect\nruns contrary to the bias associated with dust obscuration and suggests that\ngravitational lensing may be important. Comparing the results against models of\ngalaxy formation, we find all of the models significantly underpredict l(X) at\nz=3 and only SPH models with significant feedback may reproduce O_dla at high\nredshift. We argue that the Lyman limit systems contribute ~1/3 of the\nuniverse's HI atoms at all redshifts z=2 to 5 and that the f(N) distribution\nfor N(HI)<10^20 has an inflection with slope >-1. We advocate a new mass\ndensity definition -- the mass density of predominantly neutral gas O_neut --\nto be contrasted with the mass density of gas associated with HI atoms.

I discuss the sensitivity of these observables to the\nvalue and redshift history of the equation of state parameter w, emphasizing\nwhere these different observables are and are not complementary. Demonstrating\ntime-variability of w is difficult in most cases because dark energy is\ndynamically insignificant at high redshift. Time-variability in which dark\nenergy tracks the matter density at high redshift and changes to a cosmological\nconstant at low redshift is {\\it relatively} easy to detect. However, even a\nsharp transition of this sort at z_c=1 produces only percent-level differences\nin d(z) or D_1(z) over the redshift range 0.4 < z < 1.8$, relative to the\nclosest constant-w model. Estimates of D_1(z) or H(z) at higher redshift,\npotentially achievable with the Ly-alpha forest, galaxy redshift surveys, and\nthe CMB power spectrum, can add substantial leverage on such models, given\nprecise distance constraints at z < 2.

In the range of radio luminosity sampled by these objects,\nmostly FRIIs, it has been clear for some time that a population of radio\ngalaxies (`low-excitation radio galaxies') cannot easily participate in models\nthat unify narrow-line radio galaxies and broad-line objects. We show that\nlow-excitation and narrow-line radio galaxies have systematically different\nnuclear X-ray properties: while narrow-line radio galaxies universally show a\nheavily absorbed nuclear X-ray component, such a heavily absorbed component is\nrarely found in sources classed as low-excitation objects.

Abstract: We study the effect of starlight from the first stars on the ability of other\nminihaloes in their neighborhood to form additional stars. The question of what\nthe dynamical consequences were for these target minihaloes, of their exposure\nto the ionizing and dissociating starlight from the Pop III star requires a\nfull radiation-hydrodynamics calculation. Towards this end, we have performed a\nseries of detailed, 1D, radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. We have varied\nthe distance to the source (and, hence, the flux) and the mass and evolutionary\nstage of the target haloes to quantify this effect. We find: (1) trapping of\nthe I-front and its transformation from R-type to D-type, preceded by a shock\nfront; (2) photoevaporation of the ionized gas (i.e. all gas originally located\noutside the trapping radius); (3) formation of an H_2 precursor shell which\nleads the I-front, stimulated by partial photoionization; and (4) the\nshock-induced formation of H_2 in the minihalo neutral core when the shock\nspeeds up and partially ionizes the gas. The fate of the neutral core is mostly\ndetermined by the response of the core to this shock front, which leads to\nmolecular cooling and collapse that, when compared to the same halo without\nexternal radiation, is either: (a) expedited, (b) delayed, (c) unaltered, or\n(d) reversed or prevented, depending upon the flux (i.e. distance to the\nsource) and the halo mass and evolutionary stage. Roughly speaking, most haloes\nthat were destined to cool, collapse, and form stars in the absence of external\nradiation are found to do so even when exposed to the first Pop III star in\ntheir neighborhood, while those that would not have done so are still not able\nto.

{"id": "hep-ph/9910333", "contents": "Title: Review of Speculative \"Disaster Scenarios\" at RHIC Abstract: We discuss speculative disaster scenarios inspired by hypothetical new\nfundamental processes that might occur in high energy relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions. We estimate the parameters relevant to black hole production; we\nfind that they are absurdly small. We show that other accelerator and\n(especially) cosmic ray environments have already provided far more auspicious\nopportunities for transition to a new vacuum state, so that existing\nobservations provide stringent bounds. We discuss in most detail the\npossibility of producing a dangerous strangelet. We argue that four separate\nrequirements are necessary for this to occur: existence of large stable\nstrangelets, metastability of intermediate size strangelets, negative charge\nfor strangelets along the stability line, and production of intermediate size\nstrangelets in the heavy ion environment. We discuss both theoretical and\nexperimental reasons why each of these appears unlikely; in particular, we know\nof no plausible suggestion for why the third or especially the fourth might be\ntrue. Given minimal physical assumptions the continued existence of the Moon,\nin the form we know it, despite billions of years of cosmic ray exposure,\nprovides powerful empirical evidence against the possibility of dangerous\nstrangelet production. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0409124", "contents": "Title: Phases of massive gravity Abstract: We systematically study the most general Lorentz-violating graviton mass\ninvariant under three-dimensional Eucledian group using the explicitly\ncovariant language. We find that at general values of mass parameters the\nmassive graviton has six propagating degrees of freedom, and some of them are\nghosts or lead to rapid classical instabilities. However, there is a number of\ndifferent regions in the mass parameter space where massive gravity can be\ndescribed by a consistent low-energy effective theory with cutoff\n$\\sim\\sqrt{mM_{Pl}}$ free of rapid instabilities and vDVZ discontinuity. Each\nof these regions is characterized by certain fine-tuning relations between mass\nparameters, generalizing the Fierz--Pauli condition. In some cases the required\nfine-tunings are consequences of the existence of the subgroups of the\ndiffeomorphism group that are left unbroken by the graviton mass. We found two\nnew cases, when the resulting theories have a property of UV insensitivity,\ni.e. remain well behaved after inclusion of arbitrary higher dimension\noperators without assuming any fine-tunings among the coefficients of these\noperators, besides those enforced by the symmetries. These theories can be\nthought of as generalizations of the ghost condensate model with a smaller\nresidual symmetry group. We briefly discuss what kind of cosmology can one\nexpect in massive gravity and argue that the allowed values of the graviton\nmass may be quite large, affecting growth of primordial perturbations,\nstructure formation and, perhaps, enhancing the backreaction of inhomogeneities\non the expansion rate of the Universe. \n\n"}
