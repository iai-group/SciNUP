There is a shift in the chemical potential and\nin the position in energy of the Dirac point. Also, the DOS can be changed from\na linear dependence out of value zero at the Dirac point to quadratic out of a\nfinite value.

{"id": "1004.0745", "contents": "Title: Quantum Gravity from Noncommutative Spacetime Abstract: We review a novel and authentic way to quantize gravity. This novel approach\nis based on the fact that Einstein gravity can be formulated in terms of a\nsymplectic geometry rather than a Riemannian geometry in the context of\nemergent gravity. An essential step for emergent gravity is to realize the\nequivalence principle, the most important property in the theory of gravity\n(general relativity), from U(1) gauge theory on a symplectic or Poisson\nmanifold. Through the realization of the equivalence principle, which is an\nintrinsic property in symplectic geometry known as the Darboux theorem or the\nMoser lemma, one can understand how diffeomorphism symmetry arises from\nnoncommutative U(1) gauge theory; thus, gravity can emerge from the\nnoncommutative electromagnetism, which is also an interacting theory. As a\nconsequence, a background-independent quantum gravity in which the prior\nexistence of any spacetime structure is not a priori assumed but is defined by\nusing the fundamental ingredients in quantum gravity theory can be formulated.\nThis scheme for quantum gravity can be used to resolve many notorious problems\nin theoretical physics, such as the cosmological constant problem, to\nunderstand the nature of dark energy, and to explain why gravity is so weak\ncompared to other forces. In particular, it leads to a remarkable picture of\nwhat matter is. A matter field, such as leptons and quarks, simply arises as a\nstable localized geometry, which is a topological object in the defining\nalgebra (noncommutative $\\star$-algebra) of quantum gravity. \n\n"}

The potential sources\na dynamical attractor solution with Ekpyrotic contraction which washes out\nsmall amplitude anisotropies. At high energy densities the field evolves into a\nghost condensate, leading to a nonsingular bounce. Following the bounce there\nis a smooth transition to standard expanding radiation and matter dominated\nphases. Using linear cosmological perturbation theory we track each Fourier\nmode of the curvature fluctuation throughout the entire cosmic evolution. Using\nstandard matching conditions for nonsingular bouncing cosmologies we verify\nthat the spectral index does not change during the bounce. We show there is a\ncontrolled period of exponential growth of the fluctuation amplitude for the\nperturbations (but not for gravitational waves) around the bounce point which\ndoes not invalidate the perturbative treatment. This growth induces a natural\nsuppression mechanism for the tensor to scalar ratio of fluctuations. Moreover,\nwe study the generation of the primordial power spectrum of curvature\nfluctuations for various types of initial conditions. For the pure vacuum\ninitial condition, on scales which exit the Hubble radius in the phase of\nEkpyrotic contraction, the spectrum is deeply blue. For thermal particle\ninitial condition, one possibility for generating a scale-invariant spectrum\nmakes use of a special value of the background equation of state during the\ncontracting Ekpyrotic phase.

Much of our focus\nis on the simple example of a free massive Dirac fermion, the so-called Chern\ninsulator, especially in 2+1 dimensions. In such cases, when parity and\ntime-reversal symmetry are broken, it is necessary to consider the\ngravitational sources to include a frame and an independent spin connection\nwith torsion. In 2+1 dimensions, the simplest parity-odd response is the Hall\nviscosity. We compute the Hall viscosity of the Chern insulator using a careful\nregularization scheme, and find that although the Hall viscosity is generally\ndivergent, the difference in Hall viscosities of distinct topological phases is\nwell-defined and determined by the mass gap.

First, the cascading effect has been simulated on three\nwell known networks: the IEEE 300 bus test system, the IEEE 118 bus test\nsystem, and the WSCC 179 bus equivalent model. To extend the analysis to a\nlarger set of networks, we develop a network generator and generate multiple\ngraphs with characteristics similar to the IEEE test networks but with\ndifferent topologies. The generated graphs are then compared to the test\nnetworks to show the effect of topology in determining their robustness with\nrespect to cascading failures. The generated graphs turn out to be more robust\nthan the test graphs, showing the importance of topology in the robust design\nof power grids.

Nature 498, 209 (2013)], we\npresent here a detailed theoretical analysis of the Joule heating in\ncurrent-carrying single-molecule junctions. By combining the Landauer approach\nfor quantum transport with ab initio calculations, we show how the heating in\nthe electrodes of a molecular junction is determined by its electronic\nstructure. In particular, we show that in general the heat is not equally\ndissipated in both electrodes of the junction and it depends on the bias\npolarity (or equivalently on the current direction). These heating asymmetries\nare intimately related to the thermopower of the junction as both these\nquantities are governed by very similar principles.

I.e., can we \"back-propagate\"\nthrough these stochastic neurons? We examine this question, existing\napproaches, and compare four families of solutions, applicable in different\nsettings. One of them is the minimum variance unbiased gradient estimator for\nstochatic binary neurons (a special case of the REINFORCE algorithm). A second\napproach, introduced here, decomposes the operation of a binary stochastic\nneuron into a stochastic binary part and a smooth differentiable part, which\napproximates the expected effect of the pure stochatic binary neuron to first\norder. A third approach involves the injection of additive or multiplicative\nnoise in a computational graph that is otherwise differentiable. A fourth\napproach heuristically copies the gradient with respect to the stochastic\noutput directly as an estimator of the gradient with respect to the sigmoid\nargument (we call this the straight-through estimator).

In this work, opinion dynamics are examined when agents\nare Bayesian decision makers that perform hypothesis testing or signal\ndetection, and the dynamics are applied to prior probabilities of hypotheses.\nBounded confidence is defined on prior probabilities through Bayes risk error\ndivergence, the appropriate measure between priors in hypothesis testing.

Here we take into account the effect of multiple interacting\nwaves by using an agent-based model in which the interaction between\ninformation waves is based on their novelty. We analyzed the global effects of\nsuch interactions and found that information that actually reaches nodes\nreaches them faster. This effect is caused by selection between information\nwaves: slow waves die out and only fast waves survive. As a result, and in\ncontrast to models with non-interacting information dynamics, the access to\ninformation decays with the distance from the source. Moreover, when we\nanalyzed the model on various synthetic and real spatial road networks, we\nfound that the decay rate also depends on the path redundancy and the effective\ndimension of the system.

While these observations are\nconsistent with inflationary predictions, bouncing cosmologies aspire to\nprovide an alternative framework to explain them. Such models face many\nproblems, both of the purely theoretical kind, such as the necessity of\nviolating the NEC and instabilities, and at the cosmological application level,\nas exemplified by the possible presence of shear. We provide a pedagogical\nintroduction to these problems and also assess the fitness of different\nproposals with respect to the data.

If\ndark matter populates the interior of stars, and this matter is supersymmetric\nor of some other type, some of it possessing a tiny electric charge, there is\nthe possibility that highly compact stars can trap a small but non-negligible\nelectric charge. In this case the radius to mass relation for such compact\nstars should get modifications. We use an analytical scheme to investigate the\nlimiting radius to mass relation and the maximum mass of relativistic stars\nmade of an incompressible fluid with a small electric charge. The investigation\nis carried out by using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation, i.e., the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, together with the other equations of\nstructure, with the further hypothesis that the charge distribution is\nproportional to the energy density.

Using\ngroup-theoretical methods, we derive an invariant expansion of the Hamiltonian\nfor electron states near the K point of the Brillouin zone. In contrast to\nknown materials, including single-layer graphene, any possible coupling of\nphysical quantities to components of the external electric (magnetic) field has\na counterpart where the analogous component of the magnetic (electric) field\ncouples to exactly the same combination of quantities. For example, a purely\nelectric spin splitting appears as the magneto-electric analogue of the\nfamiliar magnetic Zeeman spin splitting. The measurable thermodynamic response\ninduced by magnetic and electric fields is thus completely symmetric. The Pauli\nmagnetization induced by a magnetic field takes exactly the same functional\nform as the polarization induced by an electric field. Our findings thus reveal\nunconventional behavior of spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom in their\ncoupling to external fields. We explain how these counterintuitive couplings\nare consistent with fundamental principles such as time reversal symmetry. For\nexample, only a magnetic field can give rise to a macroscopic spin\npolarization, whereas only a perpendicular electric field can induce a\nmacroscopic polarization of the sublattice-related pseudospin degree of freedom\ncharacterizing the intravalley orbital motion in bilayer graphene. These rules\nenforced by symmetry for the matter-field interactions clarify the nature of\nspins versus pseudospins. We also provide numerical values of prefactors for\nrelevant coupling terms.

For all the cases\nconsidered, the results are compatible with a dimensional reduction of the\nspacetime to $d+1=2$, at high energies (ultraviolet limit), which is confirmed\nby other quantum gravity approaches, as well as to $d+1=4$, at low energies\n(infrared limit). This is obtained by computing the free energy of massless\nscalar and gauge fields. We find that the only effect of the background is to\nchange the proportionality constant between the internal energy and\ntemperature. Firstly, we consider both the non-perturbative and perturbative\nmodels involving the matter action, without gravitational sources but with\nmanifest time and space symmetry breaking, in order to calculate modifications\nin the Stephan-Boltzmann law.

Expansion phase starts\nwhen a story is published and the article spreads from a source node to nodes\nwithin a connected component of the social network.

Scenarios covered include a narrow resonance and, as\npreliminary indications suggest, a wider resonance. If the width indications\npersist, the new particle is likely to belong to a strongly-interacting sector.\nWe also show how compatibility between Run 1 and Run 2 data is improved by\npostulating the existence of an additional heavy particle, whose decays are\npossibly related to dark matter. \n\n"}

We also show that\nsimilar ambiguities appear in the contribution from a codimension-two surface\nat which a null segment is joined to another (spacelike, timelike, or null)\nsegment. The parametrization ambiguity can be tamed by insisting that the null\ngenerators be affinely parametrized; this forces each null contribution to the\nboundary action to vanish, but leaves intact the fredom to rescale the affine\nparameter by a constant factor on each generator.

Specifically, VaDE models the data generative procedure\nwith a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a deep neural network (DNN): 1) the GMM\npicks a cluster; 2) from which a latent embedding is generated; 3) then the DNN\ndecodes the latent embedding into observables. Inference in VaDE is done in a\nvariational way: a different DNN is used to encode observables to latent\nembeddings, so that the evidence lower bound (ELBO) can be optimized using\nStochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) estimator and the\nreparameterization trick.

Moreover, by VaDE's generative nature, we show its\ncapability of generating highly realistic samples for any specified cluster,\nwithout using supervised information during training.

Each class can be topologically nontrivial if Andreev bound states are\nformed at the edges of the superconductor. Non-magnetic impurities in the\nsuperconductor affect the formation of Andreev bound states and can drastically\nchange the tunneling spectra for small voltages. Here, we investigate the mean\ncurrent and its fluctuations for two-dimensional tunnel junctions between a\nnormal-metal and unconventional superconductors by solving the quasi-classical\nEilenberger equation self-consistently, including the presence of non-magnetic\nimpurities in the superconductor. As the impurity strength increases, we find\nthat superconductivity is suppressed for almost all order parameters since (i)\nat zero applied bias, the effective transferred charge calculated from the\nnoise-current ratio tends to the electron charge $e$ and (ii) for finite bias,\nthe current-voltage characteristics follows that of a normal state junction.\nThere are notable exceptions to this trend. First, gapful nontrivial (chiral)\nsuperconductors are very robust against impurity scattering due to the linear\ndispersion relation of their surface Andreev bound states. Second, for nodal\nnontrivial superconductors, only p_x-wave pairing is almost immune to the\npresence of impurities due to the emergence of odd-frequency s-wave Cooper\npairs near the interface. Owing to their anisotropic dependence on the wave\nvector, impurity scattering is an effective pair breaking mechanism for the\nrest of nodal superconductors.

A\nremarkable consequence is the emergence of new quasiparticles with fractional\ncharge and exotic quantum statistics of which the most exciting ones are\nnon-Abelian quasiparticles. A non-integer quantized thermal Hall conductance\n$\\kappa_{xy}$ (in units of temperature times the universal constant $\\pi^2\nk_B^2 /3 h$; $h$ is the Planck constant and $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant)\nnecessitates the existence of such quasiparticles. It has been predicted, and\nverified numerically, that such states are realized in the clean half-filled\nfirst Landau level of electrons with Coulomb repulsion, with $\\kappa_{xy}$\nbeing either $3/2$ or $7/2$.

It has been predicted that DPTs can be\nprecisely identified by the discontinuities of the Pancharatnam geometric phase\n(PGP) during the time evolution. However, PGP always mixes with dynamical phase\nand the experimental observation of DPTs by PGP is still absent. Here, we\ntheoretically present a novel scheme for eliminating the dynamical phase by\ntaking advantage of chiral symmetry in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model,\nand experimentally observe DPTs by directly measuring PGP in a quenched\ntopological nanomechanical lattice. Time-dependent topological structures of\nthe SSH model are configured by eight strong-coupled high-quality-factor\nnanomechanical oscillators.

One is the selection of few influencers for\nmanipulating their actions in order to drive the whole network to a certain\nbehavior; the other, instead, drives the network behavior acting on the state\nof a large subset of ordinary, scarcely influencing users.

The response of the 2DEG\nto the hole changes abruptly at $d$ of the order of the magnetic length\n$\\lambda$.

Abstract: Current understanding of spin injection tells us that a metal ferromagnet can\ninject spin into a semiconductor with 100% efficiency if either the ferromagnet\nis an ideal half metal with 100% spin polarization, or there exists a suitable\ntunnel barrier at the interface. In this paper, we show that, at absolute zero\ntemperature, 100% spin injection efficiency from a non-ideal metal ferromagnet\ninto a semiconductor quantum wire can be reached at certain injection energies,\nwithout a tunnel barrier, provided there is an axial magnetic field along the\ndirection of current flow as well as a spin orbit interaction in the\nsemiconductor. At these injection energies, spin is injected only from the\nmajority spin band of the ferromagnetic contact, resulting in 100% spin\ninjection efficiency. This happens because of the presence of antiresonances in\nthe transmission coefficient of the minority spins when their incident energies\ncoincide with Zeeman energy states in the quantum wire.\n  At absolute zero and below a critical value of the axial magnetic field,\nthere are two distinct Zeeman energy states and therefore two injection\nenergies at which ideal spin filtering is possible; above the critical magnetic\nfield there is only one such injection energy. The spin injection efficiency\nrapidly decreases as the temperature increases. The rate of decrease is slower\nwhen the magnetic field is above the critical value. The appropriate choice of\nsemiconductor materials and structures necessary to maintain a large spin\ninjection efficiency at elevated temperatures is discussed. \n\n"}

Optimal control theory is used to select control fields\nwhich allow accelerated or decelerated system relaxation, or suppression of\nrelaxation (dissipation) altogether, depending on the dynamics we impose on the\nquantum system.

The\nfield-theoretical formulation of general relativity helped us to identify the\nphenomenological seeds of such modifications.

By\nstarting with a nonrelativistic free theory we obtain its minimal gauge\ninvariant extension by introducing two gauge fields with a Maxwellian self\ninteraction. We fix the gauge so that the residual symmetry group is the\nGalilei group and construct a representation of the extended Galilei algebra.\nThe reduced N-particle Lagrangian describes geodesic motion in a\n(N-1)-dimensional (Pseudo-) Riemannian space. The singularity of the metric for\nnegative gauge coupling leads in classical dynamics to the formation of\ngeometric bags in the case of two or three particles. The ordering problem\nwithin the quantization scheme for $N$-particles is solved by canonical\nquantization of a pseudoclassical Schroedinger theory obtained by adding to the\ncontinuum generalization of the point-particle Lagrangian an appropriate\nquantum correction. We solve the two-particle bound state problem for both\nsigns of the gauge coupling. At the end we speculate on the possible physical\nrelevance of the new interaction induced by the gauge fields. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/9912259", "contents": "Title: Charged Rotating Black Hole in Three Spacetime Dimensions Abstract: The generalization of the black hole in three-dimensional spacetime to\ninclude an electric charge Q in addition to the mass M and the angular momentum\nJ is given. The field equations are first solved explicitly when Q is small and\nthe general form of the field at large distances is established. The total\n``hairs'' M, J and Q are exhibited as boundary terms at infinity. It is found\nthat the inner horizon of the rotating uncharged black hole is unstable under\nthe addition of a small electric charge. Next it is shown that when Q=0 the\nspinning black hole may be obtained from the one with J=0 by a Lorentz boost in\nthe $\\phi -t$ plane. This boost is an ``illegitimate coordinate\ntransformation'' because it changes the physical parameters of the solution.\nThe extreme black hole appears as the analog of a particle moving with the\nspeed of light. The same boost may be used when $Q\\neq 0$ to generate a\nsolution with angular momentum from that with J=0, although the geometrical\nmeaning of the transformation is much less transparent since in the charged\ncase the black holes are not obtained by identifying points in anti-de Sitter\nspace. The metric is given explicitly in terms of three parameters,\n$\\widetilde{M}$, $ \\widetilde{Q}$ and $\\omega $ which are the ``rest mass'' and\n``rest charge'' and the angular velocity of the boost. These parameters are\nrelated to M, J and Q through the solution of an algebraic cubic equation.\nAltogether, even without angular momentum, the electrically charged 2+1 black\nhole is somewhat pathological since (i) it exists for arbitrarily negative\nvalues of the mass, and (ii) there is no upper bound on the electric charge. \n\n"}

The analysis is performed in the\nframework of nonlinear electrodynamics and we show that many features of the\nsituation can be extracted solely on the basis of symmetry considerations.\nAlthough birefringence is common in nonlinear electrodynamics it is not\nuniversal; in particular we verify that the Casimir vacuum is not birefringent\nat any incidence angle. On the other hand, group velocity is typically not\nequal to phase velocity, though the distinction vanishes for special directions\nor if one is only working to second order in the fine structure constant. We\nobtain an ``effective metric'' that is subtly different from previous results.\nThe disagreement is due to the way that ``polarization sums'' are implemented\nin the extant literature, and we demonstrate that a fully consistent\npolarization sum must be implemented via a bootstrap procedure using the\neffective metric one is attempting to define. Furthermore, in the case of\nbirefringence, we show that the polarization sum technique is intrinsically an\napproximation. \n\n"}
