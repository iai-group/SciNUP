As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies).

Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

Recent simulations and observations\nare converging on the view that the extreme luminosity of quasars is fueled in\nmajor mergers of gas-rich galaxies. In such a picture, quasars are expected to\nbe located in regions with a higher density of galaxies on small scales where\nmergers are more likely to take place. However, in this picture, the activity\nobserved in low-luminosity AGN is due to secular processes that are less\ndependent on the local galaxy density. To test this hypothesis, we compare the\nlocal photometric galaxy density on kiloparsec scales around spectroscopic Type\nI and Type II quasars to the local density around lower luminosity\nspectroscopic Type I and Type II AGN. To minimize projection effects and\nevolution in the photometric galaxy sample we use to characterize AGN\nenvironments, we place our random control sample at the same redshift as our\nAGN and impose a narrow redshift window around both the AGN and control\ntargets. We find that higher luminosity AGN have more overdense environments\ncompared to lower luminosity AGN on all scales out to our $2\\Mpchseventy$\nlimit.

In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that\nthe gravitational field produced by the disc itself (the disc's self-gravity)\nis an important ingredient in the models, especially in the context of\nprotostellar discs and of AGN discs.

The planet reaches its maximum flux at an\norbital phase of 0.396 +/- 0.022, corresponding to a hot region shifted 20-30\ndegrees east of the substellar point. Because tidally locked hot Jupiters would\nhave enormous day-night temperature differences in the absence of winds, the\nsmall amplitude of the observed phase variation indicates that the planet's\natmosphere efficiently transports thermal energy from the day side to the night\nside at the 24 micron photosphere, leading to modest day-night temperature\ndifferences.

The main new element of this study is that we used\nfully three dimensional (3-D) numerical simulations. We consider hydrodynamics\nof inviscid accretion flows. We assume a spherically symmetric density\ndistribution at the outer boundary, but brake the flow symmetry by introducing\na small, latitude-dependent angular momentum. We also consider cases where\nangular momentum at large radii is latitude- and azimuth-dependent. For the\nlatitude-dependent angular momentum, 3-D simulations confirm axisymmetric\nresults: the material that has too much angular momentum to be accreted forms a\nthick torus near the equator. Consequently, accretion proceeds only through the\npolar funnel, and the mass accretion rate through the funnel is constrained by\nthe size and shape of the torus, not by the outer conditions. In 3-D\nsimulations, we found that the torus precesses, even for axisymmetric\nconditions at large radii. For the latitude and azimuth-dependent angular\nmomentum, the non-rotating gas near the equator can also significantly affect\nthe evolution of the rotating gas.

We consider the expected\nsignal generated by an ensemble of spots randomly created on the accretion disc\nsurface. Spot generation is governed by Poisson or by Hawkes processes. We\ninclude general relativity effects shaping the signal on its propagation to a\ndistant observer. We analyse the PSD of a spotted disc light curve and show the\naccuracy of our semi-analytical approach by comparing the obtained PSD with the\nresults of Monte Carlo simulations. The asymptotic slopes of PSD are 0 at low\nfrequencies and they drop to -2 at high frequencies, usually with a single\nfrequency break. More complex two-peak solutions also occur. The amplitude of\nthe peaks and their frequency difference depend on the inherent timescales of\nthe model. At intermediate frequencies, the intrinsic PSD is influenced by the\nindividual light curve profile as well as by the type of the underlying\nprocess. However, even in cases when two Lorentzians seem to dominate the PSD,\nit does not necessarily imply that two single oscillation mechanisms operate\nsimultaneously. Instead, it may well be the manifestation of the avalanche\nmechanism. The main advantage of our approach is an insight in the model\nfunctioning and the fast evaluation of the PSD. \n\n"}

A weak-lensing signal is detected at high statistical significance\nin each cluster, the total detection S/N ranging from 5 to 13. In this paper we\nconcentrate on fitting spherical models to the tangential distortion profiles\nof the clusters. When the models are fitted to the clusters individually, we\nare unable to discriminate statistically between SIS and NFW models. However\nwhen the tangential distortion profiles of the individual clusters are\ncombined, and models fitted to the stacked profile, the SIS model is rejected\nat 6- and 11-sigma, respectively, for low- and high-mass bins. We also use the\nindividual cluster NFW model fits to investigate the relationship between\ncluster mass (M_vir) and concentration (c_vir), finding an anti-correlation of\nc_vir and M_vir.

The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD) may\nlead to the formation of a protoneutron star and a collapse-driven supernova\nexplosion. This process represents a path alternative to thermonuclear\ndisruption of accreting white dwarfs in Type Ia supernovae. Neutrino and\ngravitational-wave (GW) observations may provide crucial information necessary\nto reveal a potential AIC. Motivated by the need for systematic predictions of\nthe GW signature of AIC, we present results from an extensive set of\ngeneral-relativistic AIC simulations using a microphysical finite-temperature\nequation of state and an approximate treatment of deleptonization during\ncollapse. Investigating a set of 114 progenitor models in rotational\nequilibrium, with a wide range of rotational configurations, temperatures and\ncentral densities, we extend previous Newtonian studies and find that the GW\nsignal has a generic shape akin to what is known as a \"Type III\" signal in the\nliterature.

We investigate possible explanations that could\naccount for the observed swept back, asymmetric morphology. Previous work has\nsuggested that HD 61005 may be interacting with a cold, unusually dense\ninterstellar cloud. However, limits on the intervening interstellar gas column\ndensity from an optical spectrum of HD 61005 in the Na I D lines render this\npossibility unlikely. Instead, HD 61005 may be embedded in a more typical warm,\nlow-density cloud that introduces secular perturbations to dust grain orbits.\nThis mechanism can significantly distort the ensemble disk structure within a\ntypical cloud crossing time.

We detect\nX-ray emission even in the outskirts of clusters, beyond r_200 for richness\nclasses with X-ray temperatures above 1 keV. This enables us to more accurately\ndetermine the total gas mass in these groups and clusters. We find that the\noptically selected groups and clusters have flatter temperature profiles and\nhigher stellar-to-gas mass ratios than the individually studied, X-ray bright\nclusters. We also find that the stellar mass in poor groups with temperatures\nbelow 1 keV is comparable to the gas mass in these systems. Combining these\nresults with individual measurements for clusters, groups, and galaxies from\nthe literature, we find a break in the baryon fraction at ~1 keV. Above this\ntemperature, the baryon fraction scales with temperature as f_b \\propto\nT^0.20\\pm0.03. We see significantly smaller baryon fractions below this\ntemperature, and the baryon fraction of poor groups joins smoothly onto that of\nsystems with still shallower potential wells such as normal and dwarf galaxies\nwhere the baryon fraction scales with the inferred velocity dispersion as f_b\n\\propto \\sigma^1.6. The small scatter in the baryon fraction at any given\npotential well depth favors a universal baryon loss mechanism and a preheating\nmodel for the baryon loss. The scatter is, however, larger for less massive\nsystems. Finally, we note that although the broken power-law relation can be\ninferred from data points in the literature alone, the consistency between the\nbaryon fractions for poor groups and massive galaxies inspires us to fit the\ntwo categories of objects (galaxies and clusters) with one relation. \n\n"}

It relies on using\nsimultaneous observations of BL Lac objects in the optical, X-ray, high-energy\n(HE: E>100 MeV) gamma-ray (from the Fermi telescope), and VHE gamma-ray (from\nCherenkov telescopes) bands. For each source, the method involves best-fitting\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED) from optical through HE gamma-rays (the\nlatter being largely unaffected by EBL attenuation as long as z<1) with a\nSynchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) model. We extrapolate such best-fitting models\ninto the VHE regime, and assume they represent the BL Lacs' intrinsic emission.\nContrasting measured versus intrinsic emission leads to a determination of the\nphoton-photon opacity to VHE photons. Using, for each given source, different\nstates of emission will only improve the accuracy of the proposed method. We\ndemonstrate this method using recent simultaneous multi-frequency observations\nof the high-frequency-peaked BL Lac object PKS 2155-304 and discuss how similar\nobservations can more accurately probe the EBL. \n\n"}

We find that the L_X-L_K relationship is steeper for\nfield galaxies than for comparable galaxies in groups and clusters. The low hot\ngas content of field galaxies with L_K < L_star suggests that internal\nprocesses such as supernovae driven winds or AGN feedback expel hot gas from\nlow mass galaxies. Such mechanisms may be less effective in groups and clusters\nwhere the presence of an intragroup or intracluster medium can confine\noutflowing material. In addition, galaxies in groups and clusters may be able\nto accrete gas from the ambient medium. While there is a population of L_K <\nL_star galaxies in groups and clusters that retain hot gas halos, some galaxies\nin these rich environments, including brighter galaxies, are largely devoid of\nhot gas. In these cases, the hot gas halos have likely been removed via ram\npressure stripping. This suggests a very complex interplay between the\nintragroup/intracluster medium and hot gas halos of galaxies in rich\nenvironments with the ambient medium helping to confine or even enhance the\nhalos in some cases and acting to remove gas in others. In contrast, the hot\ngas content of more isolated galaxies is largely a function of the mass of the\ngalaxy, with more massive galaxies able to maintain their halos, while in lower\nmass systems the hot gas escapes in outflowing winds. \n\n"}

We find numerical solutions\nfor mass ratios q between 1e-3 and 1, starting at a small angular velocity for\nwhich tidal and rotational deformations are small, and following a sequence of\nincreasing angular velocities. Each series terminates at an appropriate ``Roche\nlimit'', above which no equilibrium solution can be found. Even though the\nRoche limit is crossed before the ``Roche lobe'' is filled, any further\nincrease in the angular velocity will result in mass-loss. For close,\ncomparable-mass binaries, we find that local deviations from ellipsoidal forms\nmay be as large as 10-20%, and departures from Keplerian rotation are\nsignificant. We compute the light curves that arise from our equilibrium\nconfigurations, assuming their distance is >>1 AU (e.g. in the Kuiper Belt).

Objects that are somewhat in between globular clusters and\nlow-mass galaxies, such as ultra-compact dwarf galaxies, have a mass-radius\nrelation consistent with the extension of the relation for bright ellipticals.\nHere we show that at an age of 10 Gyr a break in the mass-radius relation at\n~10^6 Msun is established because objects below this mass, i.e. globular\nclusters, have undergone expansion driven by stellar evolution and hard\nbinaries. From numerical simulations we find that the combined energy\nproduction of these two effects in the core comes into balance with the flux of\nenergy that is conducted across the half-mass radius by relaxation. An\nimportant property of this `balanced' evolution is that the cluster half-mass\nradius is independent of its initial value and is a function of the number of\nbound stars and the age only. It is therefore not possible to infer the initial\nmass-radius relation of globular clusters and we can only conclude that the\npresent day properties are consistent with the hypothesis that all hot stellar\nsystems formed with the same mass-radius relation and that globular clusters\nhave moved away from this relation because of a Hubble time of stellar and\ndynamical evolution. \n\n"}

We suggest that synchrotron\nemission of 10 - 100 TeV electrons and positrons (e+/-) can contribute to this\nemission, because starbursts have strong magnetic fields. We consider three\nsources of e+/- at these energies: (1) primary electrons directly accelerated\nby supernova remnants; (2) pionic secondary e+/- created by inelastic\ncollisions between CR protons and gas nuclei in the dense ISMs of starbursts;\n(3) pair e+/- produced between the interactions between 10 - 100 TeV gamma-rays\nand the intense far-infrared (FIR) radiation fields of starbursts. We create\none-zone steady-state models of the CR population in the Galactic Center (R <=\n112 pc), NGC 253, M82, and Arp 220's nuclei, assuming a power law injection\nspectrum for electrons and protons. We compare these models to extant radio and\nGeV and TeV gamma-ray data for these starbursts, and calculate the diffuse\nsynchrotron X-ray and Inverse Compton (IC) luminosities of these starbursts. If\nthe primary electron spectrum extends to ~PeV energies and has a\nproton/electron injection ratio similar to the Galactic value, we find that\nsynchrotron contributes 2 - 20% of their unresolved, diffuse hard X-ray\nemission. Inverse Compton emission is likewise a minority of the unresolved\nX-ray emission in these starbursts, from 0.1% in the Galactic Center to 10% in\nArp 220's nuclei. We also model generic starbursts, including submillimeter\ngalaxies, in the context of the FIR--X-ray relation, finding that up to 2% in\nthe densest starbursts with our fiducial assumptions.

Magnetic fields are thought to play a leading role in this,\nboth by determining the location of the inner edge of the disc and by exerting\nan additional torque on the star (as a result of the interaction between the\nstellar magnetic field and the disc plasma motion, which creates a toroidal\ncomponent B_phi). In some well-known analytic models, developed in the 1980s,\nthe B_phi profile was taken to be proportional to the relative angular velocity\nbetween the disc plasma and the neutron star, multiplied by a vertical dipolar\nfield. The present work stands in the line of improving those models,\nsuggesting a new profile for B.

This signature of cosmological accretion should be observable\nusing background-object absorption line studies as features that are offset\nfrom the galaxy's systemic velocity by ~100 km/s. Accreted gas typically\nco-rotates with the central disk in the form of a warped, extended cold flow\ndisk, such that the observed velocity offset is in the same direction as galaxy\nrotation, appearing in sight lines that avoid the galactic poles. This\nprediction provides a means to observationally distinguish accreted gas from\noutflow gas: the accreted gas will show large one-sided velocity offsets in\nabsorption line studies while radial/bi-conical outflows will not (except\npossibly in special polar projections).

However, the combination of 2MASS near-infrared (NIR) and\nSpitzer-IRAC mid-infrared (MIR) photometry enables a powerful method for\ndetermining the line of sight reddening to any star: the sampled wavelengths\nlie in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spectral energy distribution of most\nstars, where, to first order, all stars have essentially the same intrinsic\ncolor. Thus, changes in stellar NIR-MIR colors due to interstellar reddening\nare readily apparent, and (under an assumed extinction law) the observed colors\nand magnitudes of stars can be easily and accurately restored to their\nintrinsic values, greatly increasing their usefulness for Galactic structure\nstudies. In this paper we explore this \"Rayleigh-Jeans Color Excess\" (RJCE)\nmethod and demonstrate that use of even a simple variant of the RJCE method\nbased on a single reference color, (H-[4.5um]), can rather accurately remove\ndust effects from previously uninterpretable 2MASS color-magnitude diagrams of\nstars in fields along the heavily reddened Galactic mid-plane, with results far\nsuperior to those derived from application of other dereddening methods.

Our goal was to detect the\nRossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, the anomalous radial velocity observed during\neclipses of rotating stars, which can be used to study the obliquities of\nplanet-hosting stars. For WASP-1 a weak signal of a prograde orbit was detected\nwith ~2sigma confidence, and for WASP-2 no signal was detected. The resulting\nupper bounds on the RM amplitude have different implications for these two\nsystems, because of the contrasting transit geometries and the stellar types.\nBecause WASP-1 is an F7V star, and such stars are typically rapid rotators, the\nmost probable reason for the suppression of the RM effect is that the star is\nviewed nearly pole-on. This implies the WASP-1 star has a high obliquity with\nrespect to the edge-on planetary orbit. Because WASP-2 is a K1V star, and is\nexpected to be a slow rotator, no firm conclusion can be drawn about the\nstellar obliquity.

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,\nthe envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals\nbecause icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via\nstrong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope.

We have re-examined the\nevidence for the Bosma effect by fitting Bosma effect models for 17 galaxies in\nthe THINGS data set, either by scaling the contribution of the HI gas alone or\nby using both the observed stellar disc and HI gas as proxies. The results are\ncompared with two models for exotic cold DM: internally consistent cosmological\nNFW models with constrained compactness parameters, and URC models using fully\nunconstrained Burkert density profiles. The Bosma models that use the stellar\ndiscs as additional proxies are statistically nearly as good as the URC models\nand clearly better than the NFW ones.

By using\nspatially high-pass filtered measurements of the LOS component of the magnetic\nfield, the flow properties are determined separately for magnetic spines\n(relatively strong and vertical field) and inter-spines (weaker and more\nhorizontal field).\n  Results. The dark convective downflows discovered recently in the 538.03 nm\nline are evident also in the 630.15 nm line, and have similar strength. This\nconvective signature is the same in spines and inter-spines. However, the\nstrong radial (Evershed) outflows are found only in the inter-spines.\n  Conclusions. At the spatial resolution of the present SST/CRISP data, the\nsmall-scale intensity pattern seen in continuum images is strongly related to a\nconvective up/down flow pattern that exists everywhere in the penumbra. Earlier\nfailures to detect the dark convective downflows in the interior penumbra can\nbe explained by inadequate spatial resolution in the observed data. \n\n"}

These moments are density\nweighted and their lowest orders are density, momentum density, and stress\nenergy density. The series expansion is convergent on large scales. We perform\nan expansion of these velocity moments into helicity modes, which are\neigenmodes under rotation around the axis of Fourier mode direction,\ngeneralizing the scalar, vector, tensor decomposition of perturbations to an\narbitrary order. We show that only equal helicity moments correlate and derive\nthe angular dependence of the individual contributions to the redshift space\npower spectrum in terms of angle mu between wave vector and line of sight. We\nshow that the dominant term of mu^2 dependence on large scales is the\ncross-correlation between the density and scalar part of momentum density,\nwhich can be related to the time derivative of the matter power spectrum.\nAdditional terms contributing and dominating on small scales are the vector\npart of momentum density-momentum density correlations, the energy\ndensity-density correlations, and the scalar part of anisotropic stress\ndensity-density correlations. Similarly, we identify 7 terms contributing to\nmu^4 dependence. Some of the advantages of the distribution function approach\nare that the series expansion converges on large scales and remains valid in\nmulti-stream situations.

On the\n  Discrepancy in Metallicity between Globular Cluster Systems and their Parent\n  Elliptical Galaxies Abstract: One of the conundrums in extragalactic astronomy is the discrepancy in\nobserved metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) between the two prime\nstellar components of early-type galaxies-globular clusters (GCs) and halo\nfield stars. This is generally taken as evidence of highly decoupled\nevolutionary histories between GC systems and their parent galaxies. Here we\nshow, however, that new developments in linking the observed GC colors to their\nintrinsic metallicities suggest nonlinear color-to-metallicity conversions,\nwhich translate observed color distributions into strongly-peaked, unimodal\nMDFs with broad metal-poor tails. Remarkably, the inferred GC MDFs are similar\nto the MDFs of resolved field stars in nearby elliptical galaxies and those\nproduced by chemical evolution models of galaxies. The GC MDF shape,\ncharacterized by a sharp peak with a metal-poor tail, indicates a virtually\ncontinuous chemical enrichment with a relatively short timescale. The\ncharacteristic shape emerges across three orders of magnitude in the host\ngalaxy mass, suggesting a universal process of chemical enrichment among\nvarious GC systems. Given that GCs are bluer than field stars within the same\ngalaxy, it is plausible that the chemical enrichment processes of GCs ceased\nsomewhat earlier than that of field stellar population, and if so, GCs\npreferentially trace the major, vigorous mode of star formation events in\ngalactic formation. We further suggest a possible systematic age difference\namong GC systems, in that the GC systems in more luminous galaxies are older.\nThis is consistent with the downsizing paradigm of galaxies and supports\nadditionally the similar nature shared by GCs and field stars. Our findings\nsuggest that GC systems and their parent galaxies have shared a more common\norigin than previously thought, and hence greatly simplify theories of galaxy\nformation. \n\n"}

Here, for the first time, we apply\nthe technique of optimal estimation to determine the thermal structure and\ncomposition of an exoplanet by solving the inverse problem. The development of\na suite of radiative transfer and retrieval tools for exoplanet atmospheres is\ndescribed, building upon a retrieval algorithm which is extensively used in the\nstudy of our own solar system.

Additionally, we use\ncontribution functions to assess the vertical sensitivity of the emission\nspectrum to temperatures and molecular composition. Over the altitudes probed\nby the contribution functions, the retrieved thermal structure shows an\nisothermal upper atmosphere overlying a deeper adiabatic layer (temperature\ndecreasing with altitude), which is consistent with previously-reported\ndynamical and observational results. The formal uncertainties on retrieved\nparameters are estimated conservatively using an analysis of the\ncross-correlation functions and the degeneracy between different atmospheric\nproperties. The formal solution of the inverse problem suggests that the\nuncertainties on retrieved parameters are larger than suggested in previous\nstudies, and that the presence of CO and CH4 is only marginally supported by\nthe available data. Nevertheless, by including as broad a wavelength range as\npossible in the retrieval, we demonstrate that available spectra of HD 189733b\ncan constrain a family of potential solutions for the atmospheric structure. \n\n"}

Under the assumption\nthat mm-wave emission of disks is mostly optically thin, these data have been\ngenerally interpreted as evidence for the presence of mm/cm-sized pebbles in\nthe disk outer regions. In this work we investigate the effect of possible\nlocal optically thick regions on the mm-wave emission of protoplanetary disks\nwithout mm/cm-sized grains.

We calculate the\nfilling factors and implied overdensities these optically thick regions would\nneed to significantly affect the millimeter fluxes of disks, and we discuss\ntheir plausibility. We find that optically thick regions characterized by\nrelatively small filling factors can reproduce the mm-data of young disks\nwithout requesting emission from mm/cm-sized pebbles. However, these optically\nthick regions require dust overdensities much larger than what predicted by any\nof the physical processes proposed in the literature to drive the concentration\nof solids.

We investigate whether the behaviour of the number of objects per\n`flux' bin (logN-logF) and that of the stacked signal could be used as a\nsignature of the dominant process at stake.We use the CLUMPY code to integrate\nthe signal from decaying or annihilating dark matter and cosmic rays along the\nline of sight. We assume the standard NFW profile for the dark matter density\nand rely on a parametrised emissivity for the cosmic-ray component. In this\ncontext, the consequences of stacking are explored using the MCXC\nmeta-catalogue of galaxy clusters. We find the value of the slope of the\nlogN-logF power law (or the increase of the signal with the number of stacked\nobjects) to be a clear diagnosis to disentangle decaying dark matter from\ncosmic-ray induced gamma-rays. For dark matter annihilation, depending on the\nsignal boost from the substructures, it is either similar to the cosmic-ray\nsignal (no boost) or similar to the decay case (large boosts). The shift\nbetween the brightest object and its followers also depends on the signal\norigin. For annihilation, this shift and the stacked signal are poorly\nconstrained because of the large uncertainty affecting the boost.

In order to investigate\nthe effect of very strong magnetic field, we focus only on systems in which a\nmaximum of either one, two or three Landau level(s) is/are occupied. This is\nimportant since, if a very large number of Landau levels are filled, it implies\na very low magnetic field strength which yields back Chandrasekhar's celebrated\nnon-magnetic results. The maximum number of occupied Landau levels is fixed by\nthe correct choice of two parameters, namely the magnetic field strength and\nthe maximum Fermi energy of the system.

We post-process a global climate model of an Earth-like\nplanet to simulate reflected lightcurves. Significantly, we obtain glint-like\nphase variations even though we do not include specular reflection in our\nmodel. This false positive is the product of two generic properties: 1) for\nmodest obliquities, a planet's poles receive less orbit-averaged stellar flux\nthan its equator, so the poles are more likely to be covered in highly\nreflective snow and ice, and 2) we show that reflected light from a\nmodest-obliquity planet at crescent phases probes higher latitudes than at\ngibbous phases, therefore a planet's apparent albedo will naturally increase at\ncrescent phase. We suggest that this \"latitude-albedo effect\" will operate even\nfor large obliquities: in that case the equator receives less orbit-averaged\nflux than the poles, and the equator is preferentially sampled at crescent\nphase. Using rotational and orbital color variations to map the surfaces of\ndirectly imaged planets and estimate their obliquity will therefore be a\nnecessary pre-condition for properly interpreting their reflected phase\nvariations.

However, people often wonder why this is the case.\nIn order for this approach to be valid, the perturbed Hamiltonian constraint\nand matter-field equations on large scales must, with a suitable choice of\ncoordinates, take on the same forms as the corresponding unperturbed equations.\nWe find that this is possible when (1) the unperturbed metric is given by a\nhomogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric; and (2)\non large scales and with a suitable choice of coordinates, one can ignore the\nshift vector (g0i) as well as time-dependence of tensor perturbations to\ngij/a2(t) of the perturbed metric.

In the Milky Way,\nclusters with more than 2000 stars only form in two types - starburst clusters\nand leaky clusters - each following a unique temporal development in the\nmass-radius plane. The aim is here to determine the encounter probability in\nthe range relevant to solar system formation for starburst or leaky cluster\nenvironments as a function of cluster age. N-body methods are used to\ninvestigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions\nbetween cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs. Using\nthe now available knowledge of the cluster density at a given cluster age it is\ndemonstrated that in starburst clusters the central densities over the first\n5Myr are so high (initially > 10^5 Msun pc^{-3}) that hardly any discs with\nsolar system building potential would survive this phase. This makes a\nstarburst clusters an unlikely environment for the formation of our solar\nsystem. Instead it is highly probable that the solar system formed in a leaky\ncluster (often classified as OB association). It is demonstrated that an\nencounter determining the characteristic properties existing in our solar\nsystems most likely happened very early on (< 2Myr) in its formation history\nand that after 5Myr the likelihood of a solar-type star experiencing such an\nencounter in a leaky cluster is negligible even if it was still part of the\nbound remnant. This explains why the solar system could develop and maintain\nits high circularity later in its development. \n\n"}

Transit detection\ndepends not only on the planet's radius and orbital period, but also on host\nstar properties. Thus, a sample of stars with transiting planets may not\naccurately represent the target population. Moreover, targets are selected\nusing criteria such as a limiting apparent magnitude. These selection effects,\ncombined with uncertainties in stellar radius, lead to biases in the properties\nof transiting planets and their host stars. We quantify possible biases in the\nKepler survey. First, Eddington bias produced by a steep planet radius\ndistribution and uncertainties in stellar radius results in a 15-20%\noverestimate of planet occurrence. Second, the magnitude limit of the Kepler\ntarget catalog induces Malmquist bias towards large, more luminous stars and\nunderestimation of the radii of about one third of candidate planets,\nespecially those larger than Neptune. Third, because metal-poor stars are\nsmaller, stars with detected planets will be very slightly (<0.02 dex) more\nmetal-poor than the target average. Fourth, uncertainties in stellar radii\nproduce correlated errors in planet radius and stellar irradiation. A previous\nfinding, that highly-irradiated giant are more likely to have \"inflated\" radii,\nremains significant, even accounting for this effect. In contrast, transit\ndepth is negatively correlated with stellar metallicity even in the absence of\nany intrinsic correlation, and a previous claim of a negative correlation\nbetween giant planet transit depth and stellar metallicity is probably an\nartifact. \n\n"}

This correlation has been disputed by various authors, and\nour aim is to assess whether it is an intrinsic GRB property or the consequence\nof selection effects. We constructed a sample of Fermi GRBs with homogeneous\nselection criteria, and we studied their distribution in the Epi-Eiso plane.\nOur sample is made of 43 GRBs with a redshift and 243 GRBs without a redshift.\nWe show that GRBs with a redshift follow a broad Epi-Eiso relation, while GRBs\nwithout a redshift show several outliers. We use these samples to discuss the\nimpact of selection effects associated with GRB detection and with redshift\nmeasurement. We find that the Epi-Eiso relation is partly due to intrinsic GRB\nproperties and partly due to selection effects. The lower right boundary of the\nEpi-Eiso relation stems from a true lack of luminous GRBs with low Epi. In\ncontrast, the upper left boundary is attributed to selection effects acting\nagainst the detection GRBs with low Eiso and large Epi that appear to have a\nlower signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we demonstrate that GRBs with and\nwithout a redshift follow different distributions in the Epi-Eiso plane. GRBs\nwith a redshift are concentrated near the lower right boundary of the Epi-Eiso\nrelation. This suggests that it is easier to measure the redshift of GRBs close\nto the lower Epi-Eiso boundary. In this context, we attribute the controversy\nabout the reality of the Amati relation to the complex nature of this relation\nresulting from the combination of a true physical boundary and biases favoring\nthe detection and the measurement of the redshift of GRBs located close to this\nboundary. \n\n"}

The phenomenology of such\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretors is particularly rich when an accretion\ndisc forms around the secondary. The outer radius of such discs is commonly\nestimated from the net angular momentum produced by a density variation of\nmaterial across the BHL or Bondi accretion cylinder, as the latter is tilted\nwith respect to the direction to the primary due to orbital motion. But this\napproach has ignored the fact that the wind experiences an outward driving\nforce that the secondary does not. In actuality, the accretion stream falls\ntoward a retarded point in the secondary's orbit as the secondary is pulled\ntoward the primary relative to the stream. The result is a finite separation or\n\"accretion stream impact parameter\" (ASIP) separating the secondary and stream.\nWhen the orbital radius a_o exceeds the BHL radius r_b, the ratio of outer disc\nradius estimated as the ASIP to the conventional estimate\na_o^{1/2}/r_b^{1/2}>1.

Photospheric\n  Properties Abstract: Measurements of masses and ages of young stars from their location in the HR\ndiagram are limited by not only the typical observational uncertainties that\napply to field stars, but also by large systematic uncertainties related to\ncircumstellar phenomena. In this paper, we analyze flux calibrated optical\nspectra to measure accurate spectral types and extinctions of 283 nearby T\nTauri stars. The primary advances in this paper are (1) the incorporation of a\nsimplistic accretion continuum in optical spectral type and extinction\nmeasurements calculated over the full optical wavelength range and (2) the\nuniform analysis of a large sample of stars. Comparisons between the\nnon-accreting TTS photospheric templates and stellar photosphere models are\nused to derive conversions from spectral type to temperature. Differences\nbetween spectral types can be subtle and difficult to discern, especially when\naccounting for accretion and extinction. The spectral types measured here are\nmostly consistent with spectral types measured over the past decade. However,\nour new spectral types are 1-2 subclasses later than literature spectral types\nfor the original members of the TWA and are discrepant with literature values\nfor some well known Taurus CTTSs.

Resultantly,\nan ambipolar diffusion occurs, and charged species can move differently from\nneutral species, which collapses gravitationally during the structure\nformation. We assume a gravitational contraction of neutral matter in a\nspherically symmetric structure, and calculate fluid motions of charged and\nneutral species. It is shown that the charged fluid, i.e., proton, electron and\n$^7$Li$^+$, can significantly decouple from the neutral fluid depending on the\nfield amplitude. The charged species can, therefore, escape from the\ngravitational collapse. We take the structure mass, the epoch of the\ngravitational collapse, and the comoving Lorenz force as parameters.

This type of\nchemical separation can reduce the abundance ratio of Li/H in early structures\nbecause of inefficient contraction of $^7$Li$^+$ ion. Therefore, it may explain\nLi abundances of Galactic metal-poor stars which are smaller than the\nprediction in standard big bang nucleosynthesis model.

Our simulations produce a large\nincrease of SFR with density at z=1, as in the observations of Elbaz et al. We\nalso find a significant evolution to z=0, where the SFR-density relation is\nmuch flatter. The color-density relation in our simulations is consistent from\nz=1 to z=0, in agreement with observations. We find that the increase in the\nmedian SFR with local density at z=1 is due to a growing population of\nstar-forming galaxies in higher-density environments. At z=0 and z=1 both the\nSFR and cold gas mass are tightly correlated with the galaxy halo mass, and\ntherefore the correlation between median halo mass and local density is an\nimportant cause of the SFR-density relation at both redshifts. We also show\nthat the local density on 1 Mpc/h scales affects galaxy SFRs as much as halo\nmass at z=0. Finally, we find indications that the role of the 1 Mpc/h scale\nenvironment reverses from z=0 to z=1: at z=0 high-density environments depress\ngalaxy SFRs, while at z=1 high-density environments tend to increase SFRs. \n\n"}

With the two\nsuccessive period ratios both near and slightly larger than 2, the system may\nhave evolved from pairwise 2:1 mean motion resonances (MMRs).

Three routines are found to probably result\nin the current configuration under tidal dissipation with the center star, they\nare: (i) through apsidal alignment only; (ii) out of pairwise 2:1 MMRs, then\nthrough apsidal alignment; (iii) out of the 4:2:1 Laplace Resonance (LR) , then\nthrough apsidal alignment. All the three scenarios require the initial\neccentricities of planets $\\sim0.15$, which implies a planetary scattering\nhistory during and after the gas disk was depleted.

We recover the sequence in\nassociation of different SN types to the star-forming regions by using several\nindicators of the ongoing and recent SF related to both the ionized gas and the\nstellar populations. While the total ongoing SF is on average the same for the\nthree SN types, SNe Ibc/IIb tend to happen closer to star-forming regions and\noccur in higher SF density locations compared to SNe II and SNe~Ia, the latter\nshowing the weakest correlation. SNe~Ia host galaxies have on average masses\nthat are $\\sim$0.3-0.8~dex higher than CC SNe hosts due to a larger fraction of\nold stellar populations in the SNe~Ia hosts. Using the recent SN~Ia delay-time\ndistribution and the SFHs of the galaxies, we show that the SN~Ia hosts in our\nsample should presently produce a factor 2 more SNe~Ia than the CC~SN hosts.\nSince both types are in hosts with similar SF rate and hence similar CC~SN\nrate, this can explain the mass difference between the SN~Ia and CC~SN hosts,\nand reinforce the finding that at least part of SNe~Ia should originate from\nvery old progenitors. Comparing the mean SFH of the eight least massive\ngalaxies to that of the massive SF SN~Ia hosts we find that the low-mass\ngalaxies formed their stars over more extended time than the massive SN~Ia\nhosts. We estimate that the low-mass galaxies should produce by a factor of 10\nless SNe~Ia, and a factor of 3 less CC~SNe than the high-mass group. Therefore\nthe ratio between the number of CC~SNe and SNe~Ia is expected to increase with\ndecreasing the galaxy mass.

Accompanying synchrotron radio emission is produced\nby the shock interaction between the jet and the dense circumnuclear medium,\nsimilar to a gamma-ray burst afterglow. An open mystery, however, is the origin\nof the late-time radio rebrightening, which occurred well after the peak of the\njetted X-ray emission.

Our main conclusion is that the radio afterglow of Swift\nJ1644+57 is not naturally explained by a jet with a one-dimensional top-hat\nangular structure.

Our\nsimulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the\nefficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization\nif radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams\nself-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the\nintersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a\ngeometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring\nrapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a\ngeometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is\nefficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and\nforms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated\nenergy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the\nsubsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to\n~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find\nthat a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced\ncircularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning\nblack hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably\nlong in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black\nhole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important\nnodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the\nother hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in\nthe radiatively inefficient case. We also discuss the relationship between our\nsimulations and the parabolic TDEs that are characteristic of most stellar\ntidal disruptions. \n\n"}

This idea has been successfully applied within the\nsetting of group field theory (GFT), a quantum field theory of 'atoms of space'\nwhich can form such a condensate. We further clarify the interpretation of this\nmean-field approximation, and show how it can be used to obtain a semiclassical\ndescription of the GFT, in which the mean field encodes a classical statistical\ndistribution of geometric data. In this sense, GFT condensates are quantum\nhomogeneous geometries that also contain statistical information about\ncosmological inhomogeneities.

We construct probability\ndistribution functions of $kT$ and $n_et$, and model them with several\nGaussians, in order to characterize the average thermal and ionization states\nof such an extended source. We construct equivalent width (EW) maps based on\ncontinuum interpolation with the spectral model of each regions.

We extracted more than 1,000\nspectra from individual stars and identified early-type stars based on their\nspectra. Our data set contains 114 bright early-type stars: 6 have narrow\nemission lines, 23 are Wolf-Rayet stars, 9 stars have featureless spectra, and\n76 are O/B type stars. Our wide-field spectroscopic data confirm that the\ndistribution of young stars is compact, with 90% of the young stars identified\nwithin 0.5 pc of the nucleus.

The jets that are launched by the accreting NS or black\nhole (BH) maintain their axis due to a rapidly rotating pre-collapse core, and\ndo not manage to eject core material from near the equatorial plane. The jets\nare able to eject material from the core along the polar directions, and reduce\nthe gravity near the equatorial plane. The equatorial gas expands, and part of\nit falls back over a timescale of minutes to days to prolong the jets-launching\nepisode.

In particular, the\ngravitational collapse of streaming-initiated clumps leads to an initial\nplanetesimal mass function that is well-represented by a power-law, dN/dM ~\nM^{-p}, with p = 1.6 +/- 0.1, which equates to a differential size distribution\ndN/dR ~ R^{-q}, with q = 2.8 +/- 0.1.

In this work we analyze this\nproblem by studying the physical properties of three different samples of\nparent sources candidates: steep-spectrum radio-loud NLS1s, radio-quiet NLS1s,\nand disk-hosted radio-galaxies, along with compact steep-spectrum sources. In\nour approach, we first derived black hole mass and Eddington ratio from the\noptical spectra, then we investigated the interaction between the jet and the\nnarrow-line region from the [O III] $\\lambda\\lambda$4959,5007 lines. Finally,\nthe radio luminosity function allowed us to compare their jet luminosity and\nhence determine the relations between the samples. \n\n"}

Several cases are explored, considering different jet-star\ninteraction locations, magnetic fields and observer lines of sight. The jet\nluminosity and star properties are fixed, but the results are easily scalable\nunder changes of these parameters. Individual jet-star interactions produce\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) emission that peaks from X-rays to MeV\nenergies (depending on the magnetic field), and at $\\sim 100-1000$ GeV\n(depending on the stellar type), respectively.

In this process, rotational energy of the magnetar is radiated via\nmagnetic dipole radiation and heats the supernova ejecta. However, if magnetars\nare highly distorted in their geometric shape, rotational energy is mainly lost\nas gravitational wave radiation and thus such magnetars cannot power SLSNe.

There is a strong bias against identifying\nAGN at any wavelength in low mass galaxies, and an additional bias against\nidentifying IR AGN in the most massive galaxies. AGN hosts span a wide range of\nstar formation rate (SFR), similar to inactive galaxies once stellar mass\nselection effects are accounted for.

We start with a system of $M0$-branes with high symmetry, which\njoin mutually and form pairs of $M1$-anti-$M1$-branes. The resulting symmetry\nbreaking creates gauge fields that live on the $M1$-branes and play the role of\ngraviton tensor modes, which induce an attractive force between the $M1$ and\nanti-$M1$ branes. Consequently, the gauge fields that live on the $M1$-branes,\nand the scalar fields which are attached symmetrically to all parts of these\nbranes, decay to fermions that attach anti-symmetrically to the upper and lower\nparts of the branes, and hence the Pauli exclusion principle emerges. By\nclosing $M1$-branes mutually, the curvatures produced by parallel spins will be\ndifferent from the curvatures produced by anti-parallel spins, and this leads\nto an inequality between the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary\nsurface and the number of degrees of freedom in the bulk region. This behavior\nis inherited in the $M3$-brane on which the universe is located, and hence this\nleads to the emergence of the universe expansion and contraction.

First results of the analysis of\n  the data set Abstract: Radial-velocity (RV) signals induce RV variations an order of magnitude\nlarger than the signal created by the orbit of Earth-twins, thus preventing\ntheir detection. The goal of this paper is to compare the efficiency of the\ndifferent methods used to deal with stellar signals to recover extremely\nlow-mass planets despite. However, because observed RV variations at the m/s\nprecision level or below is a combination of signals induced by unresolved\norbiting planets, by the star, and by the instrument, performing such a\ncomparison using real data is extremely challenging. To circumvent this\nproblem, we generated simulated RV measurements including realistic stellar and\nplanetary signals. Different teams analyzed blindly those simulated RV\nmeasurements, using their own method to recover planetary signals despite\nstellar RV signals. By comparing the results obtained by the different teams\nwith the planetary and stellar parameters used to generate the simulated RVs,\nit is therefore possible to compare the efficiency of these different methods.\nThe most efficient methods to recover planetary signals {take into account the\ndifferent activity indicators,} use red-noise models to account for stellar RV\nsignals and a Bayesian framework to provide model comparison in a robust\nstatistical approach. Using the most efficient methodology, planets can be\nfound down to K/N= K_pl/RV_rms*sqrt{N_obs}=5 with a threshold of K/N=7.5 at the\nlevel of 80-90% recovery rate found for a number of methods.

This study is part of a larger\ncampaign that aims to robustly calibrate mass-observable scaling relations over\na wide range in redshift to enable improved cosmological constraints from the\nSPT cluster sample. We introduce new strategies to ensure that systematics in\nthe lensing analysis do not degrade constraints on cluster scaling relations\nsignificantly. First, we efficiently remove cluster members from the source\nsample by selecting very blue galaxies in V-I colour. Our estimate of the\nsource redshift distribution is based on CANDELS data, where we carefully mimic\nthe source selection criteria of the cluster fields. We apply a statistical\ncorrection for systematic photometric redshift errors as derived from Hubble\nUltra Deep Field data and verified through spatial cross-correlations. We\naccount for the impact of lensing magnification on the source redshift\ndistribution, finding that this is particularly relevant for shallower surveys.\nFinally, we account for biases in the mass modelling caused by miscentring and\nuncertainties in the concentration-mass relation using simulations. In\ncombination with temperature estimates from Chandra we constrain the\nnormalisation of the mass-temperature scaling relation ln(E(z) M_500c/10^14\nM_sun)=A+1.5 ln(kT/7.2keV) to A=1.81^{+0.24}_{-0.14}(stat.) +/- 0.09(sys.),\nconsistent with self-similar redshift evolution when compared to lower redshift\nsamples.

This study presents a preliminary set of evolutionary models of\ncompact stellar clusters with initial masses ranging over\n$1.0\\times10^4M_\\odot-5.0\\times10^4M_\\odot$, and half-mass radius of 2 pc or 1\npc, that is typical for young massive and starburst clusters. They have\nmetallicities between $0.05Z_\\odot-Z_\\odot$. Including contemporary schemes for\nstellar wind and remnant-formation, such model clusters are evolved, for the\nfirst time, using the state-of-the-art direct N-body evolution program NBODY7,\nuntil their dissolution or at least for 10 Gyr. That way, a self-regulatory\nbehaviour in the effects of dynamical interactions among the BHs, especially\nwhile heating and expanding the cluster and self-depleting the BHs, is\ndemonstrated. The BBH mergers obtained here show a prominence in\ntriple-mediated mergers while being bound to the clusters, compared to those\noccurring among the BBHs that are dynamically ejected from the clusters. This\nis in contrast with earlier N-body computations and also with recent\nMonte-Carlo method based ones. A broader mass spectrum of BHs and ejection of\nBBHs generally of wider orbits and in lower numbers, for the cluster masses\nexplored here, might cause this which is yet to be fully understood. Among the\nBBH coalescences obtained here, there are ones that resemble the detected\nGW151226, LVT151012, and GW150914 events and also ones which are even more\nmassive. A preliminary estimate suggests few 10s - 100s of BBH coalescences per\nyear, originating due to dynamics in stellar clusters, that can be detected by\nthe LIGO at its design sensitivity. \n\n"}

We focus\non large scales where cosmic density fields are quasi-linear. On these scales,\nthe clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative bias expansion,\nand the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of\ncoefficients of the expansion, called bias parameters. The review begins with a\ndetailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the\nrigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions\nof General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key\ncomponents of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational\nobservables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their\ntime derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all\nthese contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the\npeak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical\nmeaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection\nbetween bias parameters and galaxy statistics.

Here we present Chempy, a newly\ndeveloped code for GCE modeling, representing a parametrized open one-zone\nmodel within a Bayesian framework. A Chempy model is specified by a set of 5-10\nparameters that describe the effective galaxy evolution along with the stellar\nand star-formation physics: e.g. the star-formation history, the feedback\nefficiency, the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the incidence of\nsupernova type Ia (SN Ia). Unlike established approaches, Chempy can sample the\nposterior probability distribution in the full model parameter space and test\ndata-model matches for different nucleosynthetic yield sets. We extend Chempy\nto a multi-zone scheme. As an illustrative application, we show that\ninteresting parameter constraints result from only the ages and elemental\nabundances of Sun, Arcturus and the present-day interstellar medium (ISM). For\nthe first time, we use such information to infer IMF parameter via GCE\nmodeling, where we properly marginalize over nuisance parameters and account\nfor different yield sets.

In the outer regions ($\\rm\nR > 2.0 ~R_e$) we detect a mild flattening of the metallicity gradient in\nstacked profiles, although with low significance. The N/O ratio gradient\nprovides complementary constraints on the average chemical enrichment history.\nUnlike the oxygen abundance, the average N/O profiles do not flatten out in the\ncentral regions of massive galaxies. The metallicity and N/O profiles both\ndepart significantly from an exponential form, suggesting a disconnect between\nchemical enrichment and stellar mass surface density on local scales. In the\ncontext of inside-out growth of discs, our findings suggest that central\nregions of massive galaxies today have evolved to an equilibrium metallicity,\nwhile the nitrogen abundance continues to increase as a consequence of delayed\nsecondary nucleosynthetic production. \n\n"}

For inside-out\ngrowing discs, today's thick-disc stars at R_0 are dominated by outwards\nmigrators. Whether outwards migrators are vertically hotter than non-migrators\ndepends on the radial gradient of the thick disc vertical velocity dispersion.\nThere is an effective upper boundary in angular momentum that thick disc stars\nborn in the centre of a galaxy can reach by migration, which explains the\nfading of the high-alpha sequence outside R_0.

The EDA is shown to be\nsky-noise limited over most of the frequency range measured between 60 and 240\nMHz. By using the EDA in interferometric mode with the MWA, we used calibrated\nvisibilities to measure the absolute sensitivity of the array. The measured\narray sensitivity matches very well with a model based on the array layout and\nmeasured receiver temperature. The results demonstrate the practicality and\nfeasibility of using MWA-style precursor technology for SKA-scale stations. The\nmodular architecture of the EDA allows upgrades to the array to be rolled out\nin a staged approach. Future improvements to the EDA include replacing the\nsecond stage beamformer with a fully digital system, and to transition to using\nRF-over-fibre for the signal output from first stage beamformers. \n\n"}

Thanks to the endeavor of the SH0ES team, the\nuncertainty of the H0 has be dramatically reduced from 10% to 2.4%, with the\npromise to reach even 1% in the near future. In this regard, it is\nfundamentally important to beat and investigate the systematics. This is best\nbe done with other independent good distance indicators. One of the promising\nmethod is the flux-weighted gravity luminosity relation (FGLR) of the blue\nsupergiants. As the blue supergiants are the brightest objects in the galaxies,\nthey can probe distance up to 10 Mpc, with negligible blending effects. While\nthe FGLR method delivered distance in good agreement with other distance\nindicators, it has been shown that this method delivers larger distance in the\ncase of M33 and NGC 55. Here we investigate whether the M33 distance estimate\nof FGLR suffers systematics from stellar variability.

The PSF\nestimate for a galaxy depends on its spectral energy distribution (SED),\nbecause the instrumental PSF is generally a function of the wavelength. In this\npaper we explore various approaches to determine the resulting `effective' PSF\nusing broad-band data.

Star formation is\nfirst quenched by tides as the companion approaches, before being enhanced\nshortly after the collision. The ring ploughs the disc material as it radially\nextends, and almost simultaneously depletes its stellar and gaseous reservoir\ninto the central region, through the spokes, and finally dissolve 200 Myr after\nthe collision.

We examined this expectation\nby comparing the behaviour of the line intensities and the abundances estimated\nthrough different calibrations for slit spectra of HII regions in nearby\ngalaxies, for fibre spectra from the SDSS, and for spaxel spectra of the MaNGA\nsurvey. We found that the S_2 strength is increased significantly in the fibre\nand spaxel spectra. The mean enhancement changes with metallicity and can be as\nlarge as a factor of 2. The mean distortion of R_2 and N_2 is less than a\nfactor of 1.3.

We study cosmic-ray driven disk winds using a\nsimplified semi-analytic model assuming streamlines follow the large-scale\ngravitational potential gradient.

Cosmic ray streaming at the Alfv\\'en speed enables the\neffective sound speed C_eff to increase from the footpoint to a critical point\nwhere C_eff,c = u_c ~ V_H; this differs from thermal winds in which C_eff\ndecreases outward.

We'll review the current status of relevant studies\nand discuss some new approaches to the extinction law. When the extinction law\nis reasonably constrained, distance indicators found in today and future\nsurveys are telling us stellar distribution and more throughout the Galactic\ndisk. Among several useful distance indicators, the focus of this review is\nCepheids and open clusters (especially contact binaries in clusters). These\ntracers are particularly useful for addressing the metallicity gradient of the\nGalactic disk, an important feature for which comparison between observations\nand theoretical models can reveal the evolutionary of the disk. \n\n"}

Due to the copious radiative power of the nucleus, the effects of\nradiative feedback can be detected over the entire host galaxy and sometimes\nwell into the intergalactic space. In this paper we model the observed\nsize-luminosity relationship of the narrow-line regions (NLRs) of AGN. We model\nthe NLR as a collection of clouds in pressure equilibrium with the ionizing\nradiation, with each cloud producing line emission calculated by Cloudy. The\nsizes of the NLRs of powerful quasars are reproduced without any free\nparameters, as long as they contain massive ($10^5 - 10^7 M_\\odot$)\nionization-bounded clouds. At lower AGN luminosities the observed sizes are\nlarger than the model sizes, likely due to additional unmodeled sources of\nionization (e.g., star formation). We find that the observed saturation of\nsizes at $\\sim 10$ kpc which is observed at high AGN luminosities\n($L_\\text{ion} \\simeq 10^{46}$ erg/s) is naturally explained by optically thick\nclouds absorbing the ionizing radiation and preventing illumination beyond a\ncritical distance.

Finally, because the gas behind the ionization front is invisible in\nionized gas transitions, emission-based NLR mass calculations underestimate the\nmass of the NLR and therefore of the energetics of ionized-gas winds. \n\n"}

Reliable extinction measurements require very\naccurate photometric calibrations. We show the first step of an iterative\nprocess linking 3D dust maps and photometric calibrations and improving them\nsimultaneously. Our previous 3D map of nearby IS dust was used to select low\nreddening SDSS/APOGEE-DR14 red giants, and this database served for an\nempirical effective temperature- and metallicity-dependent photometric\ncalibration in the Gaia G and 2MASS Ks bands. This calibration has been\ncombined with Gaia G-band empirical extinction coefficients recently published,\nG, J and Ks photometry and APOGEE atmospheric parameters to derive the\nextinction of a large fraction of the survey targets. Distances were estimated\nindependently using isochrones and the magnitude-independent extinction\nK(J-Ks). This new dataset has been merged with the one used for the earlier\nversion of dust map. A new Bayesian inversion of distance-extinction pairs has\nbeen performed to produce an updated 3D map. We present several properties of\nthe new map.

A threshold $\\zeta_{\\rm th}$ for the\ncurvature perturbation is somewhat inappropriate for this purpose, because it\ndepends significantly on environmental effects, not essential to the local\ndynamics.

The tidal disruption of stellar binaries by a massive BH is\nknown to produce hypervelocity stars. However, such a tidal encounter does not\nalways lead to the break-up of binaries. Since surviving binaries tend to\nbecome hard and eccentric, this process can produce BH mergers in principle.\nFor initially circular binaries, we show that the gravitational wave (GW)\nmerger times become shorter by a factor of more than $10^{2}$ ($10^5$) in\n$10\\%$ ($1\\%$) of the surviving cases. This reduction is primarily due to the\ngrowth in binary's eccentricity at the tidal encounter. We also investigate the\neffective spins of the survivors, assuming that BH spins are initially aligned\nwith the binary orbital angular momentum. We find that binary orientations can\nflip in the opposite direction at the tidal encounter. For the survivors with\nlarge merger time reduction factors, the effective spin distribution is rather\nflat. We estimate the merger rate due to the tidal encounter channel to be\n$\\sim 0.6\\ \\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$.

We show that the timescale, on which these\nplanetesimals excite the disc sufficiently for fragmentation, is shorter than\nthe formation timescale of Plutos.

We also calculate the expected number of satellite\ndetections in N fields of data using various ground--based imagers.

If M33 is on its first infall into M31's halo, its\nproposed satellites are expected to remain bound to M33 today. However, if M33\nexperienced a recent tidal interaction with M31, the number of surviving\nsatellites depends strongly on the distance achieved at pericenter due to the\neffects of tidal stripping.

We aim to distinguish these two scenarios using the MaNGA\nsurvey to determine profiles of stellar age, specific star formation rate\n(sSFR) and gas phase metallicity (O/H) as a function of stellar mass surface\ndensity within 1 kpc (Sigma_1kpc) and total stellar mass (M*). We find that\ngradients in age, sSFR and O/H depend on the galaxy's position on the\nSigma_1kpc-M* diagram, suggesting at least two evolutionary pathways. The first\npathway consists of galaxies with low Sigma_1kpc for their M* whose centres are\nold, metal-rich and suppressed in sSFR compared to their outskirts, consistent\nwith the inside-out growth scenario. The second pathway, consistent with a\ncompaction-like core-building scenario, consists of galaxies with higher\nSigma_1kpc for their M*, whose centres are younger, enhanced in sSFR and\nmetal-deficient compared to their outskirts. Moreover, the WISE-selected AGN\nfraction peaks in the same area of the Sigma_1kpc-M* diagram as the\ncore-building pathway. The sSFR profiles of the quiescent population suggest\nthat galaxies on the compaction-like path quench uniformly, while those on the\ninside-out growing path quench their centres first.

One of the most intriguing suggestions\nto resolve the information paradox is due to Bekenstein, who has stressed the\nfact that the low-energy part of the semi-classical black-hole emission\nspectrum is partly blocked by the curvature potential that surrounds the black\nhole. As explicitly shown by Bekenstein, this fact implies that the grey-body\nemission spectrum of a (3+1)-dimensional black hole is considerably less\nentropic than the corresponding radiation spectrum of a perfectly thermal\nblack-body emitter. Using standard ideas from quantum information theory, it\nwas shown by Bekenstein that, in principle, the filtered Hawking radiation\nemitted by a (3+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole may carry with it a\nsubstantial amount of information, the information which was suspected to be\nlost. It is of physical interest to test the general validity of the\n\"information leak\" scenario suggested by Bekenstein as a possible resolution to\nthe Hawking information puzzle. In the present paper we analyze the\nsemi-classical entropy emission properties of higher-dimensional black holes.\nIn particular, we provide evidence that the characteristic Hawking quanta of\n$(D+1)$-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes in the large $D\\gg1$ regime are\nalmost unaffected by the spacetime curvature outside the black-hole horizon.\nThis fact implies that, in the large-$D$ regime, the Hawking black-hole\nradiation spectra are almost purely thermal, thus suggesting that the emitted\nquanta cannot carry the amount of information which is required in order to\nresolve the information paradox. Our analysis therefore suggests that the\nelegant information leak scenario suggested by Bekenstein cannot provide a\ngeneric resolution to the intriguing Hawking information paradox. \n\n"}

This correlation is equivalent to an integral of\nthe bispectrum in the squeezed limit, but is much simpler to implement than the\nusual bispectrum estimators. It also has a clear physical interpretation: it\ndescribes how the small-scale power spectrum of tracers such as galaxies and\nthe 21-cm signal respond to a large-scale environment.

II Abstract: Binary clusters account for more than 10 % of the cluster population in the\nMagellanic Clouds. Statistically fewer than 50 % of the found pairs are\nexpected to be chance superpositions. We estimated the cluster encounter rate\nand suggest that tidal capture is an unlikely formation scenario for the\nformation of binary clusters. Thus, most true binary clusters can be expected\nto have formed together. Here we present a study of three binary cluster\ncandidates which are located in the bar of the LMC. NGC 1971 & NGC 1972 are\nsituated in the association LH 59 in the eastern part of the bar. A third star\ncluster, NGC 1969, is close enough to this pair that all three objects may\nconstitute a triple system. We present the first age determination that is\nbased on CMDs for these star clusters. Our findings suggest that all three\nclusters are young (40-70 Myr) and may have been formed in the same GMC. It\ncannot clearly decided whether the clusters are physically interacting or not.\nNGC 1894 & SL 341 are located at the south-western rim of the LMC bar. This\npair is studied in detail for the first time: The isopleths of both clusters\nreveal an elliptical shape. Whether this might be interpreted as a sign of\ninteraction or is a peculiarity which is shared with a large amount of LMC star\nclusters which show higher ellipticities than their counterparts in the Milky\nWay remains unclear. From our age determination we find that both clusters are\ncoeval with an age of 55+/-5 Myr. This makes a formation from the same GMC a\nlikely scenario.

This can be done by studying the statistical\nproperties of the CMB temperature field at many X-ray cluster positions. At\neach cluster position, the CMB temperature fluctuation will be a combination of\nthe Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) kinematic and thermal components, the cosmological\nfluctuations and the instrument noise term. When averaged over many such\nclusters the last three will integrate down, whereas the first one will be\ndominated by a possible bulk flow component. In particular, we propose to use\nall-sky X-ray cluster catalogs that should (or could) be available soon from\nX-ray satellites, and then to evaluate the dipole component of the CMB field at\nthe cluster positions.

This may either represent randomly enhanced star-forming\nactivity of a dI, or may be caused by a set of special properties of such\nsystems or their environment. For a first investigation of this issue, we\nanalyse the nearby iI,C BCDs Markarian 59 and Markarian 71. Using deep\nground-based spectrophotometric data and HST images, we derive physical\nproperties, structure and ages of the starburst regions and the underlying\nstellar host galaxies. The metallicities show small scatter in the vicinity of\nthe star-forming regions and along the major axis of Mrk 59 which suggests\neffective mixing of heavy elements on kpc scales. The surface brightness\nprofiles of the underlying host galaxies in either iI,C BCD show an exponential\ndecay with a central surface brightness and scale length that are intermediate\nbetween typical iE/nE BCDs and dIs. Spectral population synthesis models in\ncombination with colour magnitude diagrams and colour profiles yield most\nlikely formation ages of ~2 Gyr for the host galaxies in both iI,C BCDs, with\nupper limits of ~4 Gyr for Mrk 59 and ~3 Gyr for Mrk 71, i.e. significantly\nlower than the typical age of several Gyr derived for the host galaxies of\niE/nE BCDs. These findings raise the question whether iI,C systems form a\ndistinct class within BCDs with respect to the age and structure of their\nhosts, or whether they represent an evolutionary stage connecting young i0 BCDs\nand \"classical\" iE/nE BCDs. Properties of analogous objects studied in the\nlocal universe and at medium redshifts provide some support for this\nevolutionary hypothesis. \n\n"}

On the other\nhand, examination of these flares in more detail reveals that each of the\nstrong flares is not a smooth increase and decrease, but exhibits substructures\nof shorter flares having time scales of ~10 ks. We verify via simulations that\nin order to explain the observed structure function, these shorter flares\n(\"shots\") are unlikely to be fully random, but in some way are correlated with\neach other. The energy dependent cross-correlation analysis shows that\ninter-band lags are not universal in TeV blazars. This is important since in\nthe past, only positive detections of lags were reported. In this work, we\ndetermine that the sign of a lag may differ from flare to flare; significant\nlags of both signs were detected from several flares, while no significant lag\nwas detected from others. However, we also argue that the nature of the\nunderlying component can affect these values. The facts that all flares are\nnearly symmetric and that fast variability shorter than the characteristic time\nscale is strongly suppressed, support the scenario where the light crossing\ntime dominates the variability time scales of the day-scale flares. \n\n"}

In addition to\nbeing spatially non-uniform, the CMB is theorized to be slightly polarized.\nMeasurements of this polarization, particularly at large angular scales, have\nthe potential to provide information on primordial gravitational waves,\ntheories of inflation, and the ionization history of the universe, as well as\nhelp further constrain cosmological parameters.\n  Polarization has not yet been detected in the CMB.

I\nperform detailed 2-D decomposition of the M31 double nucleus in the Hubble\nSpace Telescope V-band to study the bulge structure and to address competing\nformation scenarios of the eccentric disk. I deblend the double nucleus (P1 and\nP2) and the bulge simultaneously using five Sersic and one Nuker components.

The spherical bulge mass of 2.8x10^7 M_sol is\ncomparable to the supermassive black hole mass (3x10^7 M_sol). In the 2-D\ndecomposition, the bulge is consistent with being centered near the UV peak of\nP2, but the exact position is difficult to pinpoint because of dust in the\nbulge.

In addition to being larger than the T=0\nmodels, these finite entropy, low-mass (<0.03 solar masses) WDs have a minimum\nmass for a fixed core temperature. If they remain hot as they lose mass and\nexpand, they can ``evaporate'' to leave an isolated millisecond radio pulsar.\nThey also adiabatically expand upon mass loss at a rate faster than the growth\nof the Roche radius if the angular momentum deposited in the disk is not\nreturned to the donor. If the timescale of the resulting runaway mass transfer\nis shorter than the viscous timescale in the outer disk, then the mass transfer\ninstability of Ruderman and Shaham for He WDs would be realized. However, my\nestimates of these timescales still makes the instability unlikely for\nadiabatic responses. I close by noting the possible impact of finite T WDs on\nour understanding of AM CVn binaries. \n\n"}

The\nredshift distribution of GRBs is believed to be broad, extending to z~5, so\nmost events can be assumed to be at large redshifts, and hence subject to weak\nlensing, which would betray itself as projected (anti-)correlations between GRB\nevents and galaxies or clusters that trace the intervening mass. Given the\nobserved distribution of GRBs in fluence, and statistical positional error, e,\nwe predict that most subsets drawn from BATSE Catalog will be anti-correlated\nwith the foreground structure due to weak lensing, i.e. will show negative\nmagnification bias.

Some of these fields are expected to couple with non-standard\nkinetic terms to gravity. In this paper, we study the splitting into adiabatic\nand isocurvature perturbations for a model with two scalar fields, one of which\nhas a non-standard kinetic term in the Einstein-frame action. Such actions can\narise, e.g., in the Pre-Big-Bang and Ekpyrotic scenarios. The presence of a\nnon-standard kinetic term induces a new coupling between adiabatic and\nisocurvature perturbations which is non-vanishing when the potential for the\nmatter fields is nonzero. This coupling is un-suppressed in the long wavelength\nlimit and thus can lead to an important transfer of power from the entropy to\nthe adiabatic mode on super-Hubble scales. We apply the formalism to the case\nof a previously found exact solution with an exponential potential and study\nthe resulting mixing of adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations in this\nexample.

We calculate predicted\nHODs for a Lambda-CDM cosmological model using an SPH hydrodynamic simulation\nand a semi-analytic (SA) galaxy formation model. Although the two methods\npredict different galaxy mass functions, their HOD predictions agree remarkably\nwell. For mass-selected samples, the mean occupation <N(M)> exhibits a sharp\ncutoff at low halo masses, a slowly rising plateau for <N>~1-2, and a more\nsteeply rising high occupancy regime. At low <N>, the mean pair and triple\ncounts are well below Poisson expectations, with important consequences for\nsmall scale behavior of 2- and 3-point correlation functions. The HOD depends\nstrongly on galaxy age, with high mass halos populated mainly by old galaxies\nand low mass halos by young galaxies. The SPH simulation supports several\nsimplifying assumptions about HOD bias: the most massive galaxy in a halo\nusually lies close to the center and moves near the halo's mean velocity;\nsatellite galaxies have the same radial profile and velocity dispersion as the\ndark matter; and the mean occupation at fixed halo mass is independent of the\nhalo's larger scale environment. By applying the SPH and SA HODs to a large\nvolume N-body simulation, we show that both methods predict slight, observable\ndepartures from a power-law galaxy correlation function. The predicted HODs are\nclosely tied to the underlying galaxy formation physics, they offer useful\nguidance to theoretical models of galaxy clustering, and they will be tested\nempirically by ongoing analyses of galaxy redshift surveys.

We find that the cluster correlation strength increases with\nredshift: high redshift clusters are clustered more strongly (in comoving\nscale) than low redshift clusters of the same mass. The increased correlations\nwith redshift, in spite of the decreasing mass correlation strength, is caused\nby the strong increase in cluster bias with redshift: clusters represent higher\ndensity peaks of the mass distribution as the redshift increases. The\nrichness-dependent cluster correlation function, presented as the\ncorrelation-scale versus cluster mean separation relation, R_0 - d, is found to\nbe, remarkably, independent of redshift to z <~ 2 for LCDM and z <~ 1 for TCDM\n(for a fixed correlation function slope and cluster mass within a fixed\ncomoving radius).

Binary\nequilibrium sequences close to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) are\ncalculated to determine the GW frequencies just before merger. It is found that\nEoS effects begin to play a role for gravitational masses larger than\n$M_\\infty\\simeq1.5M_\\odot$. The difference in the gravitational wave frequency\nat the ISCO grows to up to $\\simeq 10%$ for the maximal allowed mass given by\nthe EoSs used.

Supersonic turbulence can provide\nsupport against gravitational collapse on global scales, while at the same time\nit produces localized density enhancements that allow for collapse on small\nscales. The efficiency and timescale of stellar birth in Galactic gas clouds\nstrongly depend on the properties of the interstellar turbulent velocity field,\nwith slow, inefficient, isolated star formation being a hallmark of turbulent\nsupport, and fast, efficient, clustered star formation occurring in its\nabsence. Star formation on scales of galaxies as a whole is expected to be\ncontrolled by the balance between gravity andturbulence, just like star\nformation on scales of individual interstellar gas clouds, but may be modulated\nby additional effects like cooling and differential rotation.

The current\ncalculation focuses on the effect of black hole rotation using general\nrelativistic MHD with simplified microphysics. Initially, we assume that the\ncore collapse is failed in this star. A few solar mass rotating black hole is\ninserted by hand into the calculation. We consider two cases, the co-rotating\ncase and counter-rotating case with respect to the black hole rotation.\nAlthough the counter-rotating case may be unrealistic for collapsar, we perform\nas a maximally dragging case of magnetic field. The simulation results show the\nformation of a disk-like structure and the generation of a jet-like outflow\nnear the central black hole. The jet-like outflow propagates outwardly with the\ntwisted magnetic field and becomes collimated. We have found that the jets are\ngenerated and accelerated mainly by the magnetic field. The total jet velocity\nin the rotating black hole case is comparable to that of the non-rotating black\nhole case (Mizuno et al. 2004), 0.3c. When the rotation of the black hole is\nfaster, the magnetic field is twisted strongly owing to the frame-dragging\neffect. The magnetic energy stored by the twisting magnetic field is converted\nto kinetic energy of the jet directly rather than propagating as an Alfven\nwave. Thus, as the rotation of the black hole becomes faster, the poloidal\nvelocity of the jet becomes faster. In the rapidly rotating black hole case the\njet-like outflow can be produced by the frame dragging effect only through the\ntwisting of magnetic field even if there is no stellar rotation. \n\n"}

If the galaxies\nare elongated because they are highly inclined, alignment of the slit and major\naxis should maximize the observed velocity and reveal velocity shear, if\npresent. In spite of this alignment, we see spatially resolved velocity shear\nin only two galaxies. We show that the seeing makes a large difference in the\nobserved velocity spread of a tilted emission line, and use this information to\nplace limits on the velocity spread of the ionized gas of the galaxies in the\nsample: we find that all 13 have v_{0.5} < 110 km/s, where v_{0.5} is the\nvelocity shear (half of the velocity range of a tilted emission line) that\nwould be observed under our best seeing conditions of ~0.5\". When combined with\nprevious work, our data also indicate that aligning the slit along the major\naxis does not increase the probability of observing a tilted emission line.

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA)\nwill provide the only means of studying the cosmic evolution of neutral\nHydrogen (HI) which, alongside information on star formation from the radio\ncontinuum, is needed to understand how stars formed from gas within dark-matter\nover-densities and the roles of gas accretion and galaxy merging. `All\nhemisphere' HI redshift surveys to redshift 1.5 are feasible with\nwide-field-of-view realizations of the SKA and, by measuring the galaxy power\nspectrum in exquisite detail, will allow the first precise studies of the\nequation-of-state of dark energy. The SKA will be capable of other uniquely\npowerful cosmological studies including the measurement of the dark-matter\npower spectrum using weak gravitational lensing, and the precise measurement of\nH0 using extragalactic water masers.

The galaxies were divided into three\nsubsamples, with mean redshifts z=1.7, 2.2, 2.9, according to the UGR selection\ncriteria of Adelberger et al. (2004) and Steidel et al. (2003). Combining the\ngalaxies' measured angular clustering with redshift distributions inferred from\n1600 spectroscopic redshifts, we find comoving correlation lengths at the three\nredshifts of r_0 = 4.5+-0.6, 4.2+-0.5, and 4.0+-0.6 h^-1 Mpc, respectively, and\ninfer a roughly constant correlation function slope of gamma=1.6+-0.1. We\nderive similar numbers from the 1600 object spectroscopic sample itself with a\nnew statistic, K, that is insensitive to many possible systematics. Galaxies\nthat are bright in R (lambda_rest ~ 1500-2500A) cluster more strongly than\nfainter galaxies at z=2.9 and z=2.2 but not, apparently, at z=1.7.

We find that interstellar\nOVI absorption along all sightlines is generally weak, and in a number of\ncases, completely absent. No OVI absorption was detected with significance\ngreater than 2 sigma for 12 of the 25 stars, where the 1 sigma uncertainty is 4\nmA, equivalent to an OVI column density of ~3 x 10^12 cm^-2. Of the remaining\nstars, most have column densities N(OVI) < 10^13 cm^-2 and no column densities\nexceed 1.7 x 10^13 cm^-2. For lines of sight to hot (T_eff > 40,000 K) white\ndwarfs, there is some evidence that the OVI absorption may be at least\npartially photospheric or circumstellar in origin. We interpret the \"patchy\"\ndistribution of OVI absorption in terms of a model where OVI is formed in\nevaporative interfaces between cool clouds and the hot, diffuse gas in the\nLocal Bubble (LB). If the clouds contain tangled or tangential magnetic fields,\nthen thermal conduction will be quenched over most of the cloud surface, and\nOVI will be formed only in local \"patches\" where conduction is allowed to\noperate. We find an average OVI space density in the LISM of 2.4 x 10^-8 cm^-3,\nwhich is similar to, or slightly larger than, the value in the Galactic disk\nover kpc scales. This local density implies an average OVI column density of ~7\nx 10^12 cm^-2 over a path length of 100 pc within the LB. The OVI data\npresented here appears to be inconsistent with the model proposed by\nBreitschwerdt & Schmutzler (1994), in which highly ionized gas at low kinetic\ntemperature (~50,000 K) permeates the LB. Our survey results are consistent\nwith the supernova-driven cavity picture of Cox & Smith (1974). \n\n"}

We pursue the idea that this\nprocess may be driven by a fossil accretion disc in the centre of our Galaxy,\ncausing the gradual orbital decay of stellar trajectories, while setting some\nstars on highly elliptic orbits. We evolve model orbits that undergo repetitive\ntransitions across the disc over the period of ~10^7 years. We assume that the\ndisc mass is small compared to the central black hole, and its gravitational\nfield comparatively weak, yet non-zero, and we set the present values of\norbital parameters of the model star consistent with those reported for the S2\nstar in Sagittarius A*. We show how a model trajectory decays and circularizes,\nbut at some point the mean eccentricity is substantially increased by Kozai's\nresonance. In consequence the orbital decay of highly eccentric orbits is\naccelerated. A combination of an axially symmetric gravitational field and\ndissipative environment can provide a mechanism explaining the origin of stars\non highly eccentric orbits tightly bound to the central black hole. In the\ncontext of other S-stars, we can conclude that an acceptable mass of the disc\n(i.e., M_d<=1 percent of the black hole mass) is compatible with their\nsurprisingly young age and small pericentre distances, provided these stars\nwere formed at r<=10^5 gravitational radii. \n\n"}

The accretion flow launches energetic jets in the\naxial funnel region of the disk/jet system, as well as a substantial coronal\nwind. The jets feature knot-like structures of extremely hot,\nultra-relativistic gas; the gas in these knots begins at moderate velocities\nnear the inner engine, and is accelerated to ultra-relativistic velocities\n(Lorentz factors of 50, and higher) by the Lorentz force in the axial funnel.\nThe increase in jet velocity takes place in an acceleration zone extending to\nat least a few hundred gravitational radii from the inner engine. The overall\nenergetics of the jets are strongly spin-dependent, with high-spin black holes\nproducing the highest energy and mass fluxes. In addition, with high-spin black\nholes, the ultra-relativistic outflow is cylindrically collimated within a few\nhundred gravitational radii of the black hole, whereas in the zero- spin case\nthe jet retains a constant opening angle of approximately 16 degrees.

A major motivating factor in this\ninvestigation is the observed systematic difference between the chemical\nabundances of stars in satellite galaxies and those in the Milky Way halo.\nSpecifically, for the same [Fe/H] values, stars in neighboring satellite\ngalaxies display significantly lower [alpha/Fe] ratios than stars in the halo.\n  We find that the observed chemical abundance patterns are a natural outcome\nof the process of hierarchical assembly of the Galaxy. This result follows\nbecause the stellar halo in this context is built up from satellite galaxies\naccreted early on (more than 8-9 Gyr ago) and enriched in alpha-elements\nproduced in Type II supernovae. In contrast, satellites which survive today are\ntypically accreted late (within the last 4-5 Gyr) with nearly solar [alpha/Fe]\nvalues as a result of contributions from both Type II and Type Ia supernovae.\nWe use our model to investigate the abundance distribution functions (using\nboth [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] ratios) for stars in the halo and in surviving\nsatellites.

Assuming that\nordinary matter scales canonically, we show that the continuity equation\nunivocally fixes the IR cutoff, provided a law of variation for either\nrho_Lambda or G_N is known. Previous considerations on holographic dark energy\ndisfavor the Hubble parameter as a candidate for the IR cutoff (for spatially\nflat universes), since in this case the ratio of dark energy to dark matter is\nnot allowed to vary, thus hindering a deceleration era of the universe for the\nredshifts z>=0.5. On the other hand, the future event horizon as a choice for\nthe IR cutoff is being favored in the literature, although the `coincidence\nproblem' usually cannot be addressed in that case. We extend considerations to\nspatially curved universes, and show that with the Hubble parameter as a choice\nfor the IR cutoff one always obtains a universe that never accelerates or a\nuniverse that accelerates all the time, thus making the transition from\ndeceleration to acceleration impossible. Next, we apply the IR cutoff\nconsistency procedure to a RG running CC model, in which the low-energy\nvariation of the CC is due to quantum effects of particle fields having masses\nnear the Planck scale. We show that bringing such a model in full accordance\nwith holography amounts to having such an IR cutoff which scales as a square\nroot of the Hubble parameter. We find that such a setup, in which the only\nundetermined input represents the true ground state of the vacuum, can give\nearly deceleration as well as late time acceleration. The possibility of\nfurther improvement of the model is also briefly indicated. \n\n"}

At lower redshift and\nhigher virial temperature, T_vir > 10^4K, electron cooling dominates - we call\nthese generation 2. Radiation fields act to photo-dissociate H_2, but also\ngenerate free electrons that can help to catalyse its production. At modest\nradiation levels, J_{21}/(1+z)^3 ~ 10^{-12}-10^{-7}, the nett effect is to\nenhance the formation of Generation 1 star-clusters.

A model with\nlittle evolution of quasar clustering in comoving coordinates is best explained\nin the current cosmological paradigm by rapid evolution in quasar bias. We show\nthat quasar biasing must have changed from b_Q~3 at a (photometric) redshift of\nz=2.2 to b_Q~1.2-1.3 by z=0.75. Such a rapid increase with redshift in biasing\nimplies that quasars at z~2 cannot be the progenitors of modern L* objects,\nrather they must now reside in dense environments, such as clusters. Similarly,\nthe duration of the UVX quasar phase must be short enough to explain why local\nUVX quasars reside in essentially unbiased structures.

Our results indicate\nthat the bulk of the IGM enrichment is due to spheroids, with dwarf irregular\ngalaxies playing a negligible role. Our predictions grossly account for the\n[O/H] observed in the IGM at high redshift, but overestimate the [C/H].\nFurthermore, it appears hard to reproduce the abundance ratios observed in the\nhigh-redshift IGM. Some possible explanations are discussed in the text. This\nis the first attempt to study the abundance ratios in the IGM by means of\ndetailed chemical evolution models which take into account the stellar\nlifetimes. Numerical simulations adopting our chemical evolution prescriptions\ncould be useful to improve our understanding of the IGM chemical enrichment. \n\n"}

Such models require fine-tuning of highly uncertain microscopic\ntransport properties to distribute the thermal thermal over the entire cluster\ncooling core. We propose that the ICM is instead heated by multiple, spatially\ndistributed AGNs. There is mounting observational evidence for multiple AGNs in\ncluster environments. Active AGNs drive bubbles into the ICM. We identify three\ndistinct interactions between the bubble and the ICM: (1) Upon injection, the\nbubbles expand rapidly in situ to reach pressure equilibrium with their\nsurroundings, generating shocks and waves whose dissipation is the principal\nsource of ICM heating. (2) Once inflated, the bubbles rise buoyantly at rate\ndetermined by a balance with the viscous drag force, which itself results in\nsome additional heating. (3) Rising bubbles expand and compress their\nsurroundings. This process is adiabatic and does not contribute to any\nadditional heating; rather, the increased ICM density due to compression\nenhances cooling. Our model sidesteps the ``transport'' issue by relying on the\nspatially distributed galaxies to heat the cluster core. We include self\nregulation in our model by linking AGN activity in a galaxy to cooling\ncharacteristics of the surrounding ICM. We use a spherically symmetric\none-dimensional hydrodynamical code to carry out a preliminary study\nillustrating the efficacy of the model. Our self-regulating scenario predicts\nthat there should be enhanced AGN activity of galaxies inside the cooling\nregions compared to galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster. This prediction\nremains to be confirmed or refuted by observations. \n\n"}

We are able to explain the current observed diffuse\ngamma-rays and the very detailed 511 keV annihilation line of secondary\npositrons by $p-p$ collisions of such protons, with appropriate injection times\nand energy. Relativistic protons could have been injected into the ambient\nmaterial if the black hole captured a 50M$_\\odot$ star at several tens million\nyears ago. An alternative possibility is that the black hole continues to\ncapture stars with $\\sim$1M$_\\odot$ every hundred thousand years.

Radially resolved spectra obtained with the XMM-Newton\ntelescope are well-characterized by a power-law model with the addition of a\nsoft thermal emission component in varying proportions. These fits reproduce\nthe well-studied increase in the spectral index with radius attributed to\nsynchrotron burn-off of high energy electrons. Most interestingly, a radially\nresolved thermal component is shown to map out a shell-like structure ~6' in\ndiameter. The presence of a strong emission line corresponding to the Ne IX\nHe-like transition requires an overabundance of ~3 x [Ne/Ne(sun)] in the\nRaymond-Smith plasma model. The best-fit temperature kT ~ 0.23 keV is\nessentially independent of radius for the derived column density of N_H = (4.2\n+/- 0.1)E21 per cm squared.

Taken\nmore than a fortnight apart they provide the first insight into the evolution\nof the prominence system on such a young rapidly rotating star.

This suggests that the magnetic\nstructures supporting the prominences retain their identity on a two to three\nweek timescale. We identify prominences as transient absorption features in all\nlines of the Hydrogen Balmer series down to H_10. We use the ratios of the\nprominence EWs in these lines to determine their column densities in the first\nexcited state of hydrogen. We determine the optical depths, finding prominences\nto be rather optically thick (\\tau \\approx 20) in the H_alpha line.

The\nconventional approach to timing explicitly assumes that the radio emitting\nregion is located at the center of the pulsar, while polarimetric observations\nsuggest that radio emission is in fact produced at altitudes ranging from tens\nto thousands of kilometers above the neutron star surface. Here we present a\ncalculation of the effects of finite emission height on the timing of binary\npulsars using a simple model for the emitting region geometry. Finite height of\nemission changes the propagation path of radio photons through the binary and\ngives rise to a large spin velocity of the emission region co-rotating with the\nneutron star. Under favorable conditions these two effects introduce\ncorrections to the conventional time delays at the microsecond level (for a\nmillisecond pulsar in a double neutron star binary with a period of several\nhours and assuming the emission height of 100 km). Exploiting the dependence of\nthe emission height on frequency (radius-to-frequency mapping) and using\nmulti-frequency observations one should be able to detect these timing\ncorrections even though they are formally degenerate with conventional time\ndelays.

Tables of the\nmeasured shear correlation function and the calculated covariance matrix for\neach survey are included.\n  The accuracy of our results is a marked improvement on previous work owing to\nthree important differences in our analysis; we correctly account for cosmic\nvariance errors by including a non-Gaussian contribution estimated from\nnumerical simulations; we correct the measured shear for a calibration bias as\nestimated from simulated data; we model the redshift distribution, n(z), of\neach survey from the largest deep photometric redshift catalogue currently\navailable from the CFHTLS-Deep. This catalogue is randomly sampled to reproduce\nthe magnitude distribution of each survey with the resulting survey dependent\nn(z) parametrised using two different models.

Instead, the method is based on single-dish flux\ndensity monitoring of the (unresolved) lens system's total lightcurve, combined\nwith additional interferometric measurements of the flux density ratio at a few\nepochs during that monitoring period. The basic idea of the method is to\nreconstruct the individual image lightcurves from the observed total lightcurve\nby assuming a range of potential values for the time delay and the\nmagnification ratio of the images. It is then possible to single out the\ncorrect reconstruction, and therefore determine the time delay, by checking the\nconsistency of the reconstructed individual lightcurves with the additional\ninterferometric observations. We performed extensive numerical simulations of\nsynthetic lightcurves to investigate the dependence of the performance of this\nmethod on various parameters which are involved in the problem. Probably the\nmost promising candidates for applying the method (and also for determining the\nHubble constant) are lens systems consisting of multiply imaged compact sources\nand an Einstein ring, such as B0218+357 from which some of the parameters used\nfor our simulations were adopted. \n\n"}

These observations are consistent\nwith NFW halo profiles, with the possible exception of a few LSBs where the\nrotation curves are better described by shallower central density profiles.\nConsistency with observational trends requires that halos have lower\ncharacteristic densities than expected in the standard biased cold dark matter\n(CDM) scenario, but roughly compatible with COBE-normalized, low-density, flat\nCDM universes. The data also imply that disk mass-to-light ratios increase\ngently with luminosity, and that the halo circular velocity, V_200, is not\ndirectly proportional to the disk rotation speed, V_rot. Slowly rotating disks\nare surrounded by halos of higher circular velocities, whereas faster rotators\n(V_rot > 150 km/s) are all surrounded by halos of similar mass, corresponding\nto V_200 ~ 200 km/s.

The color distribution of the galaxies in the cluster is\nquite broad and the fraction of blue galaxies (\\sim 70%) is much larger than in\nintermediate-redshift clusters.

These inhomogeneities lead to\ndifferent element abundance patterns in very metal-poor stars, which can be\nseen as scatter in the abundances of halo stars with metallicities [Fe/H] <\n2.0. The early chemical evolution of the halo proceeds in different enrichment\nphases: At [Fe/H] < -3.0, the halo ISM is unmixed and dominated by local\ninhomogeneities caused by single core-collapse supernova (SN) events.

In contrast\nto modifications of general relativity based on metric geometry, no continuous\ndeformation scale needs to be introduced; the extension to area geometry is\npurely structural and thus rigid.

Hence it\nis important to examine in details uncertainties (and values) of inputs to the\nSSM. Currently, the largest fractional uncertainty is due to the new evaluation\nof the surface composition of the sun. We examine the nuclear input on the\nformation of solar 8B [S17(0)] and demonstrate that it is still quite uncertain\ndue to ill known slope of the measured astrophysical cross section factor and\nthus ill defined extrapolation to zero energy. This yields an additional\nreasonably estimated uncertainty due to extrapolation of +0.0 -3.0 eV-b (+0%\n-14%). Since a large discrepancy exists among measured as well as among\npredicted slopes, the value of S17(0) is dependent on the choice of data and\ntheory used to extrapolate S17(0). This situation must be alleviated by new\nmeasurement(s). The \"world average\" is driven by the Seattle result due to the\nvery small quoted uncertainty, which we however demonstrate it to be an\nover-estimated accuracy. We propose more realistic error bars for the Seattle\nresults based on the published Seattle data. \n\n"}

The nuclear weak charge and current operators have vector and\naxial-vector components, that include one- and many-body terms. All possible\nmultipole transitions connecting any of the p 3He S- and P-wave channels to the\n4He bound state are considered. The S-factor at a p 3He center-of-mass energy\nof 10 keV, close to the Gamow-peak energy, is predicted to be 10.1 10^{-20} keV\nb with the AV18/UIX Hamiltonian, a factor of about 4.5 larger than the value\nadopted in the standard solar model. The P-wave transitions are found to be\nimportant, contributing about 40 % of the calculated S-factor. The energy\ndependence is rather weak: the AV18/UIX zero-energy S-factor is 9.64 10^{-20}\nkeV b, only 5 % smaller than the 10 keV result quoted above. The model\ndependence is also found to be weak: the zero-energy S-factor is calculated to\nbe 10.2 10^{-20} keV b with the older AV14/UVIII model, only 6 % larger than\nthe AV18/UIX result. Our best estimate for the S-factor at 10 keV is therefore\n(10.1 \\pm 0.6) 10^{-20} keV b, when the theoretical uncertainty due to the\nmodel dependence is included. This value for the calculated S-factor is not as\nlarge as determined in fits to the Super-Kamiokande data in which the hep flux\nnormalization is free. However, the precise calculation of the S-factor and the\nconsequent absolute prediction for the hep neutrino flux will allow much\ngreater discrimination among proposed solar neutrino oscillation solutions. \n\n"}
