Edges may be\nweighted if the interaction strength is measurable. However, the full network\ninformation is often redundant because tools and techniques from network\nanalysis do not work or become very inefficient if the network is too dense and\nsome weights may just reflect measurement errors, and shall be discarded.\nMoreover, since weight distributions in many complex weighted networks are\nbroad, most of the weight is concentrated among a small fraction of all edges.\nIt is then crucial to properly detect relevant edges. Simple thresholding would\nleave only the largest weights, disrupting the multiscale structure of the\nsystem, which is at the basis of the structure of complex networks, and ought\nto be kept. In this paper we propose a weight filtering technique based on a\nglobal null model (GloSS filter), keeping both the weight distribution and the\nfull topological structure of the network. The method correctly quantifies the\nstatistical significance of weights assigned independently to the edges from a\ngiven distribution. Applications to real networks reveal that the GloSS filter\nis indeed able to identify relevantconnections between vertices. \n\n"}

However, they do not establish that the entropy loss during the\nglass transition is accompanied by a concomitant entropy gain of the medium to\nmaintain the second law. They use a novel statistical formulation of entropy\nbased on several conjectures such as it being zero for a microstate, but do not\ncompare its behavior with the thermodynamic entropy. The formulation is\ndesigned to show the entropy loss. Its subsequent rise not only contradicts our\nresult but also implies that the glass during relaxation must have a negative\nabsolute temperature.

The effective dielectric constant of the\nsolvated protein, representing the average dipole moment induced at the protein\nby a uniform external field, shows a remarkable variation among the proteins\nstudied by numerical simulations. It changes from 0.5 for ubiquitin to 640 for\ncytochrome c. The former value implies a negative dipolar susceptibility of\nubiquitin, that is a dia-electric dipolar response and negative\ndielectrophoresis. It means that a protein carrying an average dipole of ~240 D\nis expected to repel from the region of a stronger electric field. This outcome\nis the result of a negative cross-correlation between the protein and water\ndipoles, compensating for the positive variance of the protein dipole in the\noverall dipolar susceptibility. This phenomenon can be characterized as\noverscreening of protein's dipole by the hydration shell. In contrast to the\nneutral ubiquitin, charged proteins studied here show para-electric dipolar\nresponse and positive dielectrophoresis.

We first investigate the effects of different kinds of weak ties on\nthe variabilities of both the arrival time and the prevalence of disease, and\nfind that the bridgeness with small degree can enhance the predictability of\nepidemic spreading. Once weak ties are settled, compared with the variability\nof arrival time, the variability of prevalence displays a diametrically opposed\nchanging trend with both the distance of the initial seed to the bridgeness and\nthe degree of the initial seed.

This\nquestion is at the heart of solid state NMR. There, an initially local\npolarization spreads all over due to spin-spin interactions that conserve the\ntotal spin projection, leading to an equilibration of the polarization. In\nprinciple, this quantum dynamics can be reversed by changing the sign of the\nHamiltonian.

The subgroups form a rich hierarchy and allow\nfor many different phases of matter with orientational order. Such spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking occurs in nematic liquid crystals and a highlight of such\nanisotropic liquids are the uniaxial and biaxial nematics. Generalizing the\nfamiliar uniaxial and biaxial nematics to phases characterized by an arbitrary\npoint group symmetry, referred to as \\emph{generalized nematics}, leads to a\nlarge hierarchy of phases and possible orientational phase transitions. We\ndiscuss how a particular class of nematic phase transitions related to axial\npoint groups can be efficiently captured within a recently proposed gauge\ntheoretical formulation of generalized nematics [K. Liu, J. Nissinen, R.-J.\nSlager, K. Wu, J. Zaanen, Phys. Rev. X {\\bf 6}, 041025 (2016)].

We call this\nstochastic diffusion process the (ageing) underdamped scaled Brownian motion\n(UDSBM). We demonstrate how the mean squared displacement (MSD) and the time\naveraged MSD of UDSBM are affected by the inertial term in the Langevin\nequation, both at short, intermediate, and even long diffusion times. In\nparticular, we quantify the ballistic regime for the MSD and the time averaged\nMSD as well as the spread of individual time averaged MSD trajectories. One of\nthe main effects we observe is that---both for the MSD and the time averaged\nMSD---for superdiffusive UDSBM the ballistic regime is much shorter than for\nordinary Brownian motion. In contrast, for subdiffusive UDSBM the ballistic\nregion extends to much longer diffusion times. Therefore, particular care needs\nto be taken when the overdamped limit indeed provides a correct description,\neven in the long time limit.

According to the relation,\nnonequilibrium output generated from dissipative processes necessarily incurs\nan energetic cost or heat dissipation $q$, and in order to limit the output\nfluctuation within a relative uncertainty $\\epsilon$, at least\n$2k_BT/\\epsilon^2$ of heat must be dissipated. Our model shows that this bound\nis attained not only at near-equilibrium ($f\\ll V'(x)$) but also at\nfar-from-equilibrium $(f\\gg V'(x))$, more generally when the dissipated heat is\nnormally distributed. Furthermore, the energetic cost is maximized near the\ncritical force when the barrier separating the potential wells is about to\nvanish and the fluctuation of Brownian particle is maximized. These findings\nindicate that the deviation of heat distribution from Gaussianity gives rise to\nthe inequality of the uncertainty relation, further clarifying the meaning of\nthe uncertainty relation.

Most of these are\neffectively \"fabric evolution models\" (FEMs) based on a stress rule connecting\nthe bulk stress to a rank-2 microstructural fabric tensor Q and a closed\ntime-evolution equation for Q. In dense suspensions most of the stress comes\nfrom short-ranged pairwise steric or lubrication interactions at near-contacts,\nso a natural choice for Q is the deviatoric 2nd moment of the distribution P(p)\nof the near-contact orientations p. Here we test directly whether a closed\ntime-evolution equation for such a Q can exist for inertialess non-Brownian\nhard spheres in a Newtonian solvent. We perform extensive numerical simulations\nfor the evolution of P(p) under shear reversal, providing a stringent test for\nFEMs. We consider a generic class of these as defined by Hand (1962)\nconstrained only by frame indifference. Motivated by the small microstructural\nanisotropy in the dense regime, we start with linear models and successively\nconsider increasingly nonlinear ones. Based on these results we suggest that no\nclosed FEM properly describes the dynamics of Q under reversal. We attribute\nthis to the fact that Q gives a poor description of the microstructure during\nlarge parts of the microstructural evolution following shear reversal.\nSpecifically, the truncation of P(p) at 2nd spherical harmonic level describes\ntwo-lobed distributions of near-contact orientations, whereas on reversal we\nobserve distributions that are markedly four-lobed; moreover dP/dt (p) has\noblique axes, not collinear with those of Q in the shear plane.

Such a scenario\ndescribes photonic many-body systems such as exciton-polariton gases. Our\nanalysis is based on a set of kinetic equations for a gas of noninteracting\nbosons.

At\neach transition a state either becomes or ceases to be Bose selected (i.e. to\nhost a condensate): The state which first acquires a condensate when the\npumping exceeds a threshold is the one with the largest ratio of pumping to\nloss.

By reverting to an older,\nmore heuristic model it is shown that all of the technical difficulties are\neliminated. Application to a Lennard-Jones fluid results in a demonstration of\npower of ftDFT to describe crystallization in a highly inhomogeneous system.\nFirst, we show that droplets attached to a slightly hydrophobic wall\ncrystallize spontaneously upon being quenched.

For a system with three or more phases, a\nsimple analysis based on classical nucleation theory predicts that small\nfluctuations always resemble the phase having the lowest surface tension with\nthe surrounding bulk phase, regardless of the relative chemical potentials of\nthe phases. We also identify the conditions at which a fluctuation may convert\nto a different phase as its size increases, referred to here as a \"fluctuation\nphase transition\" (FPT). We demonstrate these phenonena in simulations of a two\ndimensional lattice model by evaluating the free energy surface that describes\nthe thermodynamic properties of a fluctuation as a function of its size and\nphase composition. We show that a FPT can occur in the fluctuations of either a\nstable or metastable bulk phase and that the transition is first-order. We also\nfind that the FPT is bracketed by well-defined spinodals, which place limits on\nthe size of fluctuations of distinct phases. Furthermore, when the FPT occurs\nin a metastable bulk phase, we show that the superposition of the FPT on the\nnucleation process results in two-step nucleation (TSN). We identify distinct\nregimes of TSN based on the nucleation pathway in the free energy surface, and\ncorrelate these regimes to the phase diagram of the bulk system.

The same chemicals involved in the\nself-propulsion mechanism also act on other microswimmers and bias their\nswimming direction towards (or away from) the producing microswimmer. Synthetic\nmicroswimmers therefore provide a synthetic analogue to chemotactic motile\nmicroorganisms.

The Hall angle\nis maximized when a resonance occurs between the frequency of the chiral disks\nand the motion of the probe particle. As the density of the chiral fluid\nincreases, the Hall angle gradually decreases before reaching zero when the\nsystem enters a jammed state.

The problem involves the motion of a\nchain molecule of $N$ segments across a region where the free energy per\nsegment is higher, so that it has to cross a barrier. We consider the limit\nwhere the length of the molecule is much larger than the width of the barrier.\nThe width is taken to be sufficiently wide that a coninuum description is\napplicable to even to the portion over the barrier. We use the Rouse model and\nanalyze the mechanism of crossing a barrier. There can be two dominant\nmechanisms. They are: end crossing and hairpin crossing. We find the free\nenergy of activation for the hairpin crossing is two times that for end\ncrossing. In both cases, the activation energy has a square root dependence on\nthe temperature $T$, leading to a non-Arrhenius form for the rate. We also show\nthat there is a special time dependent solution of the model, which corresponds\nto a kink in the chain, confined to the region of the barrier. The movement of\nthe polymer from one side to the other is equivalent to the motion of the kink\non the chain in the reverse direction.

Applying a transverse force\nto the driven particle can result in either increased or decreased drag in the\ndriving direction, depending on the angle of the drive. The dynamical locking\nproduces anomalies in both the longitudinal and the transverse velocity vs\ndriving force curves, including steps and regimes of negative differential\nresistance.

Without stretching force, the chain is wrapped around the core.\nBy applying an external stretching force, unwrapping of the complex is induced.\nWe study the statics and the dynamics of the unwrapping process by computer\nsimulation and simple phenomenological theory.

The sphere-chain\ncomplex is disordered, i.e. there is no clear winding of the chain around the\nsphere.

This means that in general, for a given degree of\ninelasticity, the complete nonlinear dependence of the transport coefficients\non the shear rate requires the analysis of the {\\em unsteady} hydrodynamic\nbehavior. To simplify the analysis, the steady state conditions have been\nconsidered here in order to perform a linear stability analysis of the\nhydrodynamic equations with respect to the uniform shear flow state.

There are\ntwo ways to approach this question. The first is dynamic: the coupling of a\nlarge object to its environment cause any entanglement to decrease\nconsiderably. The second approach, which is discussed in this paper, puts the\nstress on the difficulty to observe a large scale entanglement. As the number\nof particles n grows we need an ever more precise knowledge of the state, and\nan ever more carefully designed experiment, in order to recognize entanglement.\nTo develop this point we consider a family of observables, called witnesses,\nwhich are designed to detect entanglement. A witness W distinguishes all the\nseparable (unentangled) states from some entangled states. If we normalize the\nwitness W to satisfy |tr(W\\rho)| \\leq 1 for all separable states \\rho, then the\nefficiency of W depends on the size of its maximal eigenvalue in absolute\nvalue; that is, its operator norm ||W||. It is known that there are witnesses\non the space of n qbits for which ||W|| is exponential in n. However, we\nconjecture that for a large majority of n-qbit witnesses ||W|| \\leq O(\\sqrt{n\nlogn}). Thus, in a non ideal measurement, which includes errors, the largest\neigenvalue of a typical witness lies below the threshold of detection.

Coarse graining in classical physics is made natural\nby our limited powers of observation and computation. But in the modern quantum\nmechanics of closed systems, some measure of coarse graining is inescapable\nbecause there are no non-trivial, probabilistic, fine-grained descriptions.\nThis essay explores the consequences of that fact. Quantum theory allows for\nvarious coarse-grained descriptions some of which are mutually incompatible.\nFor most purposes, however, we are interested in the small subset of\n``quasiclassical descriptions'' defined by ranges of values of averages over\nsmall volumes of densities of conserved quantities such as energy and momentum\nand approximately conserved quantities such as baryon number.
