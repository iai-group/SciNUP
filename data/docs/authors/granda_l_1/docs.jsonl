Abstract: Modified gravity models are subject to a number of consistency requirements\nwhich restrict the form that the function $F(R)$ can take.

We first verify that CS modified gravity\nleads to a theory with torsion, where this tensor is given by an antisymmetric\nproduct of the Riemann tensor and derivatives of the CS coupling. We then\ncalculate the torsion in the far field of a weakly gravitating source within\nthe parameterized post-Newtonian formalism, and specialize the result to Earth.\nWe find that CS torsion vanishes only if the coupling vanishes, thus\ngenerically leading to a modification of gyroscopic precession, irrespective of\nthe coupling choice. Perhaps most interestingly, we couple fermions to CS\nmodified gravity via the standard Dirac action and find that these further\ncorrect the torsion tensor. Such a correction leads to two new results: (i) a\ngeneric enhancement of CS modified gravity by the Dirac equation and axial\nfermion currents; (ii) a new two-fermion interactions, mediated by an axial\ncurrent and the CS correction. We conclude with a discussion of the\nconsequences of these results in particle detectors and realistic astrophysical\nsystems. \n\n"}

In this limit, the charge, $q$, and total mass, $m$, of the body go to\nzero, and $q/m$ goes to a well defined limit. The Maxwell field\n$F_{ab}(\\lambda)$ is assumed to be the retarded solution associated with\n$J^a(\\lambda)$ plus a homogeneous solution (the \"external field\") that varies\nsmoothly with $\\lambda$.

The first of these is associated with the principle of\ndetailed balance and explains why solutions to General Relativity are typically\nnot recovered in models that preserve this structure. The second of these\noccurs even without detailed balance and is associated with the breaking of\ndiffeomorphism invariance, required for anisotropic scaling in the UV.

Indeed, we use the Stuckelberg trick\nto show that one of these extra modes become strongly coupled as the parameters\napproach their desired infra-red fixed point.

Naturally, the energy density and the spacetime\ncurvature have a delta-like singularity at the apex of the conical defect, but\nthat doesn't give rise to any unphysical situations. Since the conical solution\nimplies the presence of a source, applying reverse enginnering, one can\nidentify the coupling term that is required in the action to account for that\nsource. In that way, a relation is established between the identification\noperation that gives rise to the topological defect and the interaction term in\nthe action that produces it.

At the\ntypical signal amplitudes expected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-wave Observatory (signal-to-noise ratios between 10 and 20), we\nshow that it will in many cases be difficult to distinguish whether the\ncomponents are neutron stars or black holes.

We\npropose an alternative construction of the spacetime manifold which naturally\nenables time anisotropy. We promote the role of curvature: the Ricci scalar R\nat a given point sets the length scales for physical processes - including\ngravity - in the local inertial frames enclosing that point. The manifold is a\npatchwork of local regions; each region is Lorentz invariant and adopts a local\nscale a_R defined as a_R = 1/sqrt|R|. In each local patch, the length scales of\nphysical processes are measured relatively to a_R, and only their dimensionless\nratios partake in the dynamics of physical processes. Time anisotropy arises by\nrequiring that the form - but not necessarily the parameters - of physical laws\nbe unchanged under variations of the local a_R as one moves on the manifold.\nThe time scaling is found to be dt ~ a_R^(3/2) whereas the spatial part scales\nas dx ~ a_R.\n  We show how to conjoin the local patches of the manifold in a way which\nrespects causality and special relativity, as well as the equivalence and\ngeneral covariance principles. All of Einstein's insights are preserved but the\nparameters of physical laws are only valid locally and become functions of the\nprevailing Ricci scalar.

The main claim is that a single mode of the lathe radiation is\nmaximally entangled with the mode inside the horizon and simultaneously with\nthe modes of early Hawking radiation. We argue that this situation never\nhappens during the evolution of a black hole. Quantum mechanics tells us that\nwhile the black hole exists, unitary evolution maximally entangles a late mode\nlocated just outside the horizon with a combination of early radiation and\nblack hole states, instead of either of them separately. One of the reasons for\nthis is that the black hole radiation is not random and strongly depends on the\ngeometry and charge of the black hole, as detailed numerical calculations of\nHawking evaporation clearly show. As a consequence, one can't factor out the\nstate of the black hole. However, this extended entanglement between the black\nhole and modes of early and late radiation indicates that, as the black hole\nages, the local Rindler horizon is modified out to macroscopic distances from\nthe black hole. Fundamentally non-local physics nor firewalls are not necessary\nto explain this result. We propose an infrared mechanism called {\\it icezone}\nthat is mediated by low energy interacting modes and acts near any event\nhorizon to entangle states separated by long distances. These interactions at\nfirst provide small corrections to the thermal Hawking radiation. At the end of\nevaporation however the effect of interactions is as large as the Hawking\nradiation and information is recovered for an outside observer.

Our framework adheres to the standard rules of quantum\nmechanics and incorporates the quantum fluctuations of the collapsing shell\nspacetime in Hawking's original calculation, while accounting for back-reaction\neffects. We argue that the negative-energy Hawking modes need to be regularly\nintegrated out; and so these are effectively subsumed by the BH and, as a\nresult, the number of coherent negative-energy modes $N_{coh}$ at any given\ntime is parametrically smaller than the total number of the Hawking particles\n$N_{total}$ emitted during the lifetime of the BH. We find that $N_{coh}$ is\ndetermined by the width of the BH wavefunction and scales as the square root of\nthe BH entropy. We also find that the coherent negative-energy modes are\nstrongly entangled with their positive-energy partners. Previously, we have\nfound that $N_{coh}$ is also the number of coherent outgoing particles and that\ninformation can be continually transferred to the outgoing radiation at a rate\nset by $N_{coh}$.

(2) This result, in turn, shows that all static spacetimes\nmaintain holographic equipartition; in these spacetimes, the number of degrees\nof freedom in the boundary is equal to the number of degrees of freedom in the\nbulk. (3) In a general, evolving spacetime, the rate of change of gravitational\nmomentum is related to the difference between the number of bulk and boundary\ndegrees of freedom.

The power and energy of the particle emission behave in two distinct\nways depending on a parameter in the model.

As we demonstrate,\nthe effects of a Type IV singularity appear in the Hubble flow parameters,\nwhich determine the dynamical evolution of the cosmological system. So we study\nvarious inflation models incorporating a Type IV singularity, with the\nsingularity occurring at the end of inflation. Particularly we study a toy\nmodel and a singular version of the $R^2$ gravity Hubble rate. As we evince,\nsome of the Hubble flow parameters become singular at the singularity, an\neffect which indicates that at that point a dynamical instability occurs. This\ndynamical instability eventually indicates the graceful exit from inflation. We\ndemonstrate that the toy model has an unstable de Sitter point at the\nsingularity, so indeed graceful exit could be triggered.

In the decade that followed a\nsignificant number of groups explored intriguing mathematical and physical\nproperties of the new construct.

The equations of motion in the bulk is solved using a low energy\nexpansion method. This allows us, through the junction conditions, to deduce\nthe effective equations of motion for the gravity on the brane. It is shown\nthat the gravity on the brane world is described by a quasi-scalar-tensor\ntheory with a specific coupling function omega(Psi) = 3 Psi / 2(1-Psi) on the\npositive tension brane and omega(Phi) = -3 Phi / 2(1+Phi) on the negative\ntension brane, where Psi and Phi are non-linear realizations of the radion on\nthe positive and negative tension branes, respectively. In contrast to the\nusual scalar-tensor gravity, the quasi-scalar-tensor gravity couples with two\nkinds of matter, namely, the matters on both positive and negative tension\nbranes, with different effective gravitational coupling constants. In\nparticular, the radion disguised as the scalar fields Psi and Phi couples with\nthe sum of the traces of the energy momentum tensor on both branes.

{"id": "hep-th/0312117", "contents": "Title: Massive Gravity on a Brane Abstract: At present no theory of a massive graviton is known that is consistent with\nexperiments at both long and short distances. The problem is that consistency\nwith long distance experiments requires the graviton mass to be very small.\nSuch a small graviton mass however implies an ultraviolet cutoff for the theory\nat length scales far larger than the millimeter scale at which gravity has\nalready been measured. In this paper we attempt to construct a model which\navoids this problem. We consider a brane world setup in warped AdS spacetime\nand we investigate the consequences of writing a mass term for the graviton on\na the infrared brane where the local cutoff is of order a large (galactic)\ndistance scale. The advantage of this setup is that the low cutoff for physics\non the infrared brane does not significantly affect the predictivity of the\ntheory for observers localized on the ultraviolet brane. For such observers the\npredictions of this theory agree with general relativity at distances smaller\nthan the infrared scale but go over to those of a theory of massive gravity at\nlonger distances. A careful analysis of the graviton two-point function,\nhowever, reveals the presence of a ghost in the low energy spectrum. A mode\ndecomposition of the higher dimensional theory reveals that the ghost\ncorresponds to the radion field. We also investigate the theory with a brane\nlocalized mass for the graviton on the ultraviolet brane, and show that the\nphysics of this case is similar to that of a conventional four dimensional\ntheory with a massive graviton, but with one important difference: when the\ninfrared brane decouples and the would-be massive graviton gets heavier than\nthe regular Kaluza--Klein modes, it becomes unstable and it has a finite width\nto decay off the brane into the continuum of Kaluza-Klein states. \n\n"}

We use this fact in this paper to derive in arbitrary\ndimension relations between the topology of the timelike boundary-at-infinity,\n$\\scri$, and that of the spacetime interior to this boundary. We prove as a\nsimple corollary of topological censorship that any asymptotically anti-de\nSitter spacetime with a disconnected boundary-at-infinity necessarily contains\nblack hole horizons which screen the boundary components from each other. This\ncorollary may be viewed as a Lorentzian analog of the Witten and Yau result\nhep-th/9910245, but is independent of the scalar curvature of $\\scri$.\nFurthermore, the topology of V', the Cauchy surface (as defined for\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime with boundary-at-infinity) for regions\nexterior to event horizons, is constrained by that of $\\scri$. In this paper,\nwe prove a generalization of the homology results in gr-qc/9902061 in arbitrary\ndimension, that H_{n-1}(V;Z)=Z^k where V is the closure of V' and k is the\nnumber of boundaries $\\Sigma_i$ interior to $\\Sigma_0$. As a consequence, V\ndoes not contain any wormholes or other compact, non-simply connected\ntopological structures. Finally, for the case of n=2, we show that these\nconstraints and the onto homomorphism of the fundamental groups from which they\nfollow are sufficient to limit the topology of interior of V to either B^2 or\n$I\\times S^1$. \n\n"}
