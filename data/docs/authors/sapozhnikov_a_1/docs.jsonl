Classical Monte Carlo simulations do, however, not suffer from\nthis divergence behavior of Euler's method because this divergence behavior\nhappens on rare events. Indeed, for such nonlinear SDEs the classical Monte\nCarlo Euler method has been shown to converge by exploiting that the Euler\napproximations diverge only on events whose probabilities decay to zero very\nrapidly. Significantly more efficient than the classical Monte Carlo Euler\nmethod is the recently introduced multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method. The main\nobservation of this article is that this multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method\ndoes - in contrast to classical Monte Carlo methods - not converge in general\nin the case of such nonlinear SDEs.

This new model allows considerable flexibility in the design of\ndistribution testing algorithms; in particular, testing algorithms in this\nmodel can be adaptive.\n  We study a wide range of natural distribution testing problems in this new\nframework and some of its variants, giving both upper and lower bounds on query\ncomplexity. These problems include testing whether $D$ is the uniform\ndistribution $\\mathcal{U}$; testing whether $D = D^\\ast$ for an explicitly\nprovided $D^\\ast$; testing whether two unknown distributions $D_1$ and $D_2$\nare equivalent; and estimating the variation distance between $D$ and the\nuniform distribution.

In particular, in \\cite{DKBB} the possibility to\nuse of the projection postulate and representation of \"mental observables\" by\nHermitian operators was discussed in very detail. The main conclusion of the\nrecent discussions on the foundations of \"quantum(-like) cognitive psychology\"\nis that one has to be careful in determination of conditions of applicability\nof the projection postulate as a mathematical tool for description of\nmeasurements of observables represented by Hermitian operators. To represent\nsome statistical experimental data (both physical and mental) in the\nquantum(-like) way, one has to use generalized quantum observables given by\npositive operator-valued measures (POVMs).

In the literature the relaxation process for the above\nmodels has been assumed to be quasi-one dimensional and, in particular, their\nequilibration time has been computed using the relaxation time of the East\nmodel ($d=1$) on the equilibrium length scale $L_c=(1/c)^{1/d}$ in\n$d$-dimension.

Whenever the clock of a vertex $x$ rings, it calls a random\nneighbour $y$: if $x$ knows the rumour and $y$ does not, then $x$ tells $y$ the\nrumour (a push operation), and if $x$ does not know the rumour and $y$ knows\nit, $y$ tells $x$ the rumour (a pull operation). The average spread time of $G$\nis the expected time it takes for all vertices to know the rumour, and the\nguaranteed spread time of $G$ is the smallest time $t$ such that with\nprobability at least $1-1/n$, after time $t$ all vertices know the rumour. The\nsynchronous variant of this protocol, in which each clock rings precisely at\ntimes $1,2,\\dots$, has been studied extensively. We prove the following results\nfor any $n$-vertex graph: In either version, the average spread time is at most\nlinear even if only the pull operation is used, and the guaranteed spread time\nis within a logarithmic factor of the average spread time, so it is $O(n\\log\nn)$.

In particular, Canonne, Ron, and Servedio\n(SICOMP 2015) showed that, in this setting, testing identity of an unknown\ndistribution $D$ (whether $D=D^\\ast$ for an explicitly known $D^\\ast$) can be\ndone with a constant number of queries, independent of the support size $n$ --\nin contrast to the required $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ in the standard sampling model.\nIt was unclear whether the same stark contrast exists for the case of testing\nequivalence, where both distributions are unknown.

In addition to simulating quantum systems, SQA has also been\nproposed as another physics-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial\noptimization, alongside classical simulated annealing. However, in many cases\nit remains an open challenge to determine the performance of both QA and SQA.\nOne piece of evidence for the strength of QA over classical simulated annealing\ncomes from an example by Farhi, Goldstone and Gutmann . There a bit-symmetric\ncost function with a thin, high energy barrier was designed to show an\nexponential seperation between classical simulated annealing, for which thermal\nfluctuations take exponential time to climb the barrier, and quantum annealing\nwhich passes through the barrier and reaches the global minimum in poly time,\narguably by taking advantage of quantum tunneling.

By applying the paracontrolled calculus introduced by\nGubinelli et al.

In particular, if the coupling constants of the nonlinear term\nof the coupled KPZ equation satisfy the so-called \"trilinear\" condition, the\nrenormalization factors can be taken the same in two approximations and the\ndifference of the limits of two approximations are explicitly computed.\nMoreover, under the trilinear condition, the Wiener measure twisted by the\ndiffusion matrix becomes stationary for the limit and we show that the solution\nof the limit equation exists globally in time when the initial value is sampled\nfrom the stationary measure.

It may be summarised by an exponent\ntriple $(1/2,1/3,2/3)$ representing local interface fluctuation, local\nroughness (or inward deviation) and convex hull facet length. The three effects\narise, for example, in droplets in planar Ising models (Alexander, '01,\nHammond, '11,'12). In this article, we offer a new perspective on this\nphenomenon. We consider directed last passage percolation model in the plane, a\nparadigmatic example in the KPZ universality class, and constrain the\nmaximizing path under the additional requirement of enclosing an atypically\nlarge area. The interface suffers a constraint of parabolic curvature as\nbefore, but now its local structure is the KPZ fixed point polymer's rather\nthan Brownian.

The second relation applies to the tripartite memory scenario. It\ndetermines the minimum of the sum of the Wehrl entropy of a quantum state\nconditioned on the first memory quantum system with the Wehrl entropy of the\nsame state conditioned on the second memory quantum system and proves that also\nthis minimum is asymptotically achieved by a suitable sequence of quantum\nGaussian states.

Random matrix theory plays a central role\nin statistical physics, computational mathematics and engineering sciences,\nincluding data assimilation, signal processing, combinatorial optimization,\ncompressed sensing, econometrics and mathematical finance, among numerous\nothers. The mathematical foundations of the theory of random matrices lies at\nthe intersection of combinatorics, non-commutative algebra, geometry,\nmultivariate functional and spectral analysis, and of course statistics and\nprobability theory.

These diffusions\nrepresent the distances-to-default of financial institutions and absorption at\nzero corresponds to default. As a way of modelling correlated exposures and\nherd behaviour, we consider a common source of noise and a form of\nmean-reversion in the drift. Moreover, we introduce an endogenous contagion\nmechanism whereby the default of one institution can cause a drop in the\ndistances-to-default of the other institutions.

While there are\nalgorithms with provable guarantees for learning undirected graphical models in\na variety of settings, there has been much less progress in the important\nscenario when there are latent variables. Here we study Restricted Boltzmann\nMachines (or RBMs), which are a popular model with wide-ranging applications in\ndimensionality reduction, collaborative filtering, topic modeling, feature\nextraction and deep learning.\n  The main message of our paper is a strong dichotomy in the feasibility of\nlearning RBMs, depending on the nature of the interactions between variables:\nferromagnetic models can be learned efficiently, while general models cannot.\nIn particular, we give a simple greedy algorithm based on influence\nmaximization to learn ferromagnetic RBMs with bounded degree. In fact, we learn\na description of the distribution on the observed variables as a Markov Random\nField. Our analysis is based on tools from mathematical physics that were\ndeveloped to show the concavity of magnetization. Our algorithm extends\nstraighforwardly to general ferromagnetic Ising models with latent variables.\n  Conversely, we show that even for a contant number of latent variables with\nconstant degree, without ferromagneticity the problem is as hard as sparse\nparity with noise. This hardness result is based on a sharp and surprising\ncharacterization of the representational power of bounded degree RBMs: the\ndistribution on their observed variables can simulate any bounded order MRF.\nThis result is of independent interest since RBMs are the building blocks of\ndeep belief networks. \n\n"}

Here this approach is used in concert with tools from large\ndeviation theory (LDT) and optimal control to estimate the probability that\nsome observables in a dynamical system go above a large threshold after some\ntime, given the prior statistical information about the system's parameters\nand/or its initial conditions.

Our study includes exploration of the process itself as well\nas connections to well-known stochastic models such as branching processes,\nrandom walks, epidemics, preferential attachment, and Bayesian mixture models.\nFurthermore, we prove a batch scaling construction of general, marked Hawkes\nprocesses from a general ephemerally self-exciting model, and this novel limit\ntheorem both provides insight into the Hawkes process and motivates the model\ncontained herein as an attractive self-exciting process in its own right. \n\n"}

Four different weights are given to the loops, depending on their\nhomotopy class and whether they touch the outer rim of the annulus.

We classify the conformal boundary conditions and give exact\nexpressions for the corresponding boundary scaling dimensions. The amplitudes\nwith which the sectors with any prescribed number and types of non contractible\nloops appear in the full partition function Z are computed rigorously.
