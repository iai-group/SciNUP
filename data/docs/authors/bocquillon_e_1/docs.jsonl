The superconducting barriers\nare assumed to be reflection-less so that an incident electron on the barrier\ncan either tunnel through it or Andreev reflect from it. In this structure,\nquantum charge pumping can be achieved (a) by modulating the amplitudes,\n$\\Delta_1$ and $\\Delta_2$ of the two superconducting gaps or alternatively, (b)\nby a periodic modulation of the order parameter phases, $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$\nof the superconducting barriers. In the former case, we show that the\nsuperconducting gap gives rise to a very sharp resonance in the transmission\nresulting in quantization of pumped charge, when the pumping contour encloses\nthe resonance. On the other hand, we find that quantization is hard to achieve\nin the latter case. We show that inclusion of weak electron-electron\ninteraction in the quantum wire leads to renormalisation group evolution of the\ntransmission amplitude towards the perfectly transmitting limit due to\nproximity effects. Hence as we approach the zero temperature limit, we get\ndestruction of quantized pumped charge.

Under special circumstances, a\nsubspace of the system's Hilbert space remains coherent, or \"decoherence free\",\nand the reduced density matrix approaches a non-trivial limit which contains\ninformation on its initial quantum state, despite the coupling to the\nenvironment. This situation is called \"partial decoherence\". Here we find the\nconditions for partial decoherence for a mesoscopic system (with $N$ quantum\nstates) which is coupled to an environment. When the Hamiltonian of the system\ncommutes with the total Hamiltonian, one has \"adiabatic decoherence\", which\nyields N-1 time-independent combinations of the reduced density matrix\nelements.

If the system undergoes a second measurement, the statistics of the\nfirst output can be conditioned on the value of the second one. This procedure\nis known as postselection. A postselected weak measurement of an observable can\ngive a large average output of the probe when the postselected state is nearly\northogonal to the initial state of the system. This large value is an\ninterference effect in the readout of the probe, which is initially in a\ncoherent superposition of readout states (also known as pointer states).\nUsually, the weak interaction between system and probe is considered\ninstantaneous, so that the dynamics of the probe can be neglected.

Recently, substantial progress was achieved in enhancing the\ntime within which a solid-state qubit demonstrates coherent dynamics. This\nprogress is based mostly on a successful isolation of the qubits from external\ndecoherence sources obtained by clever engineering. Under these conditions, the\nmaterial-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial role. In most cases,\nquantum devices are affected by noise decreasing with frequency, f,\napproximately as 1/f. According to the present point of view, such noise is due\nto material- and device-specific microscopic degrees of freedom interacting\nwith quantum variables of the nanodevice. The simplest picture is that the\nenvironment that destroys the phase coherence of the device can be thought of\nas a system of two-state fluctuators, which experience random hops between\ntheir states. If the hopping times are distributed in a exponentially broad\ndomain, the resulting fluctuations have a spectrum close to 1/f in a large\nfrequency range. In this paper we review the current state of the theory of\ndecoherence due to degrees of freedom producing 1/f noise.

Solutions allowing for reconstruction of spectral density of\nnoise are given.

Using\ngroup-theoretical methods, we derive an invariant expansion of the Hamiltonian\nfor electron states near the K point of the Brillouin zone. In contrast to\nknown materials, including single-layer graphene, any possible coupling of\nphysical quantities to components of the external electric (magnetic) field has\na counterpart where the analogous component of the magnetic (electric) field\ncouples to exactly the same combination of quantities. For example, a purely\nelectric spin splitting appears as the magneto-electric analogue of the\nfamiliar magnetic Zeeman spin splitting. The measurable thermodynamic response\ninduced by magnetic and electric fields is thus completely symmetric. The Pauli\nmagnetization induced by a magnetic field takes exactly the same functional\nform as the polarization induced by an electric field. Our findings thus reveal\nunconventional behavior of spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom in their\ncoupling to external fields.

To this end, we\ndefine a circuit-based model of computation in a class of operationally-defined\ntheories more general than quantum theory, and ask: what is the minimal set of\nphysical assumptions under which the above inclusion still holds? We show that\ngiven only an assumption of tomographic locality (roughly, that multipartite\nstates can be characterised by local measurements), efficient computations are\ncontained in AWPP. This inclusion still holds even without assuming a basic\nnotion of causality (where the notion is, roughly, that probabilities for\noutcomes cannot depend on future measurement choices). Following Aaronson, we\nextend the computational model by allowing post-selection on measurement\noutcomes. Aaronson showed that the corresponding quantum complexity class is\nequal to PP. Given only the assumption of tomographic locality, the inclusion\nin PP still holds for post-selected computation in general theories.

The post-quench Cooper pairs occupy a linear combination\nof \"ground\" and \"excited\" Floquet states, with coefficients determined by the\ndistribution function. While the Floquet bandstructure exhibits a single\navoided crossing relative to the equilibrium case, the distribution function\nshows a population inversion of the Floquet bands at low energies. For a\nrealization in ultracold atoms, these two features compensate, producing a bulk\naverage rf signal that is well-captured by a quasi-equilibrium approximation.\nIn particular, the rf spectrum shows a robust gap. The single crossing occurs\nbecause the quench-induced Floquet phase belongs to a particular class of\nsoliton dynamics for the BCS equation. The population inversion is a\nconsequence of this, and ensures the conservation of the pseudospin winding\nnumber.

Several recent studies have focused on structures\nwhere such conventional $s$-wave superconductors are coupled to systems with an\nunusual configuration of electronic spin and momentum at the Fermi surface.\nUnder these conditions, the nature of the paired state can be modified and the\nsystem may even undergo a topological phase transition [2, 3]. Here we present\nmeasurements and theoretical calculations of several HgTe quantum wells coupled\nto either aluminum or niobium superconductors and subject to a magnetic field\nin the plane of the quantum well. By studying the oscillatory response of\nJosephson interference to the magnitude of the in-plane magnetic field, we find\nthat the induced pairing within the quantum well is spatially varying. Cooper\npairs acquire a tunable momentum that grows with magnetic field strength,\ndirectly reflecting the response of the spin-dependent Fermi surfaces to the\nin-plane magnetic field. In addition, in the regime of high electron density,\nnodes in the induced superconductivity evolve with the electron density in\nagreement with our model based on the Hamiltonian of Bernevig, Hughes, and\nZhang [4]. This agreement allows us to quantitatively extract the value of\n$\\tilde{g}/v_{F}$, where $\\tilde{g}$ is the effective g-factor and $v_{F}$ is\nthe Fermi velocity.

We do this by first\nconstructing a holographic $c$-function using causal horizon in the black brane\ngeometry. The UV value of the $c$-function is $a_{UV}$ and then it decreases\nmonotonically to zero at the curvature singularity. Intuitively, the behavior\nof the $c$-function can be understood if we recognize that the dual CFT is in a\nthermal state and thermal states are effectively massive with a gap set by the\ntemperature. In field theory, logarithmic entanglement negativity is an\nentanglement measure for mixed states. For example, in two dimensional CFTs on\ninfinite line at finite temperature, the renormalized entanglement negativity\nof an interval has UV (Low- T) value $c_{UV}$ and IR (High-T) value zero. So\nthis is a potential candidate for our $c$-function. In four dimensions we\nexpect the same thing to hold on physical grounds. Now since the causal horizon\ngoes behind the black brane horizon the holographic $c$-function is sensitive\nto the physics of the interior. Correspondingly the field theory $c$-function\nshould also contain information about the interior. So our results suggest that\nhigh temperature (IR) expansion of the negativity (or any candidate\n$c$-function) may be a way to probe part of the physics near the singularity.\nNegativity at finite temperature depends on the full operator content of the\ntheory and so perhaps this can be be done in specific cases only.\n  The existence of this $c$-function in the bulk is an extreme example of the\nparadigm that space-time is built out of entanglement. In particular the fact\nthat the $c$-function reaches zero at the curvature singularity correlates the\ntwo facts : loss of quantum entanglement in the IR field theory and the end of\ngeometry in the bulk which in this case is the formation of curvature\nsingularity. \n\n"}

The oscillation frequency and time-dependent phase\nshift of the singlet-triplet correlator can be used to perform a precision\nmeasurement of the exchange interaction and Overhauser field fluctuations in an\nexperimentally accessible system. We also address the effect of orbital\ndephasing on singlet-triplet decoherence, and find that there is an optimal\noperating point where orbital dephasing becomes negligible. \n\n"}

Different approaches have been devised to cure this problem for\nsuperconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at\noptimal working points, so-called \"sweet spots.\" This latter approach led to\nsignificant improvement of $T_2$ times in Cooper pair box qubits [D.

Here, we introduce a new type of superconducting\nqubit called the \"transmon.\" Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed\nto operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and\ncharging energy $E_J/E_C$. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge\ndispersion decreases exponentially with $E_J/E_C$, while its loss in\nanharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a\ndrastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair\nbox and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient\nanharmonicity for selective qubit control.

The entanglement is investigated in terms of the\nvon Neumann entropy, S=-Tr rho_A log rho_A, for a sub-system A of size r of the\nchain. The impurity contribution to the uniform part of the entanglement\nentropy, S_{imp}, is defined and analyzed in detail in both the gapless, J_2 <=\nJ_2^c, as well as the dimerized phase, J_2>J_2^c, of the model. This quantum\nimpurity model is in the universality class of the single channel Kondo model\nand it is shown that in a quite universal way the presence of the impurity in\nthe gapless phase, J_2 <= J_2^c, gives rise to a large length scale, xi_K,\nassociated with the screening of the impurity, the size of the Kondo screening\ncloud. The universality of Kondo physics then implies scaling of the form\nS_{imp}(r/xi_K,r/R) for a system of size R. Numerical results are presented\nclearly demonstrating this scaling. At the critical point, J_2^c, an analytic\nFermi liquid picture is developed and analytic results are obtained both at T=0\nand T>0. In the dimerized phase an appealing picure of the entanglement is\ndeveloped in terms of a thin soliton (TS) ansatz and the notions of impurity\nvalence bonds (IVB) and single particle entanglement (SPE) are introduced. The\nTS-ansatz permits a variational calculation of the complete entanglement in the\ndimerized phase that appears to be exact in the thermodynamic limit at the\nMajumdar-Ghosh point, J_2=J_1/2, and surprisingly precise even close to the\ncritical point J_2^c. In appendices the relation between the finite temperature\nentanglement entropy, S(T), and the thermal entropy, S_{th}(T), is discussed\nand <S^z_r> and <S_r S_{r+1}> calculated at the MG-point using the TS-ansatz. \n\n"}

These hidden subgroup problems are then solved\nby Fourier sampling: the quantum Fourier transform of y is computed and\nmeasured.

Here, we present a\ngeneral theory of the decoy state protocol based on only two decoy states and\none signal state. We perform optimization on the choice of intensities of the\ntwo decoy states and the signal state. Our result shows that a decoy state\nprotocol with only two types of decoy states--the vacuum and a weak decoy\nstate--asymptotically approaches the theoretical limit of the most general type\nof decoy state protocols (with an infinite number of decoy states). We also\npresent a one-decoy-state protocol. Moreover, we provide estimations on the\neffects of statistical fluctuations and suggest that, even for long distance\n(larger than 100km) QKD, our two-decoy-state protocol can be implemented with\nonly a few hours of experimental data. In conclusion, decoy state quantum key\ndistribution is highly practical. \n\n"}
