Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

We measured the radial velocity curve from the wings of the\ndouble-peaked H$\\alpha$ emission line, and obtained a semi-amplitude value that\nis in excellent agreement with the obtained from observations in the\nultraviolet spectral region by Sion et al.

This derivative is positive, suggesting a degenerate or fully\nconvective companion star, but is more than one order of magnitude higher than\nwhat is expected from secular evolution driven by angular momentum losses\ncaused by gravitational radiation under the hypothesis of conservative mass\ntransfer. Using simple considerations on the angular momentum of the system, we\npropose an explanation of this puzzling result assuming that during X-ray\nquiescence the source is ejecting matter (and angular momentum) from the inner\nLagrangian point.

The spatial\nresolution of the images allow us to separate the nuclear and the extended\ncontributions to the total emission after decomposing the brightness profiles\ninto different morphological components. The most common components are a\ncentral point source (identified as the active nucleus) and an exponential\ndisk. In some cases a bulge, a bar or a ring are needed. The relative\ncontribution of the nucleus to the total emission appears larger in Seyfert 1\nthan in Seyfert 2. This result confirms that both types of Seyfert galaxies are\ndifferent in the mid-infrared and supports the existence of an structure which\nproduces anisotropic emission in this wavelength range.

NGC1692 and PKS0625-35 have fairly steep\npower-law components, perhaps indicative of synchrotron emission from a jet.\nConversely, the flat photon index derived for 3C88 may be indicative of a\nheavily absorbed object. Finally, the time-averaged spectral properties of\n3C444 (Gamma~1.9 and an apparent line-like excess around 6.7 keV) are more in\nline with Seyfert galaxies. The temporal analysis reveals that PKS0625-35 and\n3C88 are significantly variable in the soft energy band. PKS0625-35 also shows\nsuggestive evidence of spectral variability on timescales of months. The main\nfindings from the broadband analysis can be summarized as follows: 1) 3C444,\nPKS0625-35, and NGC1692 have alpha_OX values consistent with the well known\nalpha_OX -l_UV correlation. 2) No positive correlation is found between L_X and\nthe inclination angle, suggesting that the X-ray emission is not beamed. 3) The\nvalues of the radio-loudness are inversely proportional to the Eddington ratio\nand locate our objects in between the ``radio-loud'' and ``radio-quiet''\nbranches in the R- l_UV plane. \n\n"}

Two thirds of the LIRGs are disk\ngalaxies, with only one third showing some evidence for interactions, minor, or\nmajor mergers. In contrast with local LIRG disks (which are primarily barred\nsystems), only 10% of the LIRG disks in our sample contain a prominent bar.\nWhile the optical bands tend to show significant point-like substructure,\nindicating distributed star formation, the AO K-band images tend to be smooth.\nThe SEDs of the LIRGs are consistent with distributed dusty star formation, as\nexhibited by optical to IR colors redder than allowed by old stellar\npopulations alone. This effect is most pronounced in the galaxy cores, possibly\nindicating central star formation.

Models argue\nthat mergers between more gas-rich (typically lower-mass) disks yield larger\nmass fractions formed in compact starbursts, giving a smaller stellar R_e and\nhigher M_stellar/M_tot within that R_e. Such starbursts leave a characteristic\nimprint in the surface brightness profile: a central excess above an outer\nprofile established by the dissipationless violent relaxation of disk stars. In\nprevious work, we developed empirical methods to decompose the observed\nprofiles of ellipticals and robustly estimate the amount of dissipation in the\noriginal spheroid-forming merger(s). Applying this to a large sample of\nobserved ellipticals, we test whether or not their location on the FP and its\ntilt are driven by dissipation. At fixed mass, ellipticals formed in more\ndissipational events are smaller and have higher M_stellar/M_tot. At fixed\ndegree of dissipation, there is no tilt in the FP. We show that the dynamical\nmass estimator R_e*sigma^2/G is a good estimator of the true mass: the observed\nFP tilt cannot primarily owe to other forms of non-homology. Removing the\neffects of dissipation, observed ellipticals obey the same FP correlations as\ndisks: unusual progenitors are not required to make typical ellipticals.\nDissipation appears to be both necessary and sufficient to explain the FP tilt. \n\n"}

Abstract: Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) are stellar systems with masses of around\n10^7 to 10^8 Msun and half mass radii of 10-100 pc. They have some properties\nin common with massive globular clusters, however dynamical mass estimates have\nshown that UCDs have mass-to-light ratios which are on average about twice as\nlarge than those of globular clusters at comparable metallicity, and tend to be\nlarger than what one would expect for old stellar systems with standard mass\nfunctions.\n  One possible explanation for elevated high mass-to-light ratios in UCDs is\nthe existence of a substantial amount of dark matter, which could have ended up\nin UCDs if they are the remnant nuclei of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies.\nTidal stripping of dwarf galaxies has also been suggested has the origin of\nseveral massive globular clusters like Omega Cen, in which case globular\nclusters could have also formed with substantial amounts of dark matter.\n  In this paper, we present collisional N-body simulations which study the\nco-evolution of a system composed out of stars and dark matter. We find that\nthe dark matter gets removed from the central regions of such systems due to\ndynamical friction and mass segregation of stars. The friction timescale is\nsignificantly shorter than a Hubble time for typical globular clusters, while\nmost UCDs have friction times much longer than a Hubble time. Therefore, a\nsignificant dark matter fraction remains within the half-mass radius of\npresent-day UCDs, making dark matter a viable explanation for the elevated M/L\nratios of UCDs. If at least some globular clusters formed in a way similar to\nUCDs, we predict a substantial amount of dark matter in their outer parts. \n\n"}

We\ninvestigate the accretion luminosity during several such flashes, including the\nfirst-ever and brightest detected flash from Cen X-4 in 1969. We infer from\nobservations and theory that immediately prior to these flashes the accretion\nrate must have been between about 0.001 and 0.01 times the equivalent of the\nEddington limit, which is roughly 2 orders of magnitude less than the peak\naccretion rates seen in these transients during an X-ray outburst and 3-4\norders of magnitude more than the lowest measured values in quiescence.\nFurthermore, three such flashes, including the one from Cen X-4, occurred\nwithin 2 to 7 days followed by an X-ray outburst.

We first model the individual\nabsorption edges of the elements Ne and Mg in the high resolution X-ray\nspectrum obtained with XMM-Newton.

Finally, we analyze time-resolved X-ray spectra of Type-I\nX-ray bursts observed from this source to measure the mass and the radius of\nthe neutron star. We find a mass of M = 1.74 +/- 0.14 M_sun and a radius of R =\n9.3 +/- 1.0 km, respectively. This mass and radius can be achieved by several\nmulti-nucleon equations of state. \n\n"}

Since thermal emission from dust\ngrains dominates the spectral energy distribution at the sub-mm/FIR regime,\ndust grains are thought to be the cause of the polarization.

The most plausible interpretation is a\nnebula somehow powered by the pulsar, although the small number of counts\nprevents a conclusive answer on the nature of this emission. RRAT J1819-1458's\nspin-down energy loss rate (Edot~3x10^{32} erg/s) is much lower than that of\nother pulsars with observed spin-down powered pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), and\nimplies a rather high X-ray efficiency of eta_{X} = L_(pwn; 0.5-8keV)/Edot~0.2\nat converting spin-down power into the PWN X-ray emission.

This scenario was developed to replace and extend the\nso-called standard cooling scenario to include neutrino emission from the\nCooper pair breaking and formation processes that occur near the critical\ntemperature for superfluid/superconductor pairing.\n  Recently, it has been found that Cooper-pair neutrino emission from the\nvector channel is suppressed by a large factor compared to the original\nestimates that violated vector current conservation. We show that Cooper-pair\nneutrino emission remains, nevertheless, an efficient cooling mechanism through\nthe axial channel. As a result, the elimination of neutrino emission from\nCooper-paired nucleons through the vector channel has only minor effects on the\nlong-term cooling of neutron stars within the minimal cooling paradigm. We\nfurther quantify precisely the effect of the size of the neutron 3P2 gap and\ndemonstrate that consistency between observations and the minimal cooling\nparadigm requires that the critical temperature T_c for this gap covers a range\nof values between T_c^min < 0.2 x 10^9 K up to T_c^max > 0.5 \\times 10^9 K in\nthe core of the star. In addition, it is required that young neutron stars have\nheterogenous envelope compositions: some must have light-element compositions\nand others must have heavy-element compositions. Unless these two conditions\nare fulfilled, about half of the observed young cooling neutron stars are\ninconsistent with the minimal cooling paradigm and provide evidence for the\nexistence of enhanced cooling. \n\n"}

Of the 10 sources, 4 are Z sources, 4 are atolls and 2 are accreting\nmillisecond X-ray pulsars (also atolls). The Fe K lines are well fit by a\nrelativistic line model for a Schwarzschild metric, and imply a narrow range of\ninner disk radii (6 - 15 GM/c^2) in most cases.

In this paper we revisit the question of\ngamma-ray light-curve formation in pulsars in order to ascertain the robustness\nof the \"two-pole caustic\" (TPC) and \"outer gap\" (OG) models based on the vacuum\nmagnetic field. We point out an inconsistency in the literature on the use of\nthe relativistic aberration formula, where in several works the vacuum field\nwas treated as known in the instantaneously corotating frame, rather than in\nthe laboratory frame. With the corrected formula, we find that the peaks in the\nlight curves predicted from the TPC model using the vacuum field are less\nsharp. The sharpness of the peaks in the OG model is less affected by this\nchange, but the range of magnetic inclination angles and viewing geometries\nresulting in double-peaked light curves is reduced. In a realistic\nmagnetosphere, the modification of field structure near the light cylinder due\nto plasma effects may change the shape of the polar cap and the location of the\nemission zones. We study the sensitivity of the light curves to different\nshapes of the polar cap for static and retarded vacuum dipole fields. In\nparticular, we consider polar caps traced by the last open field lines and\ncompare them to circular polar caps. We find that the TPC model is very\nsensitive to the shape of the polar cap, and a circular polar cap can lead to\nfour peaks of emission. The OG model is less affected by polar cap shapes, but\nis subject to big uncertainties of applying the vacuum field near the light\ncylinder. We conclude that deviations from vacuum field can lead to large\nuncertainties in the pulse shapes, and a more realistic force-free field should\nbe applied to the study of pulsar high energy emission. \n\n"}

Starting from observed SMF for\nstar-forming galaxies, we use backwards models to predict the evolution of a\nnumber of quantities, such as the SFR function, the cosmic SFR density and the\nVelocity Function. The velocity being a parameter attached to a galaxy during\nits history (contrary to the stellar mass), this approach allows us to quantify\nthe number density evolution of galaxies of a given velocity, e.g. of the Milky\nWay siblings. Observations suggest that the SMF of star forming galaxies is\nconstant between redshift 0 and 1. In order to reproduce this result, we must\nquench star formation in a number of star forming galaxies. The SMF of these\nquenched galaxies is consistent with available data concerning the increase in\nthe population of quiescent galaxies in the same redshift interval. The SMF of\nquiescent galaxies is then mainly determined by the distribution of active\ngalaxies that must stop star formation, with a modest mass redistribution\nduring mergers. The cosmic SFR density, and the evolution of the SFR functions\nare relatively well recovered, although they provide some clue for a small\nevolution of the SMF of star forming galaxies at the lowest redshifts. We thus\nconsider that we have obtained in a simple way a relatively consistent picture\nof the evolution of galaxies at intermediate redshifts. We note that if this\npicture is correct, 50 percent of the Milky-Way sisters (galaxies with the same\nvelocity as our Galaxy, i.e. 220 km/s) have quenched their star formation since\nredshift 1 (and an even larger fraction for larger velocities).

The\noscillatory motion is influenced by the strong interaction between the shear\nmodes of the crust and Alfven-like modes in the core. We study the dynamics\nwhich arises through this interaction, and present several new results: (1) We\nshow that global {\\it edge modes} frequently reside near the edges of the core\nAlfven continuum. (2) We compute the magnetar's oscillatory motion for\nrealistic axisymmetric magnetic field configurations and core density profiles,\nbut with a simplified model of the elastic crust. We show that one may\ngenerically get multiple gaps in the Alfven continuum. One obtains discrete\nglobal {\\it gap modes} if the crustal frequencies belong to the gaps. (3) We\nshow that field tangling in the core enhances the role of the core discrete\nAlfven modes and reduces the role of the core Alfven continuum in the overall\noscillatory dynamics of the magnetar. (4) We demonstrate that the system\ndisplays transient and/or drifting QPOs when parts of the spectrum of the core\nAlfven modes contain discrete modes which are densely and regularly spaced in\nfrequency. (5) We show that if the neutrons are coupled into the core Alfven\nmotion, then the post-flare crustal motion is strongly damped and has a very\nweak amplitude. Thus magnetar QPOs give evidence that the proton and neutron\ncomponents in the core are dynamically decoupled and that at least one of them\nis a quantum fluid. (6) We show that it is difficult to identify the\nhigh-frequency 625 Hz QPO as being due to the physical oscillatory mode of the\nmagnetar, if the latter's fluid core consists of the standard\nproton-neutron-electron mixture and is magnetised to the same extent as the\ncrust.

They\ngive also the possibility to constrain gravitational wave emission theories and\nthe equation of state of ultra dense matter.

An open question is whether these accreting pulsars are\nspinning up during an outburst and spinning down in quiescence as predicted by\nthe recycling scenario. Until now it has been very difficult to measure\ntorques, due to the presence of fluctuations in the pulse phases that\ncompromise their measurements with standard coherent timing techniques. By\napplying a new method, I am now able to measure a spin up during an outburst\nand a spin down during quiescence.

Such a short\nquiescent period between outbursts has never been seen before from a neutron\nstar X-ray transient. X-ray pulsations at the 599 Hz spin frequency are\ndetected throughout both outbursts. For the first time, we derive a pulse phase\nmodel that connects two outbursts, providing a long baseline for spin frequency\nmeasurement. Comparison with the frequency measured during the 2004 outburst of\nthis source gives a spin-down during quiescence of -4(1)x10^-15 Hz/s,\napproximately an order of magnitude larger than the long-term spin-down\nobserved in the 401 Hz accretion-powered pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. If this\nspin-down is due to magnetic dipole radiation, it requires a 2x10^8 G field\nstrength, and its high spin-down luminosity may be detectable with the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope. Alternatively, this large spin-down could be produced by\ngravitational wave emission from a fractional mass quadrupole moment of Q/I =\n1x10^{-9}. The rapid succession of the outbursts also provides a unique test of\nmodels for accretion in low-mass X-ray binaries.

Abstract: Several claims have been put forward that an essential fraction of\nlong-duration BATSE gamma-ray bursts should lie at redshifts larger than 5.\nThis point-of-view follows from the natural assumption that fainter objects\nshould, on average, lie at larger redshifts. However, redshifts larger than 5\nare rare for bursts observed by Swift, seemingly contradicting the BATSE\nestimates. The purpose of this article is to clarify this contradiction. We\nderive the cosmological relationships between the observed and emitted\nquantities, and we arrive at a prediction that can be tested on the ensembles\nof bursts with determined redshifts. This analysis is independent on the\nassumed cosmology, on the observational biases, as well as on any gamma-ray\nburst model. Four different samples are studied: 8 BATSE bursts with redshifts,\n13 bursts with derived pseudo-redshifts, 134 Swift bursts with redshifts, and 6\nFermi bursts with redshifts. The controversy can be explained by the fact that\napparently fainter bursts need not, in general, lie at large redshifts. Such a\nbehaviour is possible, when the luminosities (or emitted energies) in a sample\nof bursts increase more than the dimming of the observed values with redshift.\nIn such a case dP(z)/dz > 0 can hold, where P(z) is either the peak-flux or the\nfluence. All four different samples of the long bursts suggest that this is\nreally the case. This also means that the hundreds of faint, long-duration\nBATSE bursts need not lie at high redshifts, and that the observed redshift\ndistribution of long Swift bursts might actually represent the actual\ndistribution. \n\n"}

This makes the method inconsistent, because\nthe MacDonald theory tacitly fixes the rheology by making Q scale as the\ninverse tidal frequency.\n  Spin-orbit coupling can be treated also in an approach called \"the Darwin\ntorque\". While this theory is general enough to accommodate an arbitrary\nfrequency-dependence of Q, this advantage has not yet been exploited in the\nliterature, where Q is assumed constant or is set to scale as inverse tidal\nfrequency, the latter assertion making the Darwin torque equivalent to a\ncorrected version of the MacDonald torque.\n  However neither a constant nor an inverse-frequency Q reflect the properties\nof realistic mantles and crusts, because the actual frequency-dependence is\nmore complex. Hence the necessity to enrich the theory of spin-orbit\ninteraction with the right frequency-dependence. We accomplish this programme\nfor the Darwin-torque-based model near resonances.

The column density in these objects is less than 10^24 cm-2, which\nimplies that the Swift/BAT data allow us to study the \"true\" variability of the\ncentral source. Results: All objects show significant variations, with an\namplitude which is similar to the AGN variability amplitude at energies below\n10 keV. We found evidence for an anti-correlation between variability amplitude\nand black hole mass. The light curves in both bands are well correlated, with\nno significant delays on time scales as short as 2 days. NGC 4151 and NGC 2110\ndo not show spectral variability, but we found a significant anti-correlation\nbetween hardness ratios and source flux in NGC 4388 (and NGC 4945, IC 4329, to\na lesser extent). This \"softer when brighter\" behaviour is similar to what has\nbeen observed at energies below 10 keV, and cannot be explained if the\ncontinuum varies only in flux; the intrinsic shape should also steepen with\nincreasing flux.

Tuning of the\nneutrino Dirac and Majorana superpotential couplings and soft Susy breaking\nparameters is required to enforce flatness of the inflationary potential. In\ncontrast to previous inflection point inflation models the cubic term is\ndominantly derived from superpotential couplings rather than soft A-terms. Thus\nsince $M_{\\nu^c}>>M_{Susy}$ the tuning condition is almost independent of the\nsoft supersymmetry breaking parameters and therefore more stable. The required\nfine tuning is also less stringent than for Minimal SUSY Standard Model (MSSM)\ninflation or Dirac neutrino 'A-term\" inflation scenarios due to the much larger\nvalue of the inflaton mass. Reheating proceeds via `instant preheating' which\nrapidly dumps all the inflaton energy into a MSSM mode radiation bath giving a\nhigh reheat temperature $T_{rh} \\approx M_{\\nu^c}^{3/4}\\, 10^{6}$ GeV $\\sim\n10^{11}- 10^{15} $ GeV.\n  Thus our scenario requires large gravitino mass $> 50 $ TeV to avoid a\ngravitino problem.

Large active\nmagnetic loops around magnetars must be filled with outflowing particles that\ninteract with radiation via resonant scattering and spawn electron-positron\npairs. The outflow energy is processed into copious e+- until the plasma enters\nouter parts of the loop where the magnetic field is reduced below 10^13 G. In\nthe outer zone, photons scattered by the outflow do not convert to e+- pairs\nand the outflow radiates its energy away. The escaping radiation forms a\ndistinct hard X-ray peak in the magnetar spectrum. It has the following\nfeatures: (1) Its luminosity L=10^35-10^36 erg/s can easily exceed the thermal\nluminosity from the magnetar surface.

The model is embedded in an anisotropic type\nIIB compactification with two exponentially large extra dimensions and\nTeV-scale gravity. The bulk turns out to be nearly supersymmetric since the\nscale of the gravitino mass is of the order of the observed value of the\ncosmological constant. The quintessence field is a modulus parameterising the\nsize of an internal four-cycle which naturally develops a potential of the\norder (gravitino mass)^4, leading to a small dark energy scale without tunings.\nThe mass of the quintessence field is also radiatively stable since it is\nprotected by supersymmetry in the bulk. Moreover, this light scalar couples to\nordinary matter via its mixing with the volume mode. Due to the fact that the\nquintessence field is a flat direction at leading order, this mixing is very\nsmall, resulting in a suppressed coupling to Standard Model particles which\navoids stringent fifth-force constraints. On the other hand, if dark matter is\nrealised in terms of Kaluza-Klein states, unsuppressed couplings between dark\nenergy and dark matter can emerge, leading to a scenario of coupled\nquintessence within string theory. We study the dynamics of quintessence in our\nset-up, showing that its main features make it compatible with observations. \n\n"}

Methods: We used the UVES at the VLT to obtain\nhigh-resolution spectra of the programme stars.

Results: All candidates are confirmed to be EMP\nstars, with [Fe/H]<= -3.0. The chemical composition of the sample of stars is\nsimilar to that of brighter and nearer samples. We measured the lithium\nabundance for 12 stars and provide stringent upper limits for three other\nstars, for a fourth star the upper limit is not significant, owing to the low\nsignal-to noise ratio of the spectrum.

Conclusions: The concordance of the metallicities derived from\nhigh-resolution spectra and those estimated from the SDSS spectra suggests that\nthe latter may be used to study the metallicity distribution of the halo. The\nabundance pattern suggests that the halo was well mixed for all probed\nmetallicities and distances.

The oscillations of this object imprint a pronounced peak in\nthe gravitational-wave (GW) spectra, which is used to characterize the emission\nfor a given model. The peak frequency of this postmerger GW signal correlates\nvery well with the radii of nonrotating NSs, and thus allows to constrain the\nhigh-density EoS by a GW detection. In the case of 1.35-1.35 $M_{\\odot}$\nmergers the peak frequency scales particularly well with the radius of a NS\nwith 1.6 $M_{\\odot}$, where the maximum deviation from this correlation is only\n60 meters for fully microphysical EoSs which are compatible with NS\nobservations. Combined with the uncertainty in the determination of the peak\nfrequency it appears likely that a GW detection can measure the radius of a 1.6\n$M_{\\odot}$ NS with an accuracy of about 100 to 200 meters.

Here we focus on a subclass of these events, where the light\ncurve is also tens of days wide, so the total radiated energy is order 10^{51}\nerg. If the origin of these SLSNe is a core-collapse-driven explosion of a\nmassive star, then the mechanism which converts the explosion energy into\nradiation must be very efficient (much more than in typical core collapse SNe,\nwhere this efficiency is of order one percent). We examine the scenario where\nthe radiated luminosity is due to efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the\nejected stellar envelope into radiation by interaction with an optically thick,\npre-existing circumstellar material (CSM), presumably the product of a steady\nwind from the progenitor. We base the analysis on a simple, numerically solved,\nhydrodynamic diffusion model, which allows us to identify the qualitative\nbehavior of the observable light curves, and to relate them to the parameters\nof the wind. We specifically show that a wide and superluminous supernova\nrequires the mass of the relevant wind material to be comparable to that of\nejected material from the exploding progenitor.

In\nthis work, we determine the neutron star mass-radius relation and, based on\nrecent observations of both transiently accreting and bursting sources, we show\nthat the radius of a 1.4 solar mass neutron star lies between 10.4 and 12.9 km,\nindependent of assumptions about the composition of the core.

During this\nphase, the inflaton typically oscillates at the bottom of its potential and\ngradually transfers its energy to radiation. At the same time, the amplitude of\nthe fields coupled to the inflaton may undergo parametric resonance and, as a\nconsequence, explosive particle production can take place. A priori, these\nphenomena could lead to an amplification of the super-Hubble scale curvature\nperturbations which, in turn, would modify the standard inflationary\npredictions. However, remarkably, it has been shown that, although the\nMukhanov-Sasaki variable does undergo narrow parametric instability during\npreheating, the amplitude of the corresponding super-Hubble curvature\nperturbations remain constant. Therefore, in single field models, metric\npreheating does not affect the power spectrum of the large scale perturbations.\nIn this article, we investigate the corresponding effect on the scalar\nbi-spectrum. Using the Maldacena's formalism, we analytically show that, for\nmodes of cosmological interest, the contributions to the scalar bi-spectrum as\nthe curvature perturbations evolve on super-Hubble scales during preheating is\ncompletely negligible. Specifically, we illustrate that, certain terms in the\nthird order action governing the curvature perturbations which may naively be\nexpected to contribute significantly are exactly canceled by other\ncontributions to the bi-spectrum. We corroborate selected analytical results by\nnumerical investigations. We conclude with a brief discussion of the results we\nhave obtained. \n\n"}

The mocks that we\nconstruct are lightcone catalogues, in which a galaxy is placed according to\nthe epoch at which it first enters the past lightcone of the observer, and\nincorporate the evolution of galaxy properties with cosmic time.

As an application, we consider the\neffectiveness of the BzK colour selection technique, which was designed to\nisolate galaxies in the redshift interval 1.4<z<2.5. The mock catalogue is in\nreasonable agreement with the observed number counts of all BzK galaxies, as\nwell as with the observed counts of the subsample of BzKs that are star-forming\ngalaxies. We predict that over 75 per cent of the model galaxies with\nK_{AB}<=23, and 1.4<z<2.5, are selected by the BzK technique. Interloper\ngalaxies, outside the intended redshift range, are predicted to dominate bright\nsamples of BzK galaxies (i.e. with K_{AB}<=21).

Careful reconstruction of the SZ signal indicates that most\nclusters are individually detected at least out to R500. By stacking the radial\nprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial SZ signal out to 3 x R500,\ni.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about the\nmean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.\nOur measurement is fully consistent with previous Planck results on integrated\nSZ fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between SZ and X-ray\nmeasurements inside R500. Correcting for the effects of the Planck beam, we\nhave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. This new constraint from\nSZ measurements is consistent with the X-ray constraints from XMM-Newton in the\nregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]R500), and is in fairly good\nagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion.

However, with only\nthree giant flares ever recorded, and only two with data of sufficient quality\nto search for QPOs, such analysis is seriously data limited. We set out a\nprocedure for doing QPO searches in the far more numerous, short, less\nenergetic magnetar bursts. The short, transient nature of these bursts requires\nthe implementation of sophisticated statistical techniques to make reliable\ninferences. Using Bayesian statistics, we model the periodogram as a\ncombination of red noise at low frequencies and white noise at high\nfrequencies, which we show is a conservative approach to the problem. We use\nempirical models to make inferences about the potential signature of periodic\nand quasi-periodic oscillations at these frequencies.

In\nthis paper, we consider the evolution of primordial binaries upto the stage\nwhere the neutron star just formed in the supernova explosion of the primary is\nin a binary with its low-mass unevolved companion, and this binary has\ncircularized tidally, producing what we call a pre-low-mass X-ray binary\n(pre-LMXB). We study the constraints on the formation of such pre-LMXBs in\ndetail (since these are low probability events), and calculate their collective\nproperties and formation rate. To this end, we first consider the changes in\nthe binary parameters in the various steps involved, viz., the common-envelope\n(CE) phase, the supernova, and the tidal evolution.

In such hybrid natural inflation scenarios (examples are provided by\nWilson line inflation and fluxbrane inflation), the slow-roll parameter\n$\\epsilon$ can be sizable during an early period (relevant for the CMB\nspectrum).

During the accretion stage, the system is\ncalled a low-mass X-ray binary, and bright X-ray emission is observed. When the\nrate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, these\nbinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by the\nneutron star's rotating magnetic field. This evolutionary model is supported by\nthe detection of millisecond X-ray pulsations from several accreting neutron\nstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-powered\nmillisecond pulsar. It has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar may\ntemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.\nOnly indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. Here we\nreport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond X-ray pulsations from a\nneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar.

This problem was solved in a previous paper by constructing\na spectral representation of the equation of state whose stellar models match a\nprescribed set of macroscopic observables. This paper improves and extends that\nwork in two significant ways: i) The method is made more robust by accounting\nfor an unexpected feature of the enthalpy based representations of the\nequations of state used in this work. After making the appropriate\nmodifications, accurate initial guesses for the spectral parameters are no\nlonger needed so Monte-Carlo techniques can now be used to ensure the best fit\nto the observables. ii) The method is extended here to use masses and tidal\ndeformabilities (which will be measured by gravitational wave observations of\nneutron-star mergers) as the macroscopic observables instead of masses and\nradii. The accuracy and reliability of this extended and more robust spectral\nmethod is evaluated in this paper using mock data for observables from stars\nbased on 34 different theoretical models of the high density neutron-star\nequation of state.

We aim to establish the frequency and properties, unaffected by host\ngalaxy dilution and obscuration, of AGNs in central and satellite galaxy\nmembers, also as a function of halo-centric distance.

We see a slight tendency for AGN hosts to have either relatively\nbrighter/denser disks (or relatively fainter/diffuse bulges) than non-active\ngalaxies of similar mass. At galaxy mass scales <10^11 Msolar, central galaxies\nappear to be a factor ~4 more likely to host AGNs than satellite galaxies of\nsimilar mass.

These\nswing provided the strongest confirmation of the pulsar recycling scenario\navailable so far. During the two XMM-Newton observations that were carried out\nwhile the source was in outburst in April 2013, IGR J18245-2452 displayed a\nunique and peculiar variability of its X-ray emission. In this work, we report\non a detailed analysis of the XMM- Newton data and focus in particular on the\ntiming and spectral variability of the source. IGR J18245-2452 continuously\nswitches between lower and higher intensity states, with typical variations in\nflux up to a factor of about 500 in time scales as short as few seconds. These\nvariations in the source intensity are sometimes associated to a dramatic\nspectral hardening, during which the power-law photon index of the source\nchanges from Gamma=1.7 to Gamma=0.9. The pulse profiles extracted at different\ncount rates and energies show a complex variability. These phenomena are not\nusually observed in accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, at least not on such a\nshort time scale. Fast variability was also found in the ATCA radio\nobservations carried out for about 6 hours during the outburst at a frequency\nof 5.5 and 9 GHz.

Abstract: Galaxy clustering sets strong constraints on the physics governing galaxy\nformation and evolution. However, most current models fail to reproduce the\nclustering of low-mass galaxies on small scales ($r<1Mpc/h$). In this paper we\nstudy the galaxy clusterings predicted from a few semi-analytical models. We\nfirstly compare two Munich versions, Guo et al. (2011, Guo11) and De Lucia \\&\nBlazoit (2007, DLB07). The Guo11 model well reproduces the galaxy stellar mass\nfunction, but over-predicts the clustering of low-mass galaxies on small\nscales. The DLB07 model provides a better fit to the clustering on small\nscales, but over-predicts the stellar mass function. These seem to be puzzling.\nWe find that there is slightly more fraction of satellite galaxies residing in\nmassive haloes in the Guo11 model, which is the dominant contribution to the\nclustering discrepancy between the two models. However, both models still\nover-predict the clustering at $0.1Mpc/h<r<10Mpc/h$ for low mass galaxies. This\nis because both models over-predict the number of satellites by $30\\%$ in\nmassive halos than the data. Actually, the better agreement of DLB07 model with\nthe data on small scales comes as a coincidence as it predicts too many\nlow-mass central galaxies which are less clustered and thus bring down the\ntotal clustering. Finally, we show the predictions from the semi-analytical of\nKang et al. (2012). We find that this model can simultaneously fit the stellar\nmass function and galaxy clustering if the supernova feedback in satellite\ngalaxies is stronger. We conclude that semi-analytical models are now able to\nsolve the small-scales clustering problem, without invoking of any other new\nphysics or changing the dark matter properties, such as the recent favored warm\ndark matter. \n\n"}

Our main result is an optimal data structure for Internal Pattern Matching\n(IPM) queries which, given two fragments $x$ and $y$, ask for a representation\nof all fragments contained in $y$ and matching $x$ exactly; this problem can be\nviewed as an internal version of the Exact Pattern Matching problem. Our data\nstructure answers IPM queries in time proportional to the quotient $|y|/|x|$ of\nfragments' lengths, which is required due to the information content of the\noutput. If $T$ is a text of length $n$ over an integer alphabet of size\n$\\sigma$, then our data structure occupies $O(n/ \\log_\\sigma n)$ machine words\n(that is, $O(n\\log \\sigma)$ bits) and admits an $O(n/ \\log_\\sigma n)$-time\nconstruction algorithm.\n  We show the applicability of IPM queries for answering internal queries\ncorresponding to other classic string processing problems.

The presence of an extra\ngravitational coupling, however, is tightly constrained by local measurements.\nIn chameleon modifications of gravity, local tests can be evaded by employing a\nscreening mechanism that suppresses the fifth force in dense environments.\nWhile the chameleon field may be screened in the interior of the cluster, its\nouter region can still be affected by the extra force, introducing a deviation\nbetween the hydrostatic and lensing mass of the cluster. Thus, the chameleon\nmodification can be tested by combining the gas and lensing measurements of the\ncluster.

We\nestimate the possible growth rates and duty cycles of these episodes, both\nassuming slim accretion disk solutions, and adopting the results of recent\nnumerical simulations.

The BBN model with an X-\nparticle was originally motivated by the discrepancy between 6,7Li abundances\npredicted in standard BBN model and those inferred from observations of\nmetal-poor stars. In this model 7Be is destroyed via the recombination with an\nX- particle followed by radiative proton capture. We calculate precise rates\nfor the radiative recombinations of 7Be, 7Li, 9Be, and 4He with X-. In\nnonresonant rates we take into account respective partial waves of scattering\nstates and respective bound states. The finite sizes of nuclear charge\ndistributions cause deviations in wave functions from those of point-charge\nnuclei. For a heavy X- mass, m_X \\gtrsim 100 GeV, the d-wave --> 2P transition\nis most important for 7Li and 7,9Be, unlike recombination with electrons. Our\nnew nonresonant rate of the 7Be recombination for m_X=1000 GeV is more than 6\ntimes larger than the existing rate. Moreover, we suggest a new important\nreaction for 9Be production: the recombination of 7Li and X- followed by\ndeuteron capture. We derive binding energies of X-nuclei along with reaction\nrates and Q-values. We then calculate BBN and find that the amount of 7Be\ndestruction depends significantly on the charge distribution of 7Be. Finally,\nupdated constraints on the initial abundance and the lifetime of the X- are\nderived in the context of revised upper limits to the primordial 6Li abundance.\nParameter regions for the solution to the 7Li problem are revised, and the\nprimordial 9Be abundances is revised. \n\n"}

We show how the\nimminent detection of gravitational waves from merging neutron star binaries\ncan be used to solve this riddle. Using a large number of accurate\nnumerical-relativity simulations of binaries with nuclear equations of state,\nwe find that the postmerger emission is characterized by two distinct and\nrobust spectral features. While the high-frequency peak has already been\nassociated with the oscillations of the hypermassive neutron star produced by\nthe merger and depends on the equation of state, a new correlation emerges\nbetween the low-frequency peak, related to the merger process, and the total\ncompactness of the stars in the binary. More importantly, such a correlation is\nessentially universal, thus providing a powerful tool to set tight constraints\non the equation of state. If the mass of the binary is known from the inspiral\nsignal, the combined use of the two frequency peaks sets four simultaneous\nconstraints to be satisfied. Ideally, even a single detection would be\nsufficient to select one equation of state over the others.

During the high-velocity\nencounter of ESO137-001 with the intracluster medium, a dramatic ram-pressure\nstripping event gives rise to an extended gaseous tail, traced by our MUSE\nobservations to >30 kpc from the galaxy center.

We consider the limit\nof a massless trojan companion of a giant planet. Without other planets, this\nis a case of the elliptic restricted three body problem (ERTBP). The presence\nof more planets (the restricted multi-planet problem, RMPP) induces new direct\nand indirect secular effects on the trojan's dynamics. In the theoretical part\nof this paper, we develop a Hamiltonian formalism in action-angle variables,\nwhich allows to treat in a unified way resonant dynamics and secular effects on\nthe trojan body in both the ERTBP or the RMPP. Our formalism leads to a\ndecomposition of the Hamiltonian in two parts, $H=H_b+H_{sec}$. $H_b$, called\nthe basic model, describes resonant dynamics in the short-period (epicyclic)\nand synodic (libration) degrees of freedom. $H_{sec}$ contains only terms\ndepending on slow (secular) angles. $H_b$ is formally identical in the ERTBP\nand the RMPP, apart from a re-definition of angular variables. An important\nphysical consequence is that the slow chaotic diffusion proceeds in both the\nERTBP and the RMPP by a qualitatively similar dynamical mechanism better\napproximated by the paradigm of `modulational diffusion'.

Determination of the fundamental interactions that\ngovern matter under such extreme conditions is one of the major unsolved\nproblems of modern physics, and -- since it is impossible to replicate these\nconditions on Earth -- a major scientific motivation for SKA.

For this limit, we demonstrate\nthat relativistic reconnection is highly efficient at accelerating particles\nthrough a first-order Fermi process accomplished by the curvature drift of\nparticles along the electric field induced by the relativistic flows.

We present chemical\nevolution models to investigate if TDGs that formed at very high redshifts,\nwhere the metallicity of their parent galaxy was very low, can produce the\nobserved MZ relation. Assuming that galaxy interactions were more frequent in\nthe denser high-redshift universe, TDGs could constitute an important\ncontribution to the dwarf galaxy population. The survey of chemical evolution\nmodels of TDGs presented here captures for the first time an initial mass\nfunction (IMF) of stars that is dependent on both the star formation rate and\nthe gas metallicity via the integrated galactic IMF (IGIMF) theory. As TDGs\nform in the tidal debris of interacting galaxies, the pre-enrichment of the\ngas, an underlying pre-existing stellar population, infall, and mass dependent\noutflows are considered.

Yet, despite these\nadvances, the extreme parameter regimes encountered in space physics and\nastrophysics (as in atmospheric and oceanic physics) still preclude direct\nnumerical simulation. Numerical models must take a Large Eddy Simulation (LES)\napproach, explicitly computing only a fraction of the active dynamical scales.\nThe success of such an approach hinges on how well the model can represent the\nsubgrid-scales (SGS) that are not explicitly resolved. In addition to the\nparameter regime, heliophysical and astrophysical applications must also face\nan equally daunting challenge: magnetism. The presence of magnetic fields in a\nturbulent, electrically conducting fluid flow can dramatically alter the\ncoupling between large and small scales, with potentially profound implications\nfor LES/SGS modeling.

Abstract: Tribrid inflation is a variant of supersymmetric hybrid inflation in which\nthe inflaton is a matter field (which can be charged under gauge symmetries)\nand inflation ends by a GUT-scale phase transition of a waterfall field. These\nfeatures make tribrid inflation a promising framework for realising inflation\nwith particularly close connections to particle physics. Superpotentials of\ntribrid inflation involve effective operators suppressed by some cutoff scale,\nwhich is often taken as the Planck scale. However, these operators may also be\ngenerated by integrating out messenger superfields with masses below the Planck\nscale, which is in fact quite common in GUT and/or flavour models. The values\nof the inflaton field during inflation can then lie above this mass scale,\nwhich means that for reliably calculating the model predictions one has to go\nbeyond the effective theory description. We therefore discuss realisations of\neffective theories of tribrid inflation and specify in which cases effects from\nthe messenger fields are expected, and under which conditions they can safely\nbe neglected. In particular, we point out how to construct realisations where,\ndespite the fact that the inflaton field values are above the messenger mass\nscale, the predictions for the observables are (to a good approximation)\nidentical to the ones calculated in the effective theory treatment where the\nmessenger mass scale is identified with the (apparent) cutoff scale. \n\n"}

In order to\nappreciably affect the stellar structure, it is found that the total charge\nshould be of order $10^{20}[\\rm C]$, implying an electric field of around\n$10^{22}[\\rm V/m]$.

From the position and the morphology, it is often believed that the\nrelics are generated by cosmic-ray (CR) electrons accelerated at shocks through\na diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism. However, some radio relics have\nharder spectra than the prediction of the standard DSA model. One example is\nobserved in the cluster 1RXS J0603.3+4214, which is often called the\n``Toothbrush Cluster''. Interestingly, the position of the relic is shifted\nfrom that of a possible shock. In this study, we show that these discrepancies\nin the spectrum and the position can be solved if turbulent (re)acceleration is\nvery effective behind the shock. This means that for some relics turbulent\nreacceleration may be the main mechanism to produce high-energy electrons,\ncontrary to the common belief that it is the DSA. Moreover, we show that for\nefficient reacceleration, the effective mean free path of the electrons has to\nbe much smaller than their Coulomb mean free path.

As systematics become the main contributors to the error budget, it\nhas become imperative to expand supernova cosmology analyses to include a more\ngeneral likelihood to model systematics to remove biases with losses in\nprecision. To illustrate an example likelihood analysis, we use a simple model\nof two populations with a relative luminosity shift, independent intrinsic\ndispersions, and linear redshift evolution of the relative fraction of each\npopulation.

Given the results of our\nanalysis, we expect the observational properties of 21-cm superradiance to be\ncharacterized by the emission of high intensity, spatially compact, burst-like\nfeatures potentially taking place over short periods ranging from minutes to\ndays. \n\n"}

Although they\nhave not yielded any detections, they have been successful in establishing\nupper limits on the flux of these particles. I present a review of these\nexperiments in which I re-evaluate their sensitivity to radio pulses,\naccounting for effects which were neglected in the original reports, and\ncompare them with prospective near-future experiments.

Brown dwarfs are observed to\nemit cyclotron radio emission. We show that signatures of strong transient\natmospheric ionisation events (flash ionisation) can be imprinted on a\npre-existing radiation. Detection of such flash ionisation events will open\ninvestigations into the ionisation state and atmospheric dynamics. Such\nionisation events can also result from explosion shock waves, bursts or\neruptions. We present an analytical model that describes the modulation of a\npre-existing electromagnetic radiation by a time-dependent (flash) conductivity\nthat is characteristic for flash ionisation events like lightning. Our\nconductivity model reproduces the conductivity function derived from\nobservations of Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flashes, and is applicable to\nastrophysical objects with strong temporal variations in the local ionization,\nas in planetary atmospheres and protoplanetary disks. We show that the field\nresponds with a characteristic flash-shaped pulse to a conductivity flash of\nintermediate intensity. More powerful ionisation events result in smaller\nvariations of the initial radiation, or in its damping. We show that the\ncharacteristic damping of the response field for high-power initial radiation\ncarries information about the ionisation flash magnitude and duration. The\nduration of the pulse amplification or the damping is consistently shorter for\nlarger conductivity variations and can be used to evaluate the intensity of the\nflash ionisation.

From 2012 to 2015, we collected 70 radial velocity\n(RV) measurements with HARPS-N and 36 with TRES of Pr0211. Simultaneous\nphotometric observations were carried out with the robotic STELLA telescope in\norder to characterize the stellar activity.

We confirm that Pr0211b has a nearly circular orbit ($e =\n0.02 \\pm 0.01$), with an improvement of a factor two with respect to the\nprevious determination of its eccentricity, and estimate that Pr0211c has a\nmass $M_p\\sin i = 7.9 \\pm 0.2 M_J$, a period $P>$3500 days and a very eccentric\norbit ($e>$0.60).

Assuming an\ninitial chiral asymmetry in the symmetric phase at temperatures higher than the\ntransition temperature, as well as the existence of magnetic fields, it is\ndemonstrated that the asymmetry typically grows with time, until it undergoes a\nfast decrease at the transition, and then eventually gets damped at lower\ntemperatures in the broken phase.

Dust has a profound effect on the physics and chemistry of\nthe interstellar gas in galaxies and on the appearance of galaxies.\nUnderstanding the cosmic evolution of dust with time is therefore crucial for\nunderstanding the evolution of galaxies. Despite the importance of interstellar\ndust, very little is known about its nature and composition in distant\ngalaxies. We summarize the results of our ongoing programs using observations\nof distant quasars to obtain better constraints on dust grains in foreground\ngalaxies that happen to lie along the quasar sightlines. These observations\nconsist of a combination of mid-infrared data obtained with the Spitzer Space\nTelescope and optical/UV data obtained with ground-based telescopes and/or the\nHubble Space Telescope. The mid-IR data target the 10 $\\mu$m and 18 $\\mu$m\nsilicate absorption features, while the optical/UV data allow determinations of\nelement depletions, extinction curves, 2175 {\\AA} bumps, etc. Measurements of\nsuch properties in absorption-selected galaxies with redshifts ranging from\n$z\\sim0$ to $z>2$ provide constraints on the evolution of interstellar dust\nover the past $> 10$ Gyr.

Its continuum, which\nusually appears normal, decreases by a factor 3.5 at 3000{\\AA}, compared to its\nmore typical bright state during an interval of 23 days. During this sudden\ncontinuum cut-off, the broad emission line fluxes do not change, perhaps due to\nthe large size of the Broad Line Region (BLR), r > 23 / (1+z) days. The UV\ncontinuum may have suffered a dramatic drop out. However, there are some\ndifficulties with this explanation. Another possibility is that the intrinsic\ncontinuum did not change, but was temporarily blocked out, at least towards our\nline of sight.

The recent\nproposed set of Gaia FGK benchmark stars of Heiter et al. (2015) has no\nrecommended stars within the critical metallicity range of $-2.0 <$ [Fe/H] $<\n-1.0$ dex. In this paper, we aim to add candidate Gaia benchmark stars inside\nof this metal-poor gap.

The procedure used to determine the stellar\nparameters was similar to Heiter et al. (2015) and Jofre et al. (2014) for\nconsistency. The effective temperature (T$_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) of all candidate\nstars was determined using the Infrared Flux Method utilizing multi-band\nphotometry.

The speed of emergence determined by tracking the flow\ndivergence with depth is about 1.4 km/s, very close to the emergence speed in\nthe deep layers. As the emerging magnetic flux becomes concentrated in sunspots\nlocal converging flows are observed beneath the forming sunspots.

The flattening of the low mass end of the quiescent galaxy stellar\nmass function seen at z~1 can be entirely explained by the addition of rapidly\nquenched galaxies. Only if a significant fraction of post-starburst galaxies\nhave features that are visible for longer than 250Myr, or they acquire new gas\nand return to the star-forming sequence, can there be significant growth of the\nred sequence from a slower quenching route.

The\nslope of the radial iron gradient of the young red-giant population\n($-0.058\\pm0.008$ [stat.] $\\pm0.003$ [syst.] dex/kpc) is consistent with recent\nCepheid measurements. For stellar populations with ages of $1-4$ Gyr the\ngradient is slightly steeper, at a value of $-0.066\\pm0.007\\pm0.002$ dex/kpc,\nand then flattens again to reach a value of $\\sim-0.03$ dex/kpc for stars with\nages between 6 and 10 Gyr. Our results are in good agreement with a\nstate-of-the-art chemo-dynamical Milky-Way model in which the evolution of the\nabundance gradient and its scatter can be entirely explained by a non-varying\nnegative metallicity gradient in the interstellar medium, together with stellar\nradial heating and migration. We also offer an explanation for why\nintermediate-age open clusters in the Solar Neighbourhood can be more\nmetal-rich, and why their radial metallicity gradient seems to be much steeper\nthan that of the youngest clusters. Already within 2 Gyr, radial mixing can\nbring metal-rich clusters from the innermost regions of the disc to\nGalactocentric radii of 5 to 8 kpc. We suggest that these outward-migrating\nclusters may be less prone to tidal disruption and therefore steepen the local\nintermediate-age cluster metallicity gradient. Our scenario also explains why\nthe strong steepening of the local iron gradient with age is not seen in field\nstars. In the near future, asteroseismic data from the K2 mission will allow\nfor improved statistics and a better coverage of the inner-disc regions,\nthereby providing tighter constraints on the evolution of the central parts of\nthe Milky Way. \n\n"}

We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide\nillustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion\nof the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources.

The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the\ntypical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas.

If the\nenergy is drawn from the magnetic energy of a compact object such as a\nmagnetized neutron star, the sources should be nearby and be very rare. If the\nintergalactic medium is responsible for the observed dispersion measure, the\nrequired gamma-ray energy is comparable to that of the early afterglow or\nextended emission of short gamma-ray bursts.

Based on full nuclear network simulations we\ncalculate the resulting light curves in different wavelength bands. We\nscrutinize the robustness of the results by comparing a) two different nuclear\nreaction networks and b) two macronova models. We explore in particular how\nsensitive the results are to the production of alpha-decaying trans-lead\nnuclei. We compare two frequently used mass models: the Finite-Range Droplet\nModel (FRDM) and the nuclear mass model of Duflo and Zuker (DZ31). We find that\nthe abundance of alpha-decaying trans-lead nuclei has a significant impact on\nthe observability of the resulting macronovae. For example, the DZ31 model\nyields considerably larger abundances resulting in larger heating rates and\nthermalization efficiencies and therefore predicts substantially brighter\nmacronova transients. We find that the dynamic ejecta from NSNS models can\nreach peak K-band magnitudes in excess of -15 while those from NSBH cases can\nreach beyond -16. Similar values can be reached by some of our wind models.\nSeveral of our models (both wind and dynamic ejecta) yield properties that are\nsimilar to the transient that was observed in the aftermath of the short GRB\n130603B.

They eject only ~ 0.1 Msun and may\nbe the main way to form double neutron-star systems which eventually merge\nemitting strong gravitational waves. We follow the evolution of an\nultra-stripped supernova progenitor until iron core collapse and perform\nexplosive nucleosynthesis calculations. We then synthesize light curves and\nspectra of ultra-stripped supernovae using the nucleosynthesis results and\npresent their expected properties. Ultra-stripped supernovae synthesize ~ 0.01\nMsun of radioactive 56Ni, and their typical peak luminosity is around 1e42\nerg/s or -16 mag. Their typical rise time is 5 - 10 days. Comparing synthesized\nand observed spectra, we find that SN 2005ek, some of the so-called\ncalcium-rich gap transients, and SN 2010X may be related to ultra-stripped\nsupernovae.

For isolated haloes, we find that the\nevolution can be adequately captured by treating the scattering as isotropic,\nas long as the isotropic cross-section is appropriately matched to the\nunderlying anisotropic model. We find that this matching should not be done\nusing the momentum transfer cross-section, as has been done previously.\nMatching should instead be performed via a modified momentum transfer\ncross-section that takes into account that dark matter particles can be\nrelabelled after they scatter, without altering the dynamics.

If the compact object\nis a pulsar, non-thermal emissions are likely produced by electrons accelerated\nat the termination shock, and may also originate from the magnetosphere and the\nun-shocked wind of the pulsar. In this paper, we investigate the non-thermal\nemissions from the wind and the shock with different viewing geometries and\nstudy the multi-wavelength emissions from 1FGL J1018.6-5856. We present the\nanalysis results of the \\textit{Fermi}/LAT using nearly 10 years of data. The\nphase-resolved spectra indicate that the GeV emissions comprise a rather steady\ncomponent that does not vary with orbital motion and a modulated component that\nshows flux maximum around inferior conjunction. The keV/TeV light curves of\n1FGL J1018.6-5856 also exhibit a sharp peak around inferior conjunction, which\nare attributed to the boosted emission from the shock, while the broad\nsinusoidal modulations could be originating from the deflected shock tail at a\nlarger distance. The modulations of GeV flux are likely caused by the boosted\nsynchrotron emission from the shock and the IC emission from the un-shocked\npulsar wind, while the steady component comes from the outer gap of the pulsar\nmagnetosphere. Finally, we discuss the similarities and differences of 1FGL\nJ1018.6-5856 with other binaries, like LS 5039. \n\n"}

One problem that plagues the use of this tool in the era of\nlarge-scale sky surveys is that the bright galaxies that are selected for\nspectroscopic observation do not have properties that match those of (far more\nnumerous) dimmer galaxies; thus, ill-designed empirical methods that produce\naccurate and precise redshift estimates for the former generally will not\nproduce good estimates for the latter. In this paper, we provide a principled\nframework for generating conditional density estimates (i.e. photometric\nredshift PDFs) that takes into account selection bias and the covariate shift\nthat this bias induces. We base our approach on the assumption that the\nprobability that astronomers label a galaxy (i.e. determine its spectroscopic\nredshift) depends only on its measured (photometric and perhaps other)\nproperties x and not on its true redshift. With this assumption, we can\nexplicitly write down risk functions that allow us to both tune and compare\nmethods for estimating importance weights (i.e. the ratio of densities of\nunlabeled and labeled galaxies for different values of x) and conditional\ndensities. We also provide a method for combining multiple conditional density\nestimates for the same galaxy into a single estimate with better properties.

In this paper we quantify to what precision the abundances of\nmany different elements can be recovered, as a function of spectroscopic\nresolution and wavelength range. In the limit of perfect spectral models and\nspectral normalization, we show that the precision of elemental abundances is\nnearly independent of resolution, for a fixed exposure time and number of\ndetector pixels; low-resolution spectra simply afford much higher S/N per pixel\nand generally larger wavelength range in a single setting.

The combination of\nnumber of sources, sensitivity, angular resolution and area covered by this\nproject are unprecedented. We have detected 468 radio sources, expected to be\nAGNs, with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 1.4 GHz.

Recently, the first DAMPE results on the CRE flux hinted at a narrow\nexcess at energy ~1.4 TeV. We show that in general a spectral structure with a\nnarrow width appears in two scenarios: I) \"Spectrum broadening\" for the\ncontinuous sources with a delta-function-like injection spectrum. In this\nscenario, a finite width can develop after propagation through the Galaxy,\nwhich can reveal the distance of the source. Well-motivated sources include\nmini-spikes and subhalos formed by dark matter (DM) particles $\\chi_{s}$ which\nannihilate directly into e+e- pairs. II) \"Phase-space shrinking\" for burst-like\nsources with a power-law-like injection spectrum. The spectrum after\npropagation can shrink at a cooling-related cutoff energy and form a sharp\nspectral peak. The peak can be more prominent due to the energy-dependent\ndiffusion. In this scenario, the width of the excess constrains both the power\nindex and the distance of the source. Possible such sources are pulsar wind\nnebulae (PWNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs). We analysis the DAMPE excess and\nfind that the continuous DM sources should be fairly close within ~0.3 kpc, and\nthe annihilation cross sections are close to the thermal value. For the\nburst-like source, the narrow width of the excess suggests that the injection\nspectrum must be hard with power index significantly less than two, the\ndistance is within ~(3-4) kpc, and the age of the source is ~0.16 Myr. In both\nscenarios, large anisotropies in the CRE flux are predicted. We identify\npossible candidates of mini-spike (PWN) sources in the current Fermi-LAT 3FGL\n(ATNF) catalog.

Effects of Star\n  Formation Efficiency and Stellar Feedback Abstract: The implementation of star formation and stellar feedback in cosmological\nsimulations plays a critical role in shaping galaxy properties. In the first\npaper of the series, we presented a new method to model star formation as a\ncollection of star clusters. In this paper, we improve the algorithm by\neliminating accretion gaps, boosting momentum feedback, and introducing a\nsubgrid initial bound fraction, $f_i$, that distinguishes cluster mass from\nstellar particle mass. We perform a suite of simulations with different star\nformation efficiency per freefall time $\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$ and supernova\nmomentum feedback intensity $f_{\\rm boost}$. We find that the star formation\nhistory of a Milky Way-sized galaxy is sensitive to $f_{\\rm boost}$, which\nallows us to constrain its value, $f_{\\rm boost}\\approx5$, in the current\nsimulation setup. Changing $\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$ from a few percent to 200\\% has\nlittle effect on global galaxy properties. However, on smaller scales, the\nproperties of star clusters are very sensitive to $\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$. We find\nthat $f_i$ increases with $\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$ and cluster mass.

This extra term\ninvolves the moment of inertia of the neutron stars. Moment of inertia, on the\nother hand, depends on the mass and spin of the neutron star as well as the\nequation of state of the matter. If at least one member of the double neutron\nstar binary (better the faster one) is a radio pulsar, then accurate timing\nanalysis might lead to the estimation of the contribution of the Lense-Thirring\neffect to the periastron advance, which will lead to the measurement of the\nmoment of inertia of the pulsar. Combination of the knowledge on the values of\nthe moment of inertia, the mass, and the spin of the pulsar, will give a new\nconstraint on the equation of state. Pulsars in double neutron star binaries\nare the best for this purpose as short orbits and moderately high\neccentricities make the Lense-Thirring effect substantial, whereas tidal\neffects are negligible (unlike pulsars with main sequence or white-dwarf\nbinaries). The most promising pulsars are PSR J0737-3039A and PSR J1757-1854.\nThe spin-precession of pulsars due to the misalignment between the spin and the\norbital angular momentum vectors affect the contribution of the Lense-Thirring\neffect to the periastron advance. This effect has been explored for both PSR\nJ0737-3039A and PSR J1757-1854, and as the misalignment angles for both of\nthese pulsars are small, the variation in the Lense-Thirring term is not much.\nHowever, to extract the Lense-Thirring effect from the observed rate of the\nperiastron advance, more accurate timing solutions including precise proper\nmotion and distance measurements are essential. \n\n"}

The sensitivity of the\nsurvey is of f(Halpha) ~ 4 x 10^-17 erg sec-1 cm^-2 (5 sigma detection limit)\nfor point sources and Sigma (Halpha) ~ 2 x 10^-18 erg sec^-1 cm^-2 arcsec^-2 (1\nsigma detection limit at 3 arcsec resolution) for extended sources, making\nVESTIGE the deepest and largest blind narrow-band survey of a nearby cluster.\nThis paper presents the survey in all its technical aspects, including the\nsurvey design, the observing strategy, the achieved sensitivity in both the\nnarrow-band Halpha+[NII] and in the broad-band r filter used for the stellar\ncontinuum subtraction, the data reduction, calibration, and products, as well\nas its status after the first observing semester. We briefly describe the\nHalpha properties of galaxies located in a 4x1 deg^2 strip in the core of the\ncluster north of M87, where several extended tails of ionised gas are detected.\nThis paper also lists the main scientific motivations of VESTIGE, which include\nthe study of the effects of the environment on galaxy evolution, the fate of\nthe stripped gas in cluster objects, the star formation process in nearby\ngalaxies of different type and stellar mass, the determination of the Halpha\nluminosity function and of the Halpha scaling relations down to ~ 10^6 Mo\nstellar mass objects, and the reconstruction of the dynamical structure of the\nVirgo cluster. This unique set of data will also be used to study the HII\nluminosity function in hundreds of galaxies, the diffuse Halpha+[NII] emission\nof the Milky Way at high Galactic latitude, and the properties of emission line\ngalaxies at high redshift. \n\n"}

Our\napproach treats the oracle as a complete black box, and is not dependent on its\ninner workings, or the exact distribution of its errors.\n  We apply this framework to the traditional caching problem -- creating an\neviction strategy for a cache of size $k$. We demonstrate that naively\nfollowing the oracle's recommendations may lead to very poor performance, even\nwhen the average error is quite low. Instead we show how to modify the Marker\nalgorithm to take into account the oracle's predictions, and prove that this\ncombined approach achieves a competitive ratio that both (i) decreases as the\noracle's error decreases, and (ii) is always capped by $O(\\log k)$, which can\nbe achieved without any oracle input.

X-ray irradiation from the central source heats disc surface,\nforming a wind from the outer disc where the local escape velocity is lower\nthan the sound speed.

Thanks to RXTE, we discovered that neutron\nstars in LMXBs spins at 200-750 Hz frequencies, and indirectly confirmed the\nrecycling scenario, according to which neutron stars are spun up to ms periods\nduring the LMXB-phase. In the meantime, the continuous discovery of\nrotation-powered MSPs in binary systems in the radio and gamma-ray band (mainly\nwith the Fermi LAT) allowed us to classify these sources into two \"spiders\"\npopulations, depending on the mass of their companion stars: Black Widow, with\nvery low-mass companion stars, and Redbacks, with larger companions possibly\nfilling their Roche lobes but without accretion. It was soon regained that MSPs\nin short orbital period LMXBs are the progenitors of the spider populations of\nrotation-powered MSPs, although a direct link between accretion- and\nrotation-powered MSPs was still missing. In 2013 XMM-Newton spotted the X-ray\noutburst of a new accreting MSP (IGR J18245-2452) in a source that was\npreviously classified as a radio MSP. Follow up observations of the source when\nit went back to X-ray quiescence showed that it was able to swing between\naccretion- to rotation-powered pulsations in a relatively short timescale (few\ndays), promoting this source as the direct link between the LMXB and the radio\nMSP phases. Following discoveries showed that there exists a bunch of sources,\nwhich alternates X-ray activity phases, showing X-ray pulsations, to radio-loud\nphases, showing radio pulsations, establishing a new class of MSPs: the\nTransitional MSP. In this review we describe these exciting discoveries and the\nproperties of accreting and transitional MSPs, highlighting what we know and\nwhat we have still to learn about in order to fully understand the (sometime\npuzzling) behavior of these systems and their evolutive connection (abridged). \n\n"}

We\nmodeled the ionised gas combining the mid- and far-infrared fine-structure\ncooling lines observed with Spitzer/IRS and Herschel/PACS, with the\nphotoionisation code Cloudy. The free parameters of the models are the age of\nthe stellar cluster, the density and the ionisation parameter of the ionised\ngas as well as the depth of the cloud. The latter is used to investigate the\nleakage of the ionising photons from the analysed regions of IC 10. We\ninvestigate HII regions in the main star-forming body, on scales of ~25 pc,\nthree in the main star-forming region in the center of the galaxy and two on\nthe first arc.

Our\nchosen halo has a total mass of ~10^12 Msun at z ~ 2, and we achieve a median\ngas mass (spatial) resolution of ~2,200 solar masses (~95 parsecs) in the CGM,\nsix-hundred (fourteen) times better than in the Illustris-1 simulation, a\nhigher spatial resolution than any cosmological simulation at this mass scale\nto date.

A correction for\ndust attenuation, A_UV, is needed for these measurements. This correction is\ntypically inferred from UV spectral slopes (beta) using an equation known as\n\"Meurer's Relation.\" In this paper, we study this relation at a redshift of 1.5\nusing images and photometric measurements in the rest-frame UV (HST) through\nmid-infrared (Spitzer). It is shown that massive star-forming galaxies (above\n10^10 Msun) have dust corrections that are dependent on their inclination to\nthe line-of-sight. Edge-on galaxies have higher A_UV and infrared excess\n(IRX=L(IR)/L(UV)) than face-on galaxies at a given beta. Interestingly, dust\ncorrections for low-mass star-forming galaxies do not depend on inclination.\nThis is likely because more massive galaxies have more disk-like\nshapes/kinematics, while low-mass galaxies are more prolate and have more\ndisturbed kinematics. To account for an inclination-dependent dust correction,\na modified Meurer's Relation is derived: A_UV=4.43+1.99 beta - 1.73 (b/a-0.67),\nwhere b/a is the galaxy axis ratio. This inclination-dependence of A_UV can be\nexplained by a two-component model of the dust distribution inside galaxies. In\nsuch a model, the dust attenuation of edge-on galaxies has a higher\ncontribution from a \"mixture\" component (dust uniformly mixed with stars in the\ndiffuse interstellar medium), and a lower contribution from a \"birth cloud\"\ncomponent (near-spherical dust shells surrounding young stars in H II regions)\nthan that of face-on galaxies.

Soon later, Thorup [FOCS 1998] claimed that recognizing map graphs is\nin $\\mathsf{P}$, by providing an $\\Omega(n^{120})$-time algorithm for\n$n$-vertex input graphs.\n  In this note, we give good characterizations and efficient recognition for\nhalf-squares of bipartite graphs with girth at least a given integer $g\\ge 8$.\nIt turns out that map graphs having witnesses of girth at least $g$ are\nprecisely the graphs whose vertex-clique incidence bipartite graph is planar\nand of girth at least $g$. Our structural characterization implies an\n$O(n^2m)$-time algorithm for recognizing if a given $n$-vertex $m$-edge graph\n$G$ is such a map graph. \n\n"}

We consider two sets of models with cold or warm disks\nthat differ in the radial velocity dispersions, and vary the gas fraction\n$f_{\\rm gas}$ by fixing the total disk mass. A bar forms earlier and more\nstrongly in the cold disks with larger $f_{\\rm gas}$, while gas progressively\ndelays the bar formation in the warm disks . The bar formation enhances a\ncentral mass concentration which in turn makes the bar decay temporarily, after\nwhich it regrows in size and strength, eventually becoming stronger in models\nwith smaller $f_{\\rm gas}$. Although all bars rotate fast in the beginning,\nthey rapidly turn to slow rotators.

The gas driven inward by the bar potential readily forms\na star-forming nuclear ring. The ring is very small when it first forms and\ngrows in size over time. The ring star formation rate is episodic and bursty\ndue to feedback, and well correlated with the mass inflow rate to the ring.\nSome expanding shells produced by star formation feedback are sheared out in\nthe bar regions and collide with dust lanes to appear as filamentary interbar\nspurs.

We show that,\nas suggested by Strohmayer and colleagues, the frequency changes of 1-2 Hz\nobserved during bursts are consistent with angular momentum conservation as the\nburning shell hydrostatically expands and contracts. We calculate how vertical\nheat propagation through the radiative outer layers of the atmosphere and\nconvection affect the coherence of the oscillation.

Our study is based on 209\npointed observations using the PCA and HEXTE instruments onboard the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer spanning 250 days and covering the entire double-peaked\neruption that occurred from 1998 September until 1999 May. The spectra are fit\nto a model including multicolor blackbody disk and power-law components. The\nsource is observed in the very high and high/soft outburst states of black hole\nX-ray novae. During the very high state, when the power-law component dominated\nthe spectrum, the inner disk radius is observed to vary by more than an order\nof magnitude; the radius decreased by a factor of 16 in one day during a 6.8\nCrab flare. If the larger of these observed radii is taken to be the last\nstable orbit, then the smaller observed radius would imply that the inner edge\nof the disk is inside the event horizon! However, we conclude that the apparent\nvariations of the inner disk radius observed during periods of increased\npower-law emission are probably caused by the failure of the multicolor\ndisk/power-law model; the actual physical radius of the inner disk may remain\nfairly constant. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the observed\ninner disk radius remains approximately constant over 120 days in the high\nstate, when the power-law component is weak, even though the disk flux and\ntotal flux vary by an order of magnitude. The mass of the black hole inferred\nby equating the approximately constant inner disk radius observed in the\nhigh/soft state with the last stable orbit for a Schwarzschild black hole is\nM_BH = 7.4 M_sun (D/6 kpc) (cos i)^{-1/2}. \n\n"}

The outer\nregions of galaxies both as observed and as simulated have density profiles\nsteeper than the self-similar profile. Nevertheless there appears to be an\nintermediate region in most galaxies in which the inverse square behaviour is a\ngood description. The outer deviations can be explained plausibly in terms of\nthe transition from a self-gravitating extended halo to a Keplerian flow onto a\ndominant central mass (the isothermal distribution can not be complete), but\nthe inner deviations are more problematic.

In this paper, we present a\ntemporal and spectral analysis of a subset of BATSE GRBs with smooth extended\nemission tails to search for signatures of the ``early high-energy afterglow'',\ni.e., afterglow emission that initially begins in the gamma-ray phase and\nsubsequently evolves into X-Ray, uv, optical, and radio emission as the blast\nwave is decelerated by the ambient medium.

The\npower spectrum of the product maps does not detect any correlation and the\ncross-power spectrum does not show any significant deviation from 0. We explore\ndifferent explanations for this lack of correlation. A universe with a low\nvalue of Sigma_8 could naturally explain the lack of correlation.

The two main emission component, the black\nbody and the Comptonized tail that are clearly identified in the time-averaged\nspectrum, show strong variability with the first component lagging the second\none. The observed variability can be explained if the emission is produced by\nComptonization in a hot slab (radiative shock) of Thomson optical depth ~0.3-1\nat the neutron star surface. The emission patterns of the black body and the\nComptonized radiation are different: a \"knife\"- and a \"fan\"-like, respectively.\nWe construct a detailed model of the X-ray production accounting for the\nDoppler boosting, relativistic aberration and gravitational light bending in\nthe Schwarzschild spacetime.

The analysis reproduces all the\nrecognized regimes of hydrogen and helium bursts, and in addition shows that at\nhigh accretion rates, near the limit of stable burning, there is a regime of\n``delayed mixed bursts'' which is distinct from the more usual ``prompt mixed\nbursts.'' In delayed mixed bursts, a large fraction of the fuel is burned\nstably before the burst is triggered. Bursts thus have longer recurrence times,\nbut at the same time have somewhat smaller fluences. Therefore, the parameter\nalpha, which measures the ratio of the energy released via accretion to that\ngenerated through nuclear reactions in the burst, is up to an order of\nmagnitude larger than for prompt bursts. This increase in alpha near the\nthreshold of stable burning has been seen in observations.

They can do so because the existence of density gradients\nallows g-modes to resonantly excite Alfven waves, causing mode energy to be\nfunnelled along magnetic field lines, away from the solar equatorial plane. The\nresulting wave forms show comparatively sharp spikes in the density profile at\nradii where these resonances take place. We estimate how big these waves might\nbe in the Sun, and perform a first search for observable consequences. We find\nthe density excursions at the resonances to be too narrow to be ruled out by\npresent-day analyses of p-wave helioseismic spectra, even if their amplitudes\nwere to be larger than a few percent. (In contrast it has been shown in\n(Burgess et al. 2002) that such density excursions could affect solar neutrino\nfluxes in an important way.) Because solar p-waves are not strongly influenced\nby radiative-zone magnetic fields, standard analyses of helioseismic data\nshould not be significantly altered. The influence of the magnetic field on the\ng-mode frequency spectrum could be used to probe sufficiently large\nradiative-zone magnetic fields should solar g-modes ever be definitively\nobserved.

We follow the abundance\nevolution in this layer, in particular that of the neutron source C13 and of\nthe neutron poison N14. In our AGB model mixing persists during the entire\ninterpulse phase due to the steep angular velocity gradient at the\ncore-envelope interface. We follow the neutron production during the interpulse\nphase, and find a resulting maximum neutron exposure of tau_max =0.04 mbarn^-1,\nwhich is too small to produce any significant s-process. In parametric models,\nwe then investigate the combined effects of diffusive overshooting from the\nconvective envelope and rotationally induced mixing. Models with overshoot and\nweaker interpulse mixing - as perhaps expected from more slowly rotating stars\n- yield larger neutron exposures. We conclude that the incorporation of\nrotationally induce mixing processes has important consequences for the\nproduction of heavy elements in AGB stars. Through a distribution of initial\nrotation rates it may lead to a natural spread in the neutron exposures\nobtained in AGB stars of a given mass - as appears to be required by\nobservations.

MOND requires\ngravitation to depart from Newtonian theory in the extragalactic regime where\ndynamical accelerations are small. So far relativistic gravitation theories\nproposed to underpin MOND have either clashed with the post-Newtonian tests of\ngeneral relativity, or failed to provide significant gravitational lensing, or\nviolated hallowed principles by exhibiting superluminal scalar waves or an\n\\textit{a priori} vector field. We develop a relativistic MOND inspired theory\nwhich resolves these problems. In it gravitation is mediated by metric, a\nscalar field and a 4-vector field, all three dynamical. For a simple choice of\nits free function, the theory has a Newtonian limit for nonrelativistic\ndynamics with significant acceleration, but a MOND limit when accelerations are\nsmall. We calculate the $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ PPN coefficients showing them to\nagree with solar system measurements.

One possibility is that conditions for making young massive clusters\nare globally present in mergers while only locally present in spirals (i.e., in\nthe spiral arms). However, understanding the destruction of clusters and the\naccompanying survival rates is more important for understanding cluster\ndemographics than understanding their formation.

A Halpha tomogram reveals emission\nfrom near the donor star after subtraction of the ring-like contribution from\nthe accretion disk which we attribute to chromospheric emission.

Finally, a comparison is made with the black\nhole XRN GRO J0422+32: we show that the Halpha profile of this system also\nexhibits a behaviour consistent with a precessing disk. \n\n"}

The reason of this\nfailure is a misunderstanding of the spectroscopy of hydrogen crossed by a\npowerful beam of short wavelengths light. Except very close to the surface,\nhydrogen is mostly heated by a Lyman absorption improved by a parametric\nfrequency shift due to excited atomic hydrogen, so that this absorption\nstabilises the temperature between the limits of ionisation and dimerisation. A\npowerful radio emission may produce an extra ionisation where the pressure is\nconvenient. The combination of Lyman absorptions and redshifts produces an\ninstability which chains Lyman absorption patterns : when a redshifted Lyman\nabsorbed line coincides with a Lyman line, all absorption lines of the gas are\nwritten into the spectrum. Thus all characteristics of the complex spectrum of\na quasar are generated, so that observed accretors are named quasars, and the\norigin of the intrinsic redshifts is found. The lack of redshifts of the\nvariations of luminosity of stars and quasars shows that the \"cosmological\nredshifts\" result from the parametric frequency shift, so that the universe\ndoes not expand. \n\n"}

Here, we consider the\npossible effects of these powerful explosions on the structure of the accretion\ndisk. The goal is to account for the apparent evolution of the innermost\nregions of the accretion disk around 4U 1820-30 during a superburst. Three\ndifferent processes are considered in detail: radiatively or thermally driven\noutflows, inflow due to Poynting-Robertson drag, and a structural change to the\ndisk by X-ray heating. Radiatively driven winds with large column densities can\nbe launched from the inner disk, but only for L/L_{Edd} >~ 1, which is expected\nto be obtained only at the onset of the burst. Furthermore, the predicted mass\noutflow rate is less than the accretion rate in 4U 1820-30. Estimates of the\nPoynting-Robertson or radiative drag timescale shows that it is a very\nefficient means of removing angular momentum from the gas. However, the\nanalytical results are likely only applicable at the innermost edge of the\ndisk. X-ray heating gives a change in the disk scale height that is correlated\nwith the blackbody temperature, as seen in the evolution during the 4U 1820-30\nsuperburst. If this change in the scale height can alter the surface density,\nthen the viscous time (with \\alpha ~ 0.03-0.2) is the closest match to the 4U\n1820-30 results. We expect, however, that all three processes are likely\nongoing when an accretion disk is subject to a sudden heating event.\nUltimately, a numerical simulation of a disk around a bursting neutron star is\nrequired to determine the exact response of the disk.

Probably it is an ultracompact binary with an orbital period\nshorter than 60 min. Such binaries cannot harbor hydrogen rich donor stars. As\nwith other (sometimes confirmed) ultracompact LMXBs, 2S 0918-549 is observed to\nhave a high neon-to-oxygen abundance ratio (Juett et al. 2001) which has been\nused to argue that the companion star is a CO or ONe white dwarf. However,\ntype-I X-ray bursts have been observed from several of these systems implying\nthe presence of hydrogen or helium on the neutron star surface. In this paper,\nwe argue that the companion star in 2S 0918-549 is a helium white dwarf We\nfirst present a Type I X-ray burst from 2S 0918-549 with a long duration of 40\nminutes. We show that this burst is naturally explained by accretion of pure\nhelium at the inferred accretion rate of ~0.01 times the Eddington accretion\nrate. At higher accretion rates of ~0.1 Eddington, hydrogen is required to\nexplain long duration bursts. However, at low rates the long duration is due to\nthe large amount of helium that accumulates prior to the burst. We show that it\nis possible to form a helium white dwarf donor in an ultracompact binary if\naccretion starts during the first ascent of the giant branch, when the core is\nmade of predominantly helium. Furthermore, this scenario naturally explains the\nhigh neon-to-oxgen ratio, without requiring a CO or ONe white dwarf companion.\nThe only observational aspect of 2S 0918-549 that we cannot explain is the\nabsence of helium lines in the optical spectrum.

The angular momentum transport, disk morphology and radial\nprofiles depend sensitively on force and mass resolution. At low resolution,\nsimilar to that used in most current cosmological simulations, the cold gas\ncomponent has lost half of its initial angular momentum via different\nmechanisms. The angular momentum is transferred primarily to the hot halo\ncomponent, by resolution-dependent hydrodynamical and gravitational torques,\nthe latter arising from asymmetries in the mass distribution. In addition,\ndisk-particles can lose angular momentum while they are still in the hot phase\nby artificial viscosity. In the central disk, particles can transfer away over\n99% of their initial angular momentum due to spiral structure and/or the\npresence of a central bar. The strength of this transport also depends on force\nand mass resolution - large softening will suppress the bar instability, low\nmass resolution enhances the spiral structure. This complex interplay between\nresolution and angular momentum transfer highlights the complexity of\nsimulations of galaxy formation even in isolated haloes.

Namely, reconnection should be: fast; energetically\nimportant; and observable. From this, I deduce that the gas density should be\nlow, so that the plasma is: collisionless; force-free; and optically thin.\nThus, for example, the requirement that reconnection is fast implies that\nPetschek's reconnection mechanism must be operating, which is possible,\napparently, only in the collisionless regime. Next, I argue that the force-free\ncondition implies that the magnetic field be produced in, and anchored by, a\nnearby dense massive object, e.g., a star or a disk, strongly stratified by\ngravity. I then stress the importance of field-line opening (e.g., by\ndifferential rotation) as a means to form a reconnecting current sheet.\nCorrespondingly, I suggest the Y-point helmet streamer as a generic\nprototypical magnetic configuration relevant to large-scale reconnection in\nastrophysics. Finally, I discuss several specific astrophysical systems where\nthe above criteria are met: stellar coronae, magnetically-interacting\nstar--disk systems, and magnetized coronae above turbulent accretion disks.

Firstly, we show that global\ntorsional modes only exist when one introduces unphysically large dissipative\nterms into the equations of motion; thus global modes are not helpful for\nunderstanding the magnetar Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs). Secondly, we\nsolve the initial-value problem by simulating the sudden release of an\ninitially strained crust and monitoring the subsequent crustal motion. We find\nthat the crustal torsional modes quickly exchange their energy with the MHD\ncontinuum in the core, and decay by several orders of magnitude over the course\nof about 10 oscillation periods.

Similarly to long GRBs, afterglow detections led to\nthe identification of SHB host galaxies and measurement of their redshifts.\nThese observations established that SHBs are cosmological relativistic sources\nthat, unlike long GRBs, do not originate from the collapse of massive stars,\nand therefore constitute a distinct physical phenomenon. One viable model for\nSHB origin is the coalescence of compact binary systems (double neutron stars\nor a neutron star and a black hole), in which case SHBs are the electromagnetic\ncounterparts of strong gravitational-wave sources. The theoretical and\nobservational study of SHBs following the recent pivotal discoveries is\nreviewed, along with new theoretical results that are presented here for the\nfirst time. \n\n"}

We consider a solar mass of\nperfect gas enclosed in a spherical container. The gas is self-gravitating and\nrotating, and is the seat of nuclear heating, and heat diffusion is due to\nradiative diffusion with Kramers type opacities. Equations are solved\nnumerically with spectral methods in two dimensions with a radial Gauss-Lobatto\ngrid and spherical harmonics. We computed the centrifugally flattened structure\nof such a star: the von Zeipel model, which says that the energy flux is\nproportional to the local effective gravity is tested. We show that it\noverestimates the ratio of the polar to the equatorial energy flux by almost a\nfactor 2. We also determine the Brunt-Vaisala frequency distribution and show\nthat outer equatorial regions in a radiative zone are convectively unstable\nwhen the rotation is fast enough. We compute the differential rotation and\nmeridional circulation stemming from the baroclinicity of the star and show\nthat, in such radiative zones, equatorial regions rotate faster than polar\nones. The surface differential rotation is also shown to reach a universal\nprofile when rotation is slow enough (less than 36% of the breakup one), as\nlong as viscosity and Prandlt number remain small. \n\n"}

The equations describing the time evolution of the\nStokes parameters, of the photon distribution function and of the total\npolarization degree can be formulated as a system of coupled first order\npartial differential equations.

In multi-field models\nwith strong preheating (q \\gg 1), metric perturbations are driven nonlinear,\nwith the strongest amplification typically on super-Hubble scales (k \\to 0).\nThis amplification is causal, being due to the super- Hubble coherence of the\ninflaton condensate, and is accompanied by resonant growth of entropy\nperturbations. The amplification invalidates the use of the linearized Einstein\nfield equations, irrespective of the amount of fine-tuning of the initial\nconditions.

The conservation of energy implies that\nthe radiation stops when the mass of the black hole reaches the half of the\ninitial BH mass, leaving a massive BH remnant with a mass much above the Planck\nscale. \n\n"}

These vacuum densities correspond to a\ngravitational source of the cosmological constant type for both subspaces of\nthe branes. Using the generalized zeta function technique in combination with\ncontour integral representations, the surface energies on the branes are\npresented in the form of the sum of single brane and second brane induced\nparts. For the geometry of a single brane both regions, on the left and on the\nright of the brane, are considered. At the physical point the corresponding\nzeta functions contain pole and finite contributions. For an infinitely thin\nbrane taking these regions together, in odd spatial dimensions the pole parts\ncancel and the total zeta function is finite. The renormalization procedure for\nthe surface energies and the structure of the corresponding counterterms are\ndiscussed. The parts in the surface densities generated by the presence of the\nsecond brane are finite for all nonzero values of the interbrane separation and\nare investigated in various asymptotic regions of the parameters. In\nparticular, it is shown that for large distances between the branes the induced\nsurface densities give rise to an exponentially suppressed cosmological\nconstant on the brane. The total energy of the vacuum including the bulk and\nboundary contributions is evaluated by the zeta function technique and the\nenergy balance between separate parts is discussed. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/9512018", "contents": "Title: Nonsymmetric Gravitational Theory as a String Theory Abstract: It is shown that the new version of nonsymmetric gravitational theory (NGT)\ncorresponds in the linear approximation to linear Einstein gravity theory and\nantisymmetric field equations with a non-conserved string source current. The\nHamiltonian for the antisymmetric field equations is bounded from below and\ndescribes the exchange of a spin $1^+$ massive vector boson between open\nstrings. The non-Riemannian geometrical theory is formulated in terms of a\nnonsymmetric fundamental tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$. The weak field limit,\n$g_{[\\mu\\nu]}\\rightarrow 0$, associated with large distance scales, corresponds\nto the limit to a confinement region at low energies described by an effective\nYukawa potential at galactic distance scales. The limit to this low-energy\nconfinement region is expected to be singular and non-perturbative. The NGT\nstring theory predicts that there are no black hole event horizons associated\nwith infinite red shift null surfaces. \n\n"}

{"id": "nucl-th/9804027", "contents": "Title: The equation of state for nucleon matter and neutron star structure Abstract: Properties of dense nucleon matter and the structure of neutron stars are\nstudied using variational chain summation methods and the new Argonne v18\ntwo-nucleon interaction. The neutron star gravitational mass limit obtained\nwith this interaction is 1.67 M_{solar}. Boost corrections to the two-nucleon\ninteraction, which give the leading relativistic effect of order (v/c)^2, as\nwell as three-nucleon interactions, are also included in the nuclear\nHamiltonian. Their successive addition increases the mass limit to 1.80 and\n2.20 M_{solar}. Hamiltonians including a three-nucleon interaction predict a\ntransition in neutron star matter to a phase with neutral pion condensation at\na baryon number density of 0.2 fm^{-3}. We also investigate the possibility of\ndense nucleon matter having an admixture of quark matter, described using the\nbag model equation of state. Neutron stars of 1.4 M_{solar} do not appear to\nhave quark matter admixtures in their cores. However, the heaviest stars are\npredicted to have cores consisting of a quark and nucleon matter mixture. These\nadmixtures reduce the maximum mass of neutron stars from 2.20 to 2.02 (1.91)\nM_{solar} for bag constant B = 200 (122) MeV/fm^3. Stars with pure quark matter\nin their cores are found to be unstable. We also consider the possibility that\nmatter is maximally incompressible above an assumed density, and show that\nrealistic models of nuclear forces limit the maximum mass of neutron stars to\nbe below 2.5 M_{solar}. The effects of the phase transitions on the composition\nof neutron star matter and its adiabatic index are discussed. \n\n"}
