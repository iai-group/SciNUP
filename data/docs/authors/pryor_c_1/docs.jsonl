Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

Many more such discoveries are\nanticipated in the coming years with radial velocity and transit searches. Here\nwe investigate the different mechanisms that could form \"hot Earths\" and their\nobservable predictions. Models include: 1) in situ accretion; 2) formation at\nlarger orbital distance followed by inward \"type 1\" migration; 3) formation\nfrom material being \"shepherded\" inward by a migrating gas giant planet; 4)\nformation from material being shepherded by moving secular resonances during\ndispersal of the protoplanetary disk; 5) tidal circularization of eccentric\nterrestrial planets with close-in perihelion distances; and 6)\nphoto-evaporative mass loss of a close-in giant planet. Models 1-4 have been\nvalidated in previous work. We show that tidal circularization can form hot\nEarths, but only for relatively massive planets (> 5 Earth masses) with very\nclose-in perihelion distances (< 0.025 AU), and even then the net inward\nmovement in orbital distance is at most only 0.1-0.15 AU.

Until\nvery recently, the Galactic population consisted of a relatively well studied\ndisk population, a somewhat studied smaller bulge population and a mostly\nunknown, but potentially large halo population. It has been argued that the\nhalo population may produce a signal that is much stronger (factor of ~5 in\nspectral amplitude) than the disk population. However, this surprising result\nwas not based on an actual calculation of a halo white dwarf population but was\nderived on (i) the assumption that one can extrapolate the halo population\nproperties from those of the disk population and (ii) the postulated\n(unrealistically) high number of white dwarfs in the halo. We perform the first\ncalculation of a halo white dwarf population using population synthesis models.\nOur comparison with the signal arising from double white dwarfs in the Galactic\ndisk+bulge clearly shows that it is impossible for the double white dwarf halo\nsignal to exceed that of the rest of the Galaxy. Using microlensing results to\ngive an upper limit on the content of white dwarfs in the halo (~30 % baryonic\nmass in white dwarfs), our predicted halo signal is a factor of 10 lower than\nthe disk+bulge signal. Even in the implausible case where all of the baryonic\nhalo mass is found in white dwarfs, the halo signal does not become comparable\nto that of the disk+bulge, and thus would still have a negligible effect on the\ndetection of other LISA sources. \n\n"}

By comparing the iron abundances [Fe/H]\nwith calcium triplet (CaT) metallicities we show that the empirical CaT\ntechnique yields good agreement with the high-resolution data for [Fe/H]>-2\ndex, but tends to deviate at lower metallicities. We identify two metal poor\nstars with iron abundances of -2.72 and -2.50 dex. These stars are found to\nhave enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios similar to those of stars in the Milky Way\nhalo. However, the bulk of the Carina red giants are depleted in the [alpha/Fe]\nabundance ratios with respect to the Galactic halo at a given metallicity. One\nof our targets, with a [Fe/H] of -1.5 dex, is considerably depleted in almost\nall of the alpha-elements by ~0.5 dex compared to the solar values. Such a low\n[alpha/Fe] can be produced by stochastical fluctuations in terms of an\nincomplete mixing of single Type Ia and II SNe events into the ISM.

This suggests that Carina's SF history varies with\nposition within the galaxy, with incomplete mixing. Alternatively, the SF rate\nis so low that the high-mass stellar IMF is sparsely populated, as\nstatistically expected in low-mass star clusters, leading to real scatter in\nthe resultant mass-integrated yields.

Abstract: We present evidence that the optically unidentified radio source, FIRST\nJ121839.7+295325, may be strongly lensing a background galaxy. We estimate the\nredshift of the assumed gravitational arc, discovered in parallel imaging with\nHST, from MMT-Blue Channel spectroscopy to be z_{arc}=2.48_-0.05^+0.14. We\npresent lens models with an Einstein radius of R_E=1.3\" which contains a mass\nof M_{dyn}=10^{12 +- 0.5} M_{sol}, where the uncertainty reflects the range of\npossible lens redshifts. The putative lens is not detected to J_{lim}=22.0 mag\nand H_{lim}=20.7 mag in our MMT-SWIRC imaging. Using the flux limits from WFPC2\nand SWIRC, we estimate that the dynamical mass-to-light ratio of\nJ121839.7+295325 is M_{dyn}/L_B >~ 10 M_sol/L_sol for A_V=1 mag, and this lower\nlimit could be as high as 30 M_sol/L_sol for A_V=0 mag. Since the radio source\nis optically unidentified (V_{lim}=25.5 mag) and has a radio flux of S_{1.4\nGHz}=33 mJy, it is likely a massive early-type galaxy which hosts a radio-loud\nAGN at 0.8<z<1.5. However, the present data cannot uniquely determine the\nmass-to-light ratio of the lensing galaxy, and hence the possibility that this\nsystem may be a reasonably dark lens is not ruled out. \n\n"}

We demonstrate that rapid (\\Delta\nz< 0.1-0.2), strong (\\Delta T > 10^4 K) photo-heating is difficult to achieve\nacross the entire IGM unless quasar spectra are significantly harder than\nimplied by current observational constraints. Although filtering of intrinsic\nquasar radiation through dense regions in the IGM does increase the mean excess\nenergy per HeII photo-ionisation, it also weakens the radiation intensity and\nlowers the photo-ionisation rate, preventing rapid heating over time intervals\nshorter than the local photo-ionisation timescale. Moreover, the hard photons\nresponsible for the strongest heating are more likely to deposit their energy\ninside dense clumps. The abundance of such clumps is, however, uncertain and\nmodel-dependent, leading to a fairly large uncertainty in the photo-heating\nrates. Nevertheless, although some of the IGM may be exposed to a hardened and\nweakened ionising background for long periods, most of the IGM must instead be\nreionised by the more abundant, softer photons and with accordingly modest\nheating rates (\\Delta T < 10^4 K). The repeated ionisation of fossil quasar\nHeIII regions does not increase the net heating because the recombination times\nin these regions typically exceed the IGM cooling times and the average time\nlag between successive rounds of quasar activity. Detailed line-of-sight\nradiative transfer simulations confirm these expectations and predict a rich\nthermal structure in the IGM during HeII reionisation. [Abridged] \n\n"}

This is\nparticularly motivated by recent indications from HYMORS. Exploiting high\nresolution, numerical simulations, we demonstrate that for both high and low\nenergy jets, always at high Lorentz factor, a transition to a higher density\nenvironment can cause a significant fraction of the directed jet energy to be\nlost on reflection. This can explain how one-sided jet deceleration and a\ntransition to FR I type can occur in HYMORS, which start as FR II (and remain\nso on the other side). For that purpose, we implemented in the relativistic\nhydrodynamic grid-adaptive AMRVAC code, the Synge-type equation of state\nintroduced in the general polytropic case by Meliani et al. (2004). We present\nresults for 10 model computations, varying the inlet Lorentz factor from 10 to\n20, including uniform or decreasing density profiles, and allowing for\ncylindrical versus conical jet models.

When the jet\nruns into a denser medium, we find a clear distinction in the decelaration of\nhigh energy jets depending on the encountered density jump. For fairly high\ndensity contrast, the jet becomes destabilised and compressed, decelerates\nstrongly (up to subrelativistic speeds) and can form knots.

The CMB alone favors a 3% (positively\ncorrelated) isocurvature contribution in both the flat and curved cases. The\nnon-adiabatic contribution to the observed CMB temperature variance is 0 <\nalpha_T < 7% at 98% CL in the curved case. In the flat case, combining the CMB\nwith SN data artificially biases the result towards the pure adiabatic LCDM\nconcordance model, whereas in the curved case the favored level of\nnon-adiabaticity stays at 3% level with all combinations of data. However, the\nratio of Bayes factors, or Delta ln(evidence), is more than 5 points in favor\nof the flat adiabatic LCDM model, which suggests that the inclusion of the 5\nextra parameters of the curved isocurvature model is not supported by the\ncurrent data. The results are very sensitive to the second and third acoustic\npeak regions in the CMB temperature angular power: therefore a careful\ncalibration of these data will be required before drawing decisive conclusions\non the nature of primordial perturbations. Finally, we point out that the odds\nfor the flat non-adiabatic model are 1:3 compared to the curved adiabatic\nmodel. This may suggest that it is not much less motivated to extend the\nconcordance model with 4 isocurvature degrees of freedom than it is to study\nthe spatially curved adiabatic model. \n\n"}

A large (~1200 km/s) velocity offset\nbetween the narrow and broad components of Hbeta has been measured in three\ndifferent optical spectra from the VLT/VIMOS and Magellan/IMACS instruments.\nCID-42 is also the only X-ray source having in its X-ray spectra a strong\nredshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing an\ninverted P-Cygni profile. The Chandra and XMM data show that the absorption\nline is variable in energy by 500 eV over 4 years and that the absorber has to\nbe highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft X-ray\nspectrum.

This\nbehaviour of the entropy perturbations is preserved even when the fields are\ncoupled via kinetic interaction. Since, for assisted dark energy, the\nsubdominant field in the early epoch becomes dominant at late time, the entropy\nperturbations can significantly influence the dynamics of density perturbations\nin the universe.

Both the\nintermittent and RRAT-like events are extremely rare and are preceded by a\nlarge amplitude glitch in the spin-down parameters. The post-glitch spin-down\nrate is smaller than the pre-glitch rate. This type of relaxation is very\nunusual for the pulsar population as a whole, but is observed in the glitch\nrecovery of a RRAT. The abnormal emission behaviour in PSR J1119-6127 was\nobserved up to three months after the epoch of the large glitch, suggestive of\nchanges in the magnetospheric conditions during the fast part of the recovery\nprocess. We argue that both the anomalous recoveries and the emission changes\ncould be related to reconfigurations of the magnetic field.

The\nkey ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on\nrelatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or\nlarger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a\nconfiguration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to\nsubstantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral\ngrazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic\nencounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the\nphotosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary\nstar increasing its own radius. This is motivated by the case of $\\eta$\nCarinae, where such a collision must have occured if conventional estimates of\nthe present-day orbit are correct, and where brief peaks in the light curve\ncoincide with periastron. Stellar collisions may explain brief recurring LBV\noutbursts like SN 2000ch and SN 2009ip, and perhaps outbursts from relatively\nlow-mass progenitor stars (collisons are not necessarily the exclusive domain\nof very luminous stars).

The moving hotspots are sandwiched between two shocks. An\ninner-facing shock receives momentum and cosmic rays from the jet and creates\nadditional cosmic rays that form a radio lobe elongated along the jet axis. An\nouter-facing bow shock moves directly into the undisturbed group or cluster\ngas, creating a cocoon of shocked gas enclosing the radio lobe. We describe\ncomputations that follow the self-consistent dynamical evolution of the shocked\ncluster gas and the relativistic synchrotron-emitting gas inside the lobes.\nRelativistic and non-relativistic components exchange momentum by interacting\nwith small magnetic fields having dynamically negligible energy densities.

Abstract: Recent publications claim that there is no convincing evidence for\nmeasurements of the baryonic acoustic (BAO) feature in galaxy samples using\neither monopole or radial information. Different claims seem contradictory:\ndata is either not consistent with the BAO model or data is consistent with\nboth the BAO model and featureless models without BAO. We investigate this\npoint with a set of 216 realistic mock galaxy catalogs extracted from MICE7680,\none of the largest volume dark matter simulation run to date, with a volume of\n1300 cubical gigaparsecs. Our mocks cover similar volume, densities and bias as\nthe real galaxies and provide 216 realizations of the Lambda or w=-1 Cold Dark\nMatter (wCDM) BAO model. We find that only 20% of the mocks show a\nstatistically significant (3 sigma) preference for the true (input) wCDM BAO\nmodel as compared to a featureless (non-physical) model without BAO. Thus the\nvolume of current galaxy samples is not yet large enough to claim that the BAO\nfeature has been detected. Does this mean that we can not locate the BAO\nposition? Using a simple (non optimal) algorithm we show that in 50% (100%) of\nthe mocks we can find the BAO position within 5% (20%) of the true value. These\ntwo findings are not in contradiction: the former is about model selection, the\nlater is about parameter fitting within a model. We conclude that current\nmonopole and radial BAO measurements can be used as standard rulers if we\nassume wCDM type of models. \n\n"}

These extra components contribute 10%-70% of the total\npolarized flux. This is the first time multiple RM components have been\nidentified in a large sample of point sources. For our observing configuration,\nthese extra RM components bias the measurement of the peak RM by 10-15 rad/m2 ;\nmore generally, the peak RM cannot be determined more precisely than the RM\nbeam size.

Abstract: Most, if not all, disk galaxies have a thin (classical) disk and a thick\ndisk. In most models thick disks are thought to be a necessary consequence of\nthe disk formation and/or evolution of the galaxy. We present the results of a\nstudy of the thick disk properties in a sample of carefully selected edge-on\ngalaxies with types ranging from T=3 to T=8. We fitted one-dimensional\nluminosity profiles with physically motivated functions - the solutions of two\nstellar and one gaseous isothermal coupled disks in equilibrium - which are\nlikely to yield more accurate results than other functions used in previous\nstudies. The images used for the fits come from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar\nStructure in Galaxies (S4G). We found that thick disks are on average more\nmassive than previously reported, mostly due to the selected fitting function.\nTypically, the thin and the thick disk have similar masses. We also found that\nthick disks do not flare significantly within the observed range in\ngalactocentric radii and that the ratio of thick to thin disk scaleheights is\nhigher for galaxies of earlier types.\n  Our results tend to favor an in situ origin for most of the stars in the\nthick disk. In addition the thick disk may contain a significant amount of\nstars coming from satellites accreted after the initial build-up of the galaxy\nand an extra fraction of stars coming from the secular heating of the thin disk\nby its own overdensities.\n  Assigning thick disk light to the thin disk component may lead to an\nunderestimate of the overall stellar mass in galaxies, because of different\nmass to light ratios in the two disk components. On the basis of our new\nresults, we estimate that disk stellar masses are between 10% and 50% higher\nthan previously thought and we suggest that thick disks are a reservoir of\n\"local missing baryons\". \n\n"}

This modification of transport processes is of vital importance for\na wide variety of astrophysical processes including cosmic ray transport,\ntransfer of heavy elements in the interstellar medium, star formation etc.\nDealing with these processes one should keep in mind that in realistic\nastrophysical conditions magnetized fluids are turbulent. In this review we\nsingle out a single transport process, namely, heat transfer and consider how\nit occurs in the presence of the magnetized turbulence. We show that the\nability of magnetic field lines to constantly change topology and connectivity\nis at the heart of the correct description of the 3D magnetic field\nstochasticity in turbulent fluids. This ability is ensured by fast magnetic\nreconnection in turbulent fluids and puts forward the concept of reconnection\ndiffusion at the core of the physical picture of heat transfer in astrophysical\nplasmas. Appealing to reconnection diffusion we describe the ability of plasma\nto diffuse between different magnetized eddies explaining the advection of the\nheat by turbulence. Adopting the structure of magnetic field that follows from\nthe modern understanding of MHD turbulence, we also discuss thermal\nconductivity that arises as electrons stream along stochastic magnetic field\nlines.

We confront\nthese models with both precision cosmological data (probing the CMB decoupling\nepoch) and light-element abundances (probing the BBN epoch). In the minimal\nLambdaCDM model, such sterile neutrinos are strongly disfavoured by current\ndata because they contribute too much hot dark matter. However, if the\ncosmological framework is extended to include also additional relativistic\ndegrees of freedom -- beyond the three standard neutrinos and the putative\nsterile neutrinos, then the hot dark matter constraint on the sterile states is\nconsiderably relaxed. A further improvement is achieved by allowing a dark\nenergy equation of state parameter w<-1. While BBN strongly disfavours extra\nradiation beyond the assumed eV-mass sterile neutrino, this constraint can be\ncircumvented by a small nu_e degeneracy. Any model containing eV-mass sterile\nneutrinos implies also strong modifications of other cosmological parameters.\nNotably, the inferred cold dark matter density can shift up by 20 to 75%\nrelative to the standard LambdaCDM value. \n\n"}

The problem of ion transport between the accelerating and\ninteraction sites must also be addressed to infer as much information as\npossible on the properties of the primary ion accelerator. In the last couple\nof decades, both theoretical and observational developments have led to\nsubstantial progress in understanding the origin of solar {\\gamma}-rays and\nneutrons. This chapter reviews recent developments in the study of solar\n{\\gamma}-rays and of solar neutrons at the time of the RHESSI era. The\nunprecedented quality of the RHESSI data reveals {\\gamma}-ray line shapes for\nthe first time and provides {\\gamma}-ray images. Our previous understanding of\nthe properties of energetic ions based on measurements from the former solar\ncycles is also summarized. The new results-obtained owing both to the gain in\nspectral resolution (both with RHESSI and with the non solar-dedicated\nINTEGRAL/SPI instrument) and to the pioneering imaging technique in the\n{\\gamma}-ray domain-are presented in the context of this previous knowledge.\nStill open questions are emphasized in the last section of the chapter and\nfuture perspectives on this field are briefly discussed. \n\n"}

We\nperform the first fully self-consistent Braginskii-MHD simulations of galaxy\nclusters including both of these effects. Specifically, we perform local and\nglobal simulations of the magnetothermal instability (MTI) and the\nheat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) and assess the effects of viscosity\non their saturation and astrophysical implications. We find that viscosity has\nonly a modest effect on the saturation of the MTI. As in previous calculations,\nwe find that the MTI can generate nearly sonic turbulent velocities in the\nouter parts of galaxy clusters, although viscosity somewhat suppresses the\nmagnetic field amplification. At smaller radii in cool-core clusters, viscosity\ncan decrease the linear growth rates of the HBI. However, it has less of an\neffect on the HBI's nonlinear saturation, in part because three-dimensional\ninterchange motions (magnetic flux tubes slipping past each other) are not\ndamped by anisotropic viscosity. In global simulations of cool core clusters,\nwe show that the HBI robustly inhibits radial thermal conduction and thus\nprecipitates a cooling catastrophe. The effects of viscosity are, however, more\nimportant for higher entropy clusters. We argue that viscosity can contribute\nto the global transition of cluster cores from cool-core to non cool-core\nstates: additional sources of intracluster turbulence, such as can be produced\nby AGN feedback or galactic wakes, suppress the HBI, heating the cluster core\nby thermal conduction; this makes the ICM more viscous, which slows the growth\nof the HBI, allowing further conductive heating of the cluster core and a\ntransition to a non cool-core state. \n\n"}

Abstract: The CO-H2 conversion factor (Xco; otherwise known as the X-factor) is\nobserved to be remarkably constant in the Milky Way and in the Local Group\n(aside from the SMC). To date, our understanding of why Xco should be so\nconstant remains poor. Using a combination of extremely high resolution (~ 1\npc) galaxy evolution simulations and molecular line radiative transfer\ncalculations, we suggest that Xco displays a narrow range of values in the\nGalaxy due to the fact that molecular clouds share very similar physical\nproperties. In our models, this is itself a consequence of stellar feedback\ncompeting against gravitational collapse. GMCs whose lifetimes are regulated by\nradiative feedback show a narrow range of surface densities, temperatures and\nvelocity dispersions with values comparable to those seen in the Milky Way. As\na result, the X-factors from these clouds show reasonable correspondence with\nobserved data from the Local Group, and a relatively narrow range. On the other\nhand, feedback-free clouds collapse to surface densities that are larger than\nthose seen in the Galaxy, and hence result in X-factors that are systematically\ntoo large compared to the Milky Way's. We conclude that radiative feedback\nwithin GMCs can generate cloud properties similar to those observed in the\nGalaxy, and hence a roughly constant Milky Way X-factor in normal, quiescent\nclouds. \n\n"}

Correction to\n  Goldreich's dynamical model Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling is often described in the \"MacDonald torque\" approach\nwhich has become the textbook standard. Within this method, a concise\nexpression for the additional tidal potential, derived by MacDonald (1964; Rev.\nGeophys. 2, 467), is combined with an assumption that the Q factor is\nfrequency-independent (i.e., that the geometric lag angle is constant in time).\nThis makes the approach unphysical because MacDonald's derivation of the said\nformula was implicitly based on keeping the time lag frequency-independent,\nwhich is equivalent to setting Q to scale as the inverse tidal frequency. The\ncontradiction requires the MacDonald treatment of both non-resonant and\nresonant rotation to be rewritten.\n  The non-resonant case was reconsidered by Efroimsky & Williams (2009; CMDA\n104, 257), in application to spin modes distant from the major\ncommensurabilities. We continue this work by introducing the necessary\nalterations into the MacDonald-torque-based model of falling into a 1:1\nresonance. (For the original version of the model, see Goldreich 1966; AJ 71,\n1.)\n  We also study the effect of the triaxiality on both circulating and librating\nrotation near the synchronous state. Circulating rotation may evolve toward the\nlibration region or toward a spin rate larger than synchronous\n(pseudosynchronous spin). Which behaviour depends on the eccentricity, the\ntriaxiality of the primary, and the mass ratio of the secondary and primary\nbodies. The spin evolution will always stall for the oblate case. For\nsmall-amplitude librations, expressions are derived for the libration\nfrequency, damping rate, and average orientation.\n  However, the stability of pseudosynchronous spin hinges upon the dissipation\nmodel. Makarov and Efroimsky (2012; arXiv:1209.1616) have found that a more\nrealistic dissipation model than the corrected MacDonald torque makes\npseudosynchronous spin unstable. \n\n"}

Magnetic reconnection in this current sheet\ninevitably dissipates a nontrivial fraction of the pulsar spin-down power\nwithin a few LC radii. We develop a basic physical picture of reconnection in\nthis environment and discuss its implications for the observed pulsed gamma-ray\nemission. We argue that reconnection proceeds in the plasmoid-dominated regime,\nvia an hierarchical chain of multiple secondary islands/flux ropes. The\ninter-plasmoid reconnection layers are subject to strong synchrotron cooling,\nleading to significant plasma compression. Using the conditions of pressure\nbalance across these current layers, the balance between the heating by\nmagnetic energy dissipation and synchrotron cooling, and Ampere's law, we\nobtain simple estimates for key parameters of the layers --- temperature,\ndensity, and layer thickness. In the comoving frame of the relativistic pulsar\nwind just outside of the equatorial current sheet, these basic parameters are\nuniquely determined by the strength of the reconnecting upstream magnetic\nfield. For the case of the Crab pulsar, we find them to be of order 10 GeV,\n$10^{13} cm^{-3}$, and 10 cm, respectively.

I:\n  Hydrodynamics Abstract: We use 3D hydrodynamical models to investigate the effects of massive star\nfeedback from winds and supernovae on inhomogeneous molecular material left\nover from the formation of a massive stellar cluster. We simulate the\ninteraction of the mechanical energy input from a cluster with 3 O-stars into a\ngiant molecular cloud (GMC) clump containing 3240 solar masses of molecular\nmaterial within a 4 pc radius. The cluster wind blows out of the molecular\nclump along low-density channels, into which denser clump material is\nentrained. We find that the densest molecular regions are surprisingly\nresistant to ablation by the cluster wind, in part due to shielding by other\ndense regions closer to the cluster. Nonetheless, molecular material is\ngradually removed by the cluster wind during which mass-loading factors in\nexcess of several 100 are obtained. Because the clump is very porous, 60-75 per\ncent of the injected wind energy escapes the simulation domain, with the\ndifference being radiated. After 4.4 Myr, the massive stars in our simulation\nbegin to explode as supernovae. The highly structured environment into which\nthe SN energy is released allows even weaker coupling to the remaining dense\nmaterial and practically all of the SN energy reaches the wider environment.\nThe molecular material is almost completely dispersed and destroyed after 6\nMyr. The escape fraction of ionizing radiation is estimated to be about 50 per\ncent during the first 4 Myr of the cluster's life. A similar model with a\nlarger and more massive GMC clump reveals the same general picture, though more\ntime is needed for it to be destroyed. \n\n"}

Our goal is to trace evidence of an age metallicity\nrelation (AMR) and correlate it with the mutual interactions of the two MCs.\nOur aim is also to correlate the AMR with the spatial distribution of the\nclusters. In the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the majority of the selected\nclusters are young (up to 1 Gyr) and our aim is to search for an AMR at this\nepoch which has not been much studied. Methods: We report on results for 15 LMC\nand 8 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) clusters, scattered all over the area of\nthese galaxies, to cover a wide spatial distribution and metallicity range. The\nselected LMC clusters were observed with the 1.54m Danish Telescope in Chile,\nusing the Danish Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (DFOSC) with a single\n2kx2k CCD, whereas the SMC clusters were observed with the ESO 3.6m Telescope\nalso in Chile with the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (EFOSC).

In this model Planck data determine the\ncosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble\nconstant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density\nparameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement\nwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including\ncurvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to\npercent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an\nanalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets\nin addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are\nfavoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral\nindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes\nin the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95% upper limit of r<0.11 on\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like\nrelativistic particles.

This work is motivated by the\ninsufficiently understood observed consequences of the H-ingestion flash in\npost-AGB stars (Sakurai's object) and metal-poor AGB stars. Our investigation\nis focused on the entrainment process at the top convection boundary and on the\nsubsequent advection of H-rich material into deeper layers, and we therefore\nignore the burning of the proton-rich fuel in this study. We find that, for our\ndeep convection zone, coherent convective motions of near global scale appear\nto dominate the flow. At the top boundary convective shear flows are stable\nagainst Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. However, such shear instabilities are\ninduced by the boundary-layer separation in large-scale, opposing flows.

The difference between the\nforward shock emission in a wind-type and a constant-density medium is also\nstudied, and the emission due to Maxwellian electron injection is compared to\nthe case with pure power-law electrons. The code calculates the time-evolving\nphoton and electron distributions in the emission region by solving the\nrelativistic kinetic equations for each particle species. For the first time,\nthe full relativistic equations for synchrotron emission/absorption, Compton\nscattering, and pair production/annihilation were applied to model the forward\nshock emission. The synchrotron self-absorption thermalization mechanism, which\nshapes the low-energy end of the electron distribution, was also included in\nthe electron equation.

(2004) spanning the range $100^{\\circ}<l<160^{\\circ}$ and\n$-50^{\\circ}<b<-15^{\\circ}$ but, in addition, a second, brighter and more\ndensely populated M giant sequence. These two sequences are likely associated\nwith the two distinct main-sequences discovered (and labeled TriAnd1 and\nTriAnd2) by Martin et al. (2007) in an optical survey in the direction of M31,\nwhere TriAnd2 is the optical counterpart of the fainter RGB/AGB sequence of\nRocha-Pinto et al. (2004). Here, the age, distance, and metallicity ranges for\nTriAnd1 and TriAnd2 are estimated by simultaneously fitting isochrones to the\n2MASS RGB tracks and the optical MS/MSTO features. The two populations are\nclearly distinct in age and distance: the brighter sequence (TriAnd1) is\nyounger (6-10 Gyr) and closer (distance of $\\sim$ 15-21 kpc), while the fainter\nsequence (TriAnd2) is older (10-12 Gyr) and is at an estimated distance of\n$\\sim$ 24-32 kpc. A comparison with simulations demonstrates that the\ndifferences and similarities between TriAnd1 and TriAnd2 can simultaneously be\nexplained if they represent debris originating from the disruption of the same\ndwarf galaxy, but torn off during two distinct pericentric passages.

A possible channel for producing such\nmisaligned hot Jupiters involves Lidov-Kozai oscillations of the planet's\norbital eccentricity and inclination driven by a distant binary companion. In a\nrecent work (Storch, Anderson & Lai 2014), we have shown that a proto-hot\nJupiter undergoing Lidov-Kozai oscillations can induce complex, and often\nchaotic, evolution of the spin axis of its host star. Here we explore the\norigin of the chaotic spin behavior and its various features in an idealized\nnon-dissipative system where the secular oscillations of the planet's orbit are\nstrictly periodic. Using Hamiltonian perturbation theory, we identify a set of\nsecular spin-orbit resonances in the system, and show that overlaps of these\nresonances are responsible for the onset of wide-spread chaos in the evolution\nof stellar spin axis. The degree of chaos in the system depends on the\nadiabaticity parameter $\\epsilon$, proportional to the ratio of the Lidov-Kozai\nnodal precession rate and the stellar spin precession rate, and thus depends on\nthe planet mass, semi-major axis and the stellar rotation rate.

Finally, we discuss a novel \"adiabatic\nresonance advection\" phenomenon, in which the spin-orbit misalignment, trapped\nin a resonance, gradually evolves as the adiabaticity parameter slowly changes.\nThis phenomenon can occur for certain parameter regimes when tidal decay of the\nplanetary orbit is included. \n\n"}

In this\npaper we show how these effects can be used to reliably switch perpendicularly\nmagnetized layers and to move domain walls. A drift-diffusion treatment of the\nanomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic magnetoresistance describes the spin\ncurrents that flow in directions perpendicular to the electric field. In\nsystems with two ferromagnetic layers separated by a spacer layer, an in-plane\nelectric field cause spin currents to be injected from one layer into the\nother, creating spin transfer torques. Unlike the related spin Hall effect in\nnon-magnetic materials, the anomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance allow control of the orientation of the injected spins, and\nhence torques, by changing the direction of the magnetization in the injecting\nlayer. The torques on one layer show a rich angular dependence as a function of\nthe orientation of the magnetization in the other layer. The control of the\ntorques afforded by changing the orientation of the magnetization in a fixed\nlayer makes it possible to reliably switch a perpendicularly magnetized free\nlayer.

To\nensure robust photometric redshift solutions, and to minimize incompleteness,\nwe confine our search to objects with H_{160} < 28.6 (AB mag), consider only\nimage regions with an rms noise sigma_{160} > 30 mag (within a 0.5-arcsec\ndiameter aperture), and insist on detections in both H_{160} and J_{140}. The\nresult is a survey covering an effective area (after accounting for\nmagnification) of 10.9 sq. arcmin, which yields 12 galaxies at 8.4 < z < 9.5.\nWithin the Abell-2744 cluster and parallel fields we confirm the three\nbrightest objects reported by Ishigaki et al. (2014), but recover only one of\nthe four z > 8.4 sources reported by Zheng et al. (2014). In the\nMACSJ0416.1-240 cluster field we report five objects, and explain why each of\nthese eluded detection or classification as z ~ 9 galaxies in the published\nsearches of the shallower CLASH data. Finally, we uncover four z ~ 9 galaxies\nfrom the previously unsearched MACSJ0416.1-240 parallel field. Based on the\npublished magnification maps we find that only one of these 12 galaxies is\nlikely boosted by more than a factor of two by gravitational lensing.\nConsequently we are able to perform a fairly straightforward reanalysis of the\nnormalization of the z ~ 9 UV galaxy luminosity function as explored previously\nin the HUDF12 programme. We conclude that the new data strengthen the evidence\nfor a continued smooth decline in UV luminosity density (and hence\nstar-formation rate density) from z ~ 8 to z ~ 9, contrary to recent reports of\na marked drop-off at these redshifts.

For example, Lasota & King argued that the\nbrightest known ULX (HLX-1) is a regular binary system with a rather low-mass\ncompact object (a stellar-origin black hole or a neutron star). The predicted\nformation efficiencies and lifetimes of binaries with the very high mass\ntransfer rates are large enough to explain all observed systems with extreme\nX-ray luminosities.

We aim to\ncharacterize the impact of possible accretion variations in a sample of\nembedded protostars by measuring the size of the inner regions of their\nenvelopes where CO is sublimated and relate those to their temperature profiles\ndictated by their current luminosities. Using observations from the\nSubmillimeter Array we measure the extents of the emission from the C18O\nisotopologue toward 16 deeply embedded protostars. We compare these\nmeasurements to the predicted extent of the emission given the current\nluminosities of the sources through dust and line radiative transfer\ncalculations. Eight out of sixteen sources show more extended C18O emission\nthan predicted by the models. The modeling shows that the likely culprit for\nthese signatures is sublimation due to increases in luminosities of the sources\nby about a factor five or more during the recent 10,000 years - the time it\ntakes for CO to freeze-out again on dust grains.

Classical asperity theories predict, in agreement\nwith experimental observations, that adhesion is always destroyed by roughness\nexcept if the amplitude of the same is extremely small, and the materials are\nparticularly soft. This happens for all fractal dimensions. However, these\ntheories are limited due to the geometrical simplification, which may be\nparticularly strong in conditions near full contact. We introduce therefore a\nsimple model for adhesion, which aims at being rigorous near full contact,\nwhere we postulate there are only small isolated gaps between the two bodies.\nThe gaps can be considered as \"pressurized cracks\" by using Ken Johnson's idea\nof searching a corrective solution to the full contact solution. The solution\nis an extension of the adhesive-less solution proposed recently by Xu, Jackson,\nand Marghitu (XJM model) (2014). This process seems to confirm recent theories\nusing the JKR theory, namely that the effect of adhesion depends critically on\nthe fractal dimension. For D<2.5, the case which includes the vast majority of\nnatural surfaces, there is an expected strong effect of adhesion. Only for\nlarge fractal dimensions, D>2.5, seems for large enough magnifications that a\nfull fractal roughness completely destroys adhesion. These results are partly\nparadoxical since strong adhesion is not observed in nature except in special\ncases. A possible way out of the paradox may be that the conclusion is relevant\nfor the near full contact regime, where the strong role of flaws at the\ninterfaces, and of gaps full of contaminant, trapped air or liquid in pressure,\nneeds to be further explored.

This is\ninvoked in order to have enough material processed through first generation\nstars in order to form the observed numbers of enriched stars (inferred to be\nsecond generation stars in these models). If such mass loss was due to tidal\nstripping, gas expulsion, or tidal interaction with the birth environment,\nthere should be clear correlations between the fraction of enriched stars and\nother cluster properties, whereas the observations show a remarkably uniform\nenriched fraction of $0.68\\pm0.07$ (from 33 observed GCs). If interpreted in\nthe heavy mass loss paradigm, this means that all GCs lost the same fraction of\ntheir initial mass (between $95-98$\\%), regardless of their mass, metallicity,\nlocation at birth or subsequent migration, or epoch of formation. This is\nincompatible with predictions, hence we suggest that GCs were not significantly\nmore massive at birth, and that the fraction of enriched to primordial stars\nobserved in clusters today likely reflects their initial value.

Although\nthis is traditionally justified using perturbation theory, it can be viewed as\narising from a momentum balance argument that examines the response of the\nground state to the insertion of a single flux quantum [M. Oshikawa, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 84, 3370 (2000)]. This reveals that the Fermi sea volume is a\ntopologically protected quantity. Extending this approach, I show that spinless\nor spin-rotation-preserving fermionic systems in non-symmorphic crystals\npossess generalized topological 'Luttinger invariants' that can be nonzero even\nin cases where the Fermi sea volume vanishes. A nonzero Luttinger invariant\nthen forces energy bands to touch, leading to semimetals whose gaplessness is\nthus rooted in topology; opening a gap without symmetry breaking automatically\ntriggers fractionalization. The existence of these invariants is linked to the\ninability of non-symmorphic crystals to host band insulating ground states\nexcept at special fillings.

By comparing the response to a two-dimensional\nmicrostructure it is observed that the response is qualitatively similar (both\nmacroscopically and microscopically).

Coronal loops are often modeled as a collection\nof individual strands, in order to explain their thermal behaviour and\nappearance. We perform 3D ideal MHD simulations to study the effect of a\ncontinuous small amplitude transverse footpoint driving on the internal\nstructure of a coronal loop composed of strands. The output is also converted\nto synthetic images, corresponding to the AIA 171 A and 193 A passbands, using\nFoMo.

The final product of our simulation is mixed loop with density\nstructures on a large range of scales, resembling a power-law. Thus,\nmulti-stranded loops are unstable to driving by transverse waves, and this\nraises a strong doubt on the usability and applicability of coronal loop models\nconsisting of independent strands. \n\n"}

In our model angular momentum and mass are transported by a\ncombination of gravitational and bar-driven acoustic instabilities. In\ngravitationally-unstable regions the gas can form stars, and the resulting\nfeedback drives both turbulence and a wind that ejects mass from the CMZ. We\nshow that the CMZ is in a quasi-steady state where mass deposited at large\nradii by the bar is transported inward to a star-forming, ring-shaped region at\n$\\sim 100$ pc from the Galactic Centre, where the shear reaches a minimum. This\nring undergoes episodic starbursts, with bursts lasting $\\sim 5-10$ Myr\noccurring at $\\sim 20-40$ Myr intervals. During quiescence the gas in the ring\nis not fully cleared, but is driven out of a self-gravitating state by the\nmomentum injected by expanding supernova remnants. Starbursts also drive a wind\noff the star-forming ring, with a time-averaged mass flux comparable to the\nstar formation rate.

Rather than constructing noise simulations, we eliminate the GWB\nspatial correlations in the true datasets to assess detection significance with\nall real data features intact.

To\nexplain these observations Bastian et al. suggested a scenario in which a\nsecond population is formed by the accretion of enriched material onto the\nlow-mass stars in the initial GC population. The idea is that the low-mass,\npre-main sequence stars sweep up gas expelled by the massive stars of the same\ngeneration into their protoplanetary disc as they move through the GC core. We\nperform simulations with 2 different smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes to\ninvestigate if a low-mass star surrounded by a protoplanetary disc can accrete\nthe amount of enriched material required in this scenario. We focus on the gas\nloading rate onto the disc and star as well as on the lifetime of the disc. We\nfind that the gas loading rate is a factor of 2 smaller than the geometric\nrate, because the effective cross section of the disc is smaller than its\nsurface area. The loading rate is consistent for both codes, irrespective of\nresolution. The disc gains mass in the high resolution runs, but loses angular\nmomentum on a time scale of 10^4 yrs. Two effects determine the loss of\n(specific) angular momentum in our simulations: 1) continuous ram pressure\nstripping and 2) accretion of material with no azimuthal angular momentum. Our\nstudy and previous work suggest that the former, dominant process is mainly\ncaused by numerical rather than physical effects, while the latter is not. The\nlatter process causes the disc to become more compact, increasing the surface\ndensity profile at smaller radii. The disc size is determined in the first\nplace by the ram pressure when the flow first hits the disc. Further evolution\nis governed by the decrease in the specific angular momentum of the disc. We\nconclude that the size and lifetime of the disc are probably not sufficient to\naccrete the amount of mass required in Bastian et al.'s scenario. \n\n"}

Our\nsimultaneous Nustar/Swift observations show that the 0.5-79 keV spectrum can be\ndescribed by a combination of a power law with a photon index of Gamma~2, a\nblack body with a temperature of kT_bb~0.5 keV (presumably arising from the\nneutron star surface), and disk reflection. Modeling the reflection spectrum\nsuggests that the inner accretion disk was located at R_in>100 GM/c2 (>225 km)\nfrom the neutron star. The apparent truncation may be due to evaporation of the\ninner disk into a radiatively-inefficient accretion flow, or due to the\npressure of the neutron star magnetic field.

However, using a low-acceleration rocket would require several\nhundreds of thousands of years to reach these star systems, with minimal time\ndilation effects since maximum velocities only reached about 0.2c. Such transit\ntimes are clearly impractical, and thus, any kind of colonisation using low\nacceleration rockets would be difficult. High accelerations, on the order of\n1g, are likely required to complete interstellar journeys within a reasonable\ntime frame, though they may require prohibitively large amounts of fuel. So for\nnow, it appears that humanity's ultimate goal of a galactic empire may only be\npossible at significantly higher accelerations, though the propulsion\ntechnology requirement for a journey that uses realistic amounts of fuel\nremains to be determined. \n\n"}

It enables us to relate the spectral function for gravitational\nwaves and the distribution function for quantum gravitational fluctuations and\nto indeed introduce a new spectral function for the zero-point fluctuations of\nspacetime. The formulation is applied to two-level identical bosonic atoms in\nan off-resonant high-$Q$ cavity that effectively inhibits undesirable\nelectromagnetic delays, leading to a gravitational transition mechanism through\ncertain quadrupole moment operators.

{"id": "1702.04358", "contents": "Title: Emergent gravity in galaxies and in the Solar System Abstract: It was recently proposed that the effects usually attributed to particle dark\nmatter on galaxy scales are due to the displacement of dark energy by baryonic\nmatter, a paradigm known as emergent gravity. This formalism leads to\npredictions similar to Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in spherical\nsymmetry, but not quite identical. In particular, it leads to a well defined\ntransition between the Newtonian and the modified gravitational regimes, a\ntransition depending on both the Newtonian acceleration and its first\nderivative with respect to radius. Under the hypothesis of the applicability of\nthis transition to aspherical systems, we investigate whether it can reproduce\nobserved galaxy rotation curves. We conclude that the formula leads to\nmarginally acceptable fits with strikingly low best-fit distances, low stellar\nmass-to-light ratios, and a low Hubble constant. In particular, some unobserved\nwiggles are produced in rotation curves because of the dependence of the\ntransition on the derivative of the Newtonian acceleration, leading, even in\nthe most favorable case, to systematically less good fits than MOND. Then,\napplying the predicted transition from emergent gravity in a regime where it\nshould a priori be applicable, i.e. in spherical symmetry and outside of the\nbulk of matter, we show that the predictions for the secular advances of Solar\nSystem planets' perihelia are discrepant with the data by seven orders of\nmagnitude, ruling out the present emergent gravity weak-field formula with high\nconfidence. \n\n"}

These are dark matter halo\nabundance at high redshifts, satellite galaxy abundance in the Milky Way, and\nfluctuation in the 21-cm radiation background before the epoch of reionization.\nThe thermal inflation scenario leaves a characteristic signature on the matter\npower spectrum by boosting the amplitude at a specific wavenumber determined by\nthe number of e-foldings during thermal inflation ($N_{\\rm bc}$), and strongly\nsuppressing the amplitude for modes at smaller scales. For a reasonable range\nof parameter space, one of the consequences is the suppression of minihalo\nformation at high redshifts and that of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way.\nWhile this effect is substantial, it is degenerate with other cosmological or\nastrophysical effects.

Because the Alfv\\'en speed\nvaries with distance from the disk, the AWs undergo partial non-WKB reflection,\nand counter-propagating AWs subsequently interact, causing AW energy to cascade\nto small scales and dissipate. To investigate this process, we introduce an\nElsasser-like formulation of general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) and develop the\ntheory of general relativistic reduced MHD in an inhomogeneous medium. We then\nderive a set of equations for the mean-square AW amplitude $M_+$ and turbulent\nheating rate $Q$ under the assumption that, in the plasma rest frame, AWs\npropagating away from the disk are much more energetic than AWs propagating\ntoward the disk. For the case in which the background flow is axisymmetric and\ntime-independent, we solve these equations analytically to determine $M_+$ and\n$Q$ as functions of position. We find that, for an idealized thin disk threaded\nby a large-scale poloidal magnetic field, the AW energy flux is $\\sim\n(\\rho_{\\rm b}/\\rho_{\\rm d})^{1/2} \\beta_{\\rm net,d}^{-1/2}$ times the disk's\nradiative flux, where $\\rho_{\\rm b}$ and $\\rho_{\\rm d}$ are the mass densities\nat the coronal base and disk midplane, respectively, and $\\beta_{\\rm net,d}$ is\nthe ratio (evaluated at the disk midplane) of plasma-plus-radiation pressure to\nthe pressure of the average vertical magnetic field.

Abstract: The first direct detection of the asteroidal YORP effect, a phenomenon that\nchanges the spin states of small bodies due to thermal reemission of sunlight\nfrom their surfaces, was obtained for (54509) YORP 2000 PH5. Such an alteration\ncan slowly increase the rotation rate of asteroids, driving them to reach their\nfission limit and causing their disruption. This process can produce binaries\nand unbound asteroid pairs. Secondary fission opens the door to the eventual\nformation of transient but genetically-related groupings. Here, we show that\nthe small near-Earth asteroid (NEA) 2017 FZ2 was a co-orbital of our planet of\nthe quasi-satellite type prior to their close encounter on 2017 March 23.\nBecause of this flyby with the Earth, 2017 FZ2 has become a non-resonant NEA.\nOur N-body simulations indicate that this object may have experienced\nquasi-satellite engagements with our planet in the past and it may return as a\nco-orbital in the future. We identify a number of NEAs that follow similar\npaths, the largest named being YORP, which is also an Earth's co-orbital. An\napparent excess of NEAs moving in these peculiar orbits is studied within the\nframework of two orbit population models. A possibility that emerges from this\nanalysis is that such an excess, if real, could be the result of mass shedding\nfrom YORP itself or a putative larger object that produced YORP. Future\nspectroscopic observations of 2017 FZ2 during its next visit in 2018 (and of\nrelated objects when feasible) may be able to confirm or reject this\ninterpretation. \n\n"}

The Planck Multi-frequency Catalogue\n  of Non-thermal Sources Abstract: This paper presents the Planck Multi-frequency Catalogue of Non-thermal (i.e.\nsynchrotron-dominated) Sources (PCNT) observed between 30 and 857 GHz by the\nESA Planck mission. This catalogue was constructed by selecting objects\ndetected in the full mission all-sky temperature maps at 30 and 143 GHz, with a\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N)>3 in at least one of the two channels after\nfiltering with a particular Mexican hat wavelet. As a result, 29400 source\ncandidates were selected. Then, a multi-frequency analysis was performed using\nthe Matrix Filters methodology at the position of these objects, and flux\ndensities and errors were calculated for all of them in the nine Planck\nchannels. The present catalogue is the first unbiased, full-sky catalogue of\nsynchrotron-dominated sources published at millimetre and submillimetre\nwavelengths and constitutes a powerful database for statistical studies of\nnon-thermal extragalactic sources, whose emission is dominated by the central\nactive galactic nucleus. Together with the full multi-frequency catalogue, we\nalso define the Bright Planck Multi-frequency Catalogue of Non-thermal Sources\nPCNTb, where only those objects with a S/N>4 at both 30 and 143 GHz were\nselected. In this catalogue 1146 compact sources are detected outside the\nadopted Planck GAL070 mask; thus, these sources constitute a highly reliable\nsample of extragalactic radio sources.

Since the amount of ionized material is controlled by the\ndynamics of the reverse shock, we find the DM changes more slowly than in\nprevious simpler work, which simply assumed a constant ionization fraction.\nFurthermore, the DM can be constant or even increasing as the supernova remnant\nsweeps up material, arguing that a young neutron star hypothesis for FRBs is\nnot ruled out if the DM is not decreasing over repeated bursts.

These regions\nare spatially associated with far-infrared emission peaks in a cold dust cloud\nidentified using Herschel and Spitzer data, and there may be a mismatch between\nthe low temperature of the dust and the expected heating effect of young stars.\nWe use integral-field optical spectroscopy to trace the ratios of strong\nemission lines.

Since the axion condensate is coherently oscillating, it\ncan conceivably lead to parametric resonance of photons, leading to exponential\ngrowth in photon occupancy number and subsequent radio wave emission. We show\nthat while resonance always exists for spatially homogeneous condensates, its\nexistence for a spatially localized clump condensate depends sensitively on the\nsize of clump, strength of axion-photon coupling, and field amplitude.

They can be\nvery competitive with those obtained from space, with the huge advantage of the\nflexibility of the instrumentation thanks to the direct access to the\ntelescope. In this contribution we leverage deep learning techniques to\nsignificantly accelerate the blind deconvolution process and produce corrected\nimages at a peak rate of ~100 images per second. We present two different\narchitectures that produce excellent image corrections with noise suppression\nwhile maintaining the photometric properties of the images. As a consequence,\npolarimetric signals can be obtained with standard polarimetric modulation\nwithout any significant artifact. With the expected improvements in computer\nhardware and algorithms, we anticipate that on-site real-time correction of\nsolar images will be possible in the near future. \n\n"}

While sophisticated\ntechniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy have become\npopular to map the energy-momentum relation, the transport experiments lack any\ndirect confirmation of Dirac and Weyl fermions in a system.

When the NV$^-$ - N$^+$ pair separation is large the properties\nof the pair will be as for single sites and a high degree of spin polarization\nattainable. When the separation decreases the emission is reduced, the lifetime\nshortened and the spin polarization downgraded. The deterioration occurs as a\nconsequence of electron tunneling in the excited state from NV$^-$ to N$^+$ and\nresults in an optical cycle that includes NV$^0$. The tunneling process is\nlinear in optical excitation and more prevalent the closer the N$^+$ is to the\nNV$^-$ centre. However, the separation between the NV$^-$ and its donor N$^+$\ncan be effected by light through the excitation of NV$^-$ and/or ionization of\nN$^0$. The optical excitation that creates the spin polarization can also\nmodify the sample properties and during excitation creates charge dynamics.

Here we\nperform N-body simulations of the moons' orbital evolution from various initial\nconditions -- assuming that the moons were formed from Saturn's hypothetical\nmassive ring -- and investigate possible paths to solve the above difficulties.\nIf the influence of the rings is neglected, we find that the Tethys-Dione pair\ncannot avoid becoming trapped in the mean-motion resonances as they recede from\nSaturn, and that the Tethys-Enceladus pair cannot avoid collisions after the\nresonance trapping, in case Saturn's quality factor is smaller than 15,000.\nThese findings are inconsistent with the current orbital configuration.\nHowever, taking into account both the eccentricity excitation and the orbital\nexpansion caused by the ring torque, we find that these resonance captures are\navoided. With the high eccentricity pumped up by the torque, Enceladus passes\nthrough the resonances with Tethys, and the Dione-Tethys pair passes through\ntheir 2:1 and possibly the 3:2 resonance as well.

These states showed up as distinct branches in the color-color\ndiagram, forming a structure with a comb-like topology; the soft state branch\nforming the spine and the hard state branches forming the teeth. Variability\nwas strongly correlated with the position on the branches. The broad band noise\nbecame stronger, and changed from power law like to band limited, as the\nspectrum became harder. Three types of QPOs were found: 1-18 Hz and 102-284 Hz\nQPOs on the hard branches, and 16-18 Hz QPOs on and near the soft branch. The\nfrequencies of the high and low frequency QPOs on the hard branches were\ncorrelated with each other, and anti-correlated with spectral hardness.

We explore a variety of approaches for modelling the\nradial distribution of the cold neutral gas associated with the galaxies in our\nmodels, and find that our results are very sensitive to this ingredient. If we\nuse an approach based on Fall & Efstathiou (1980), in which the sizes of the\ndiscs are determined by conservation of angular momentum, we find that the\nmajority of the DLAS correspond to a single galactic disc.

The more\ninteresting issue concerning the mass function is certainly to probe its low\nmass end. However due to the source confusion, even if the distribution and the\nkinematics of the lenses are known, the estimation of the mass function is\nextremely biased at low masses. The blending due to the source confusion biases\nthe duration of the event, which in turn dramatically biases the estimation of\nthe mass of the lens. To overcome this problem we propose to use differential\nphotometry of the microlensing events obtained using the image subtraction\nmethod. Differential photometry is free of any bias due to blending, however\nthe drawback of differential photometry is that the baseline flux is unknown.\nIn this paper we will show that even without knowing the baseline flux, purely\ndifferential photometry allow to estimate the mass function without any biases.\nThe basis of the method is that taking the scalar product of the microlensing\nlight curves with a given function and taking its sum over all the microlensing\nevents is equivalent to project the mass function on another function. This\nmethod demonstrates that there is a direct correspondancy between the space of\nthe observations and the space of the mass function.

The gravitational potential\nof the stellar disk was derived from near-infrared photometry, color-corrected\nto constant (M/L); the dark halo was modelled by an isothermal sphere with a\ncore. Hydrodynamic gas simulations were performed for each galaxy for a\nsequence of five different mass fractions of the stellar disk and for a wide\nrange of spiral pattern speeds.

The technique of speckle decorrelation involves\nintroducing many independent realizations of additional phase error into a\nwavefront during one speckle lifetime, changing the instantaneous speckle\npattern. A commonly held assumption is that this results in the speckles being\n`moved around' at the rate at which the additional phase screens are applied.\nThe intention of this exercise is to smooth the speckles out into a more\nuniform background distribution during their persistence time, thereby enabling\ncompanion detection around bright stars to be photon noise limited rather than\nspeckle-limited. We demonstrate analytically why this does not occur, and\nconfirm this result with numerical simulations.

This interpretation is hampered by the difficulty of\ndisentangling the disc and dark halo contributions from the disc dynamics of\nLSB galaxies. Recently, Fuchs (2002) has attempted such a disentanglement using\nspiral arm density wave and swing amplification theory, allowing an independent\nmeasurement of the disc mass; this work suggests that LSB discs are\nsignificantly more massive than previously believed.

The masses of subhaloes at their time of accretion are\nobtained from a standard merger tree. During the subsequent evolution, the\nsubhaloes experience mass loss due to the combined effect of dynamical\nfriction, tidal stripping, and tidal heating. Rather than integrating these\neffects along individual subhalo orbits, we consider the average mass loss\nrate, where the average is taken over all possible orbital configurations. This\nallows us to write the average mass loss rate as a simple function that depends\nonly on redshift and on the instantaneous mass ratio of subhalo and parent\nhalo. After calibrating the model by matching the subhalo mass function (SHMF)\nof cluster-sized dark matter haloes obtained from numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the predicted mass and redshift dependence of the SHMF.We find\nthat, contrary to previous claims, the subhalo mass function is not universal.\nInstead, both the slope and the normalization depend on the ratio of the parent\nhalo mass, M, and the characteristic non-linear mass M*. This simply reflects a\nhalo formation time dependence; more massive parent haloes form later, thus\nallowing less time for mass loss to operate. We analyze the halo-to-halo\nscatter, and show that the subhalo mass fraction of individual haloes depends\nmost strongly on their accretion history in the last Gyr.

A\nkey characteristic of this statistical energization mechanism is the absence of\na momentum scale; astrophysical systems generally only impose scales at the\ninjection (low energy) and loss (high energy) ends of the particle spectrum.\nThe existence of structure in the cosmic ray spectrum (the \"knee\") at around\n3000 TeV has promoted contentions that there are at least two origins for\ncosmic rays, a galactic one supplying those up to the knee, and even beyond,\nand perhaps an extragalactic one that can explain even the ultra-high energy\ncosmic rays (UHECRs) seen at 1-300 EeV.

We compute it explicitly for the Peebles-Young distribution function\nof the cusp, and make a detailed model for the time-dependent ejection of stars\nduring the IMBH inspiral. We find that (1) the stars are ejected in a burst\nlasting a few dynamical friction timescales; if the ejected stars are detected\nby Gaia they are likely to be produced by a single inspiral event, (2) if the\ninspiral is circular than in the beginning of the burst the velocity vectors of\nthe ejected stars cluster around the inspiral plane, but rapidly isotropise as\nthe burst proceeds, (3) if the inspiral is eccentric, then the stars are\nejected in a broad jet roughly perpendicular to the Runge-Lenz vector of the\nIMBH orbit.

In this paper, we systematically analyze the\npossible physical processes that shape the properties of the early X-ray\nafterglow lightcurves, and use the data to constrain various models. We suggest\nthat the steep decay component is consistent with the tail emission of the\nprompt gamma-ray bursts and/or of the X-ray flares. This provides clear\nevidence that the prompt emission and afterglow emission are two distinct\ncomponents, supporting the internal origin of the GRB prompt emission. The\nshallow decay segment observed in a group of GRBs suggests that the forward\nshock keeps being refreshed for some time. This might be caused either by a\nlong-lived central engine, or by a power law distribution of the shell Lorentz\nfactors, or else by the deceleration of a Poynting flux dominated flow. X-ray\nflares suggest that the GRB central engine is still active after the prompt\ngamma-ray emission is over, but with a reduced activity at later times. In some\ncases, the central engine activity even extends days after the burst trigger.\nAnalyses of early X-ray afterglow data reveal that GRBs are indeed highly\nrelativistic events.

In order to address such questions, we build\na model to describe the distribution of galaxy underdensities. Our model is\nbased on the \"excursion set formalism,\" the same technique used to predict the\ndark matter halo mass function.

However, the computation of the optical properties of such\nparticles is still a very difficult problem. We analyze how the increase of\ngrain porosity influences basic features of cosmic dust -- interstellar\nextinction, dust temperature, infrared bands and millimeter opacity. Porous\ngrains can reproduce the flat extinction across the $3 - 8 \\mkm$ wavelength\nrange measured for several lines of sight by {\\it ISO} and {\\it Spitzer}.\n  Porous grains are generally cooler than compact grains. At the same time, the\ntemperature of very porous grains becomes slightly larger in the case of the\nEMT-Mie calculations in comparison with the results found from the\nlayered-sphere model. The layered-sphere model predicts a broadening of\ninfrared bands and a shift of the peak position to larger wavelengths as\nporosity grows. In the case of the EMT-Mie model variations of the feature\nprofile are less significant. It is also shown that the millimeter mass\nabsorption coefficients grow as porosity increases with a faster growth\noccurring for particles with Rayleigh/non-Rayleigh inclusions. As a result, for\nvery porous particles the coefficients given by two models can differ by a\nfactor of about 3.\n  It is found that an increase of porosity leads to an increase of extinction\ncross sections at some wavelengths and a decrease at others depending on the\ngrain model.

Given the low interaction rates and modest\nradiation levels, we suggest that solar system disruption is a rare event in\nthese clusters. \n\n"}

We compare the original\nsimulation to `shuffled' versions where the galaxy populations are randomly\nswapped among halos of similar mass, thus isolating the effects of correlations\nbetween assembly history and environment at fixed mass. Such correlations are\nignored in the halo occupation distribution models often used populate dark\nmatter simulations with galaxies, but they are significant in our more\nrealistic simulation. Assembly bias enhances 2-point correlations by 10% for\ngalaxies with M_bJ-5logh brighter than -17, but suppresses them by a similar\namount for galaxies brighter than -20. When such samples are split by colour,\nassembly bias is 5% stronger for red galaxies and 5% weaker for blue ones.

Shuffling galaxies among halos of fixed formation redshift or\nconcentration in addition to fixed mass produces biases which are not much\nsmaller than when mass alone is fixed.

In this work, we find that, as a function of spectral index n,\nthe one-loop bispectrum follows a pattern analogous to that of the one-loop\npower spectrum, which shows a change in behavior at a critical index n_c =\n-1.4, where non-linear corrections vanish. For the bispectrum, for n less than\nn_c, one-loop corrections increase the configuration dependence of the leading\norder contribution; for n greater than n_c, one-loop corrections tend to cancel\nthe configuration dependence of the tree-level bispectrum, in agreement with\nknown results from n=-1 numerical simulations. A similar situation is shown to\nhold for the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA), where n_c = -1.75.

We demonstrate using hydrodynamic simulations of\ngalaxy formation in a cosmological context that irregular protogalactic clumps\ncan reproduce the observed velocity width distribution and asymmetries of the\nabsorption profiles equally well. The velocity broadening in the simulated\nclumps is due to a mixture of rotation, random motions, infall and merging.

Previous studies of this problem have incorporated gravitational\ndynamics and adiabatic gas dynamics, but radiative cooling, an essential\nelement of the physics of galaxy formation, normally violates the conditions\nnecessary for self-similar evolution. We show that for any specified value of\nthe initial power spectrum index n [where P(k)~k^n], there is a family of\npower-law cooling functions that preserves self-similarity by ensuring that the\ncooling time in an object of the characteristic mass M_* is a fixed fraction\nt_C of the Hubble time. We perform hydrodynamic numerical simulations with an\nEinstein-de Sitter cosmology, a baryon fraction of 5%, Gaussian initial\nconditions, two different power spectrum indices, and four values of t_C for\neach index, ranging from no cooling to strong cooling. We restrict the\nnumerical simulations to two dimensions in order to allow exploration of a wide\nparameter space with adequate dynamic range. In all cases, the simulations are\nremarkably successful at reproducing the analytically predicted scalings of the\nmass function of dissipated objects and the gas temperature distributions and\ncooled gas fractions in collapsed systems.

Because $\\tilde{b}^{(n)}_j$ with\ndifferent $n$ are independent from each other, a systematic analysis of the\n$j$-spectra of $\\tilde{b}^{(n)}_j$ and $b_j^{(n)}$ is necessary.
