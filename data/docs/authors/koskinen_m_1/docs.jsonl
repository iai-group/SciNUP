We develop a general\nscheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal\nfield theory. Quasiparticles at $\\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic\nvertex operators, $P_{\\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron\noperators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical\nto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function\nhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost\nidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rm\nth}$ CF Landau level.

Remarkably, the model possesses an exact solution\nwhen tuned to a special manifold in its parameter space known as the Toulouse\nlimit. We use the Toulouse limit to exactly calculate the adiabatically pumped\nspin current in the Kondo regime.

However, a nonzero spin current can be pumped through the\nsystem in the presence of a finite magnetic field, provided the spin couples\nasymmetrically to the two leads.

In the weak coupling regime the pairing affects\nonly conduction band of electron-doped layer and valence band of hole-doped\nlayer, thus the ground state is similar to ordinary BCS condensate. At strong\ncoupling, an ultrarelativistic character of electron dynamics reveals and the\nbands which are remote from Fermi surfaces (valence band of electron-doped\nlayer and conduction band of hole-doped layer) are also affected by the\npairing. The analysis of instability of unpaired state shows that s-wave\npairing with band-diagonal condensate structure, described by two gaps, is\npreferable.

However,\naccording to the Byers-Yang theorem, observables of an electronic system are\ninvariant under an adiabatic insertion of a quantum of singular flux. We\nresolve this seeming paradox by considering a microscopic model of electronic\ninterferometers made from a quantum Hall liquid at filling factor 1/m. An\napproximate ground state of such interferometers is described by a Laughlin\ntype wave function, and low-energy excitations are incompressible deformations\nof this state. We construct a low-energy effective theory by restricting the\nmicroscopic Hamiltonian of electrons to the space of incompressible\ndeformations and show that the theory of the quantum Hall edge so obtained is a\ngeneralization of a chiral conformal field theory. In our theory, a\nquasi-particle tunneling operator is found to be a single-valued function of\ntunneling point coordinates, and its phase depends on the topology determined\nby the positions of Ohmic contacts. We describe strong coupling of the edge\nstates to Ohmic contacts and the resulting quasi-particle current through the\ninterferometer with the help of a master equation.

This direct\nsecond quantization in Liouville-Fock space strongly simplifies the\nconstruction of operators and superoperators which transform irreducibly under\nthe Anderson-model symmetry transformations. The fermionic field superoperators\nnaturally arise from the univalence (fermion-parity) superselection rule for\nthe total system. Expressed in these field superoperators, the causal structure\nof the perturbation theory for the effective time-evolution\nsuperoperator-kernel becomes explicit. The causal structure also implies the\nexistence of a fermion-parity protected eigenvector of the exact Liouvillian,\nexplaining a recently reported result on adiabatic driving [Phys. Rev.

One of the knobs, the twist angle\nbetween different layers, plays a crucial role in the ultimate electronic\nproperties of a vdW heterostructure and does not have a direct analog in other\nsystems such as MBE-grown semiconductor heterostructures.

So far, the study of the effect of twist angles in vdW\nheterostructures has been mostly concentrated in graphene/hexagonal boron\nnitride (h-BN) twisted structures, which exhibit relatively weak interlayer\ninteraction due to the presence of a large bandgap in h-BN.

To prove this, we examine the generic band topology of two\ndimensional real fermions in systems with space-time inversion $I_{ST}$\nsymmetry. The Euler class is an integer topological invariant classifying real\ntwo band systems.

Thus the conventional Nielsen-Ninomiya\ntheorem fails in systems with a nonzero Euler class. We propose that the\ntopological phase transition between two insulators carrying distinct Euler\nclasses can be described in terms of the pair creation and annihilation of\nvortices accompanied by winding number changes across Dirac strings.

Abstract: The effect of the inclusion of As antisites in the diluted magnetic\nsemiconductor (Ga,Mn)As is studied within density functional theory in the\nlocal spin density approximation.

Although we use integrability, the nature of the\nproblem is such that our results are not generically exact, but must only be\nconsidered as excellent approximations which nonetheless are valid all the way\nthrough crossover regimes.\n  The key to our approach is to identify the excitations that correspond to\nscattering states and then to compute their associated scattering amplitudes.\nWe are able to do so both in and out of equilibrium. In equilibrium and at zero\ntemperature, we reproduce the Friedel sum rule for an arbitrary magnetic field.\nAt finite temperature, we study the linear response conductance at the\nsymmetric point of the Anderson model, and reproduce Costi et al.'s numerical\nrenormalization group computation of this quantity.

We demonstrate that such a\nsetup acts as an entangler, i.e. it creates spin-singlets of two electrons\nwhich are spatially separated, thereby providing a source of electronic\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs. We show that in the presence of a bias voltage,\nwhich is smaller than the energy gap in the SC, a stationary current of\nspin-entangled electrons can flow from the SC to the LL leads due to Andreev\ntunneling events. We discuss two competing transport channels for Cooper pairs\nto tunnel from the SC into the LL leads. On the one hand, the coherent\ntunneling of two electrons into the same LL lead is shown to be suppressed by\nstrong LL correlations compared to single-electron tunneling into a LL. On the\nother hand, the tunneling of two spin-entangled electrons into different leads\nis suppressed by the initial spatial separation of the two electrons coming\nfrom the same Cooper pair.

{"id": "cond-mat/9911286", "contents": "Title: Gapped Phases of Quantum Wires Abstract: We investigate possible nontrivial phases of a two-subband quantum wire. It\nis found that inter- and intra-subband interactions may drive the electron\nsystem of the wire into a gapped state. If the nominal electron densities in\nthe two subbands are sufficiently close to each other, then the leading\ninstability is the inter-subband charge-density wave (CDW). For large density\nimbalance, the interaction in the inter-subband Cooper channel may lead to a\nsuperconducting instability. The total charge-density mode, responsible for the\nconductance of an ideal wire, always remains gapless, which enforces the\ntwo-terminal conductance to be at the universal value of 2e^2/h per occupied\nsubband. On the contrary, the tunneling density of states (DOS) in the bulk of\nthe wire acquires a hard gap, above which the DOS has a non-universal\nsingularity. This singularity is weaker than the square-root divergency\ncharacteristic for non-interacting quasiparticles near a gap edge due to the\n\"dressing\" of massive modes by a gapless total charge density mode. The DOS for\ntunneling into the end of a wire in a CDW-gapped state preserves the power-law\nbehavior due to the frustration the edge introduces into the CDW order. This\nwork is related to the vast literature on coupled 1D systems, and most of all,\non two-leg Hubbard ladders. Whenever possible, we give derivations of the\nimportant results by other authors, adopted for the context of our study. \n\n"}

Q -> 1) count the\nnumbers of self-avoiding loops (resp. percolation clusters) surrounding a given\npoint. This yields many results, for example the distribution of the number of\npercolation clusters which must be crossed to connect a given point to an\ninfinitely distant boundary. These twist operators correspond to (1,2) in the\nKac classification of conformal field theory, so that their higher-point\ncorrelations, which describe linking numbers around multiple points, may be\ncomputed exactly. As an application we compute the exact value \\sqrt 3/2 for\nthe dimensionless conductivity at the spin Hall transition, as well as the\nshape dependence of the mean conductance in an arbitrary simply connected\ngeometry with two extended edge contacts. \n\n"}
