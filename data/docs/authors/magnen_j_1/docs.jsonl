Observations require that standard model\nparticles must be neutral (or have an extremely small charge) under additional\nmassless U(1)s, i.e. the latter have to belong to a so called hidden sector.\nThe exchange of heavy messengers, however, can lead to a kinetic mixing between\nthe hypercharge and the hidden-sector U(1)s, that is testable with near future\nexperiments. This provides a powerful probe of the hidden sectors and, as a\nconsequence, of the string theory realisation itself.

Crucial to any application is a firm\nunderstanding of the mathematical structure of infinite order partial\ndifferential equations.

Next, based on the relation of exotic smooth R^4 with integral levels of\nSU(2) WZW model we show the correspondence between exotic smoothness on\n4-space, transversal to the world volume of NS5 branes, and the number of these\nNS5 branes.

It is then inevitable\nfor the ILIs to encounter the divergences in the UVDP parameter space due to\nthe generic overlapping divergences in the 4-dimensional momentum space. By\ncomputing the so-called $\\alpha\\beta\\gamma$ integrals arising from two loop\nFeynman diagrams, we show how to deal with the divergences in the parameter\nspace with the LORE method.

The model is described by three Heisenberg chains,\nwith exchange constant J, coupled antiferromagnetically with exchange constant\nJ' along the diagonals of the ladder system, with periodic boundary conditions\nin the shorter direction. We determine the full phase diagram of this model as\na function of spatial anisotropy, J'/J, and magnetic field.

Among the dominant\nphases generated by quantum effects are commensurate and incommensurate\ncoplanar quasi-ordered states, which appear in the vicinity of the isotropic\nregion for most fields, and in the high field region for most anisotropies. The\ncoplanar states, while not classical ground states, can be understood\nsemiclassically.

Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement\nfor the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly\ntransparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for\narbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional and \"breakdown of the elemental particle picture\nin strongly correlated electron matter\", are all inessential to the observed\nfailure of the LT. As regards the singularity of the self-energy \\Sigma(\\omega)\non the real \\omega-axis, observed by DPK, we demonstrate that this also is a\ndirect consequence of the non-uniqueness of the GS of the SU(N) model for 0 < n\n< N.

The two-point function is characterised by different power on\nlarge and small scales, and a burst of small amplitude superimposed\noscillations in between.

We provide a procedure to relate a three dimensional\nq-deformed oscillator algebra to the corresponding algebra satisfied by\ncanonical variables describing non-commutative spaces. The representations for\nthe corresponding operators obey algebras whose uncertainty relations lead to\nminimal length, areas and volumes in phase space, which are in principle\nnatural candidates of many different approaches of quantum gravity. We study\nsome explicit models on these types of noncommutative spaces, first by\nutilising the perturbation theory, later in an exact manner. In many cases the\noperators are not Hermitian, therefore we use PT -symmetry and\npseudo-Hermiticity property, wherever applicable, to make them self-consistent.\nApart from building mathematical models, we focus on the physical implications\nof noncommutative theories too. We construct Klauder coherent states for the\nperturbative and nonperturbative noncommutative harmonic oscillator associated\nwith uncertainty relations implying minimal lengths. In both cases, the\nuncertainty relations for the constructed states are shown to be saturated and\nthus imply to the squeezed coherent states. They are also shown to satisfy the\nEhrenfest theorem dictating the classical like nature of the coherent\nwavepacket. The quality of those states are further underpinned by the\nfractional revival structure. More investigations into the comparison are\ncarried out by a qualitative comparison between the dynamics of the classical\nparticle and that of the coherent states based on numerical techniques.

Here we present a\ncomplete proof of the stability under scalar perturbations of tachyonic thick\nbraneworlds with an embedded maximally symmetric 4D space-time, revealing its\nphysical consistency. This family of models contains a recently reported\ntachyonic de Sitter thick braneworld which possesses a series of appealing\nproperties. These features encompass complete regularity, asymptotic flatness\n(instead of being asymptotically dS or AdS) even when it contains a negative\nbulk cosmological constant, a relevant 3-brane with dS metric which naturally\narises from the full set of field equations of the 5D background (it is not\nimposed), qualitatively describing the inflationary epochs of our Universe, and\na graviton spectrum with a single zero mode bound state that accounts for the\n4D graviton localised on the brane and is separated from the continuum of\nKaluza-Klein massive graviton excitations by a mass gap.

Moreover, we find that each\nboundary region faithfully encodes the physics of the entire bulk entanglement\nwedge. Our method is to interpret the average over random tensors as the\npartition function of a classical ferromagnetic Ising model, so that the\nminimal surfaces of Ryu-Takayanagi appear as domain walls. Upon including the\nanalog of a bulk field, we find that our model reproduces the expected\ncorrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula: the minimal surface is displaced and\nthe entropy is augmented by the entanglement of the bulk field. Increasing the\nentanglement of the bulk field ultimately changes the minimal surface\ntopologically in a way similar to creation of a black hole. Extrapolating bulk\ncorrelation functions to the boundary permits the calculation of the scaling\ndimensions of boundary operators, which exhibit a large gap between a small\nnumber of low-dimension operators and the rest. While we are primarily\nmotivated by AdS/CFT duality, our main results define a more general form of\nbulk-boundary correspondence which could be useful for extending holography to\nother spacetimes. \n\n"}

Here the\nchemical potential $\\mu_{5}$ parametrizes the chiral asymmetry and $\\alpha$ is\nthe fine-structure constant. We study the process of chiral charge erasure\nthrough the thermal fluctuations of magnetic helicity and contrast with the\nwell-studied phenomenon of Chern-Simons number diffusion.

ZrTe5\nhas host a long-standing puzzle on its anomalous transport properties; its\nunderlying origin remains elusive. Lately, ZrTe5 has ignited renewed interest\nbecause it is predicted that single-layer ZrTe5 is a two-dimensional\ntopological insulator and there is possibly a topological phase transition in\nbulk ZrTe5.

Here we report high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved\nphotoemission measurements on ZrTe5. The electronic property of ZrTe5 is\ndominated by two branches of nearly-linear-dispersion bands at the Brillouin\nzone center. These two bands are separated by an energy gap that decreases with\ndecreasing temperature but persists down to the lowest temperature we measured\n(~2 K).

However,\nphysics which emerges in the low-energy corner does not depend on the\ncomplicated details of the system and is relatively simple. It is determined by\nthe nodes in the fermionic spectrum, which are protected by topology in\nmomentum space (in some cases, in combination with the vacuum symmetry). Close\nto the nodes the behavior of the system becomes universal; and the universality\nclasses are determined by the toplogical invariants in momentum space. When one\nchanges the parameters of the system, the transitions are expected to occur\nbetween the vacua with the same symmetry but which belong to different\nuniversality classes. Different types of quantum phase transitions governed by\ntopology in momentum space are discussed in this Chapter. They involve Fermi\nsurfaces, Fermi points, Fermi lines, and also the topological transitions\nbetween the fully gapped states. The consideration based on the momentum space\ntopology of the Green's function is general and is applicable to the vacua of\nrelativistic quantum fields. This is illustrated by the possible quantum phase\ntransition governed by topology of nodes in the spectrum of elementary\nparticles of Standard Model. \n\n"}

Quantum field\ntheories on non-commutative spaces is a first step towards the quantification\nof such a model.
