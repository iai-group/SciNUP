Furthermore, the spin-spin correlation function is a\nconstant at long distances, and it does not show an exponential decay in\ncontrast to short-range models.

In this\ntheory the zeroth-order Hamiltonian describes the vibrational motion in a\nsingle random valley harmonically extended to infinity. This Hamiltonian is\ntractable, is evaluated a priori for monatomic liquids, and the same\nHamiltonian (the same set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors) is used for\nequilibrium and nonequlibrium theory. Here, for the self intermediate\nscattering function Fself(q,t) we find the vibrational contribution is in near\nperfect agreement with molecular dynamics (MD) through short and intermediate\ntimes, at all q. This is direct confirmation that normal mode vibrational\ncorrelations are present in the motion of the liquid state. The primary transit\neffect is diffusive motion of the vibrational equilibrium positions, as the\nliquid transits rapidly among random valleys. This motion is modeled as a\nstandard random walk, and the resulting theoretical Fself(q,t) is in excellent\nagreement with MD results at all q and t. In the limit for q to infinity, the\ntheory automatically exhibits the correct approach to the free-particle limit.\nAlso in the limit for q to zero, the hydrodynamic limit emerges as well. In\ncontrast to the benchmark theories of generalized hydrodynamics and mode\ncoupling, the present theory is near a priori, while achieving modestly better\naccuracy.

Unlike the AFM order in cuprates, the\nnature of the magnetism and of the underlying electronic state in the iron\npnictide superconductors is not well understood. Neither density functional\ntheory nor models based on atomic physics and superexchange, account for the\nsmall size of the magnetic moment. Many low energy probes such as transport,\nSTM and ARPES measured strong anisotropy of the electronic states akin to the\nnematic order in a liquid crystal, but there is no consensus on its physical\norigin, and a three dimensional picture of electronic states and its relations\nto the optical conductivity in the magnetic state is lacking.

At low\ntemperatures we observe a clear asymmetry in the emission intensity depending\non whether the exciton is at higher or lower energy than the cavity mode.

Using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we track in particular the dynamic charge structure factor and the\nsingle-particle spectrum across the transition. With increasing electron-phonon\ncoupling, the dynamic charge structure factor reveals the emergence of a charge\ngap, and a clear signature of phonon softening at the zone boundary. The\nsingle-particle spectral function evolves continuously across the transition.\nHybridization of the charge and phonon modes of the Luttinger liquid\ndescription leads to two modes, one of which corresponds to the coherent\npolaron band.

The\nnegative permeability slab serves to focus the flux generated in the source\ncoil to the receiver coil, thereby increasing the mutual inductive coupling\nbetween the coils. The numerical model is compared with an analytical theory\nthat treats the coils as point dipoles separated by an infinite planar layer of\nmagnetic material [Urzhumov et al., Phys. Rev. B, 19, 8312 (2011)]. In the\nlimit of vanishingly small radius of the coils, and large width of the\nmetamaterial slab, the numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with\nthe analytical model. Both the idealized analytical and realistic numerical\nmodels predict similar trends with respect to metamaterial loss and anisotropy.\nApplying the numerical models, we further analyze the impact of finite coil\nsize and finite width of the slab. We find that, even for these less idealized\ngeometries, the presence of the magnetic slab greatly enhances the coupling\nbetween the two coils, including cases where significant loss is present in the\nslab.

Our main results\nare uniform versions of the DeGeorge--Wallach Theorem, of a theorem of Delorme\nand various other limit multiplicity theorems.\n  A basic idea is to adapt the notion of Benjamini--Schramm convergence\n(BS-convergence), originally introduced for sequences of finite graphs of\nbounded degree, to sequences of Riemannian manifolds, and analyze the possible\nlimits. We show that BS-convergence of locally symmetric spaces implies\nconvergence, in an appropriate sense, of the associated normalized relative\nPlancherel measures. This then yields convergence of normalized multiplicities\nof unitary representations, Betti numbers and other spectral invariants. On the\nother hand, when the corresponding Lie group $G$ is simple and of real rank at\nleast two, we prove that there is only one possible BS-limit, i.e. when the\nvolume tends to infinity, locally symmetric spaces always BS-converge to their\nuniversal cover $G/K$. This leads to various general uniform results.\n  When restricting to arbitrary sequences of congruence covers of a fixed\narithmetic manifold we prove a strong quantitative version of BS-convergence\nwhich in turn implies upper estimates on the rate of convergence of normalized\nBetti numbers in the spirit of Sarnak--Xue.\n  An important role in our approach is played by the notion of Invariant Random\nSubgroups.

These features should be detectable in the inelastic electron\ntunneling spectroscopy, $d^2I/dV^2$, using local probing techniques. Inelastic\nFriedel oscillations distort the spectral density at energies close to the\ninelastic mode.

In the\npresence of the trapping harmonic-oscillator (HO) potential, we report the\nexistence of even, odd, and asymmetric spatial modes. They feature alternating\ndomains with opposite directions of the pseudo-spin, i.e., anti-ferromagnetic\nstructures, which is explained by the interplay of the linear couplings, HO\nconfinement, and repulsive self-interaction. The number of the domains is\ndetermined by the strength of the SO coupling. The modes are constructed\nanalytically in the weakly nonlinear system. The dynamical stability of the\nmodes is investigated by means of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and direct\nsimulations. A notable result is that the multi-domain-wall (DW) structures are\nstable, alternating between odd and even shapes, while the simplest single-DW\nstructure is unstable. Thus, the system features a transition to the complex\nground states under the action of the SO coupling. The addition of the Zeeman\nsplitting transforms the odd modes into asymmetric ones via spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking. The results suggest possibilities for switching the binary\nsystem between states with opposite (pseudo) magnetization by external fields,\nand realization of similar stable states and dynamical effects in solid-state\nand nonlinear-optical settings emulated by the SO-coupled BECs. \n\n"}

This orbital\ntexture switch is determined by the existence of three main properties: local\nor global inversion symmetry breaking, strong spin-orbit coupling, and\nnon-local physics (the electrons are on a lattice). Using our model we\ndemonstrate that the orbital texture switch is ubiquitous and to be expected in\nmany real systems.

The proton NMR spectrum from a dry sample of\npolycrystalline silicon powder (1-5 $\\mu$m) shows a distinctively narrow\nLorentzian-shaped resonance with a width of 6.2 kHz, indicative of a very\nsparse distribution of protons attached to the silicon surface. These protons\nare within a few atomic monolayers of the silicon surface. The high sensitivity\nNMR detection of surface protons from low surface area ($0.26 - 1.3 \\: m^2/g$)\nparticles is enabled by an overall signal enhancement of 4150 over the room\ntemperature NMR signal at the same field. When the particles were suspended in\na solvent with 80% H2O and 20% D2O, the narrow peak was observed to grow in\nintensity over time, indicating growth of the sparse surface proton layer.\nHowever, when the particles were suspended in a solvent with 20% H2O and 80%\nD2O, the narrow bound-proton peak was observed to shrink due to exchange\nbetween the surface protons and the deuterium in solution. This decrease was\naccompanied by a concomitant growth in the intensity of the frozen solvent\npeak, as the relative proton concentration of the solvent increased. When the\nparticles were suspended in the organic solvent hexane, the proton NMR spectra\nremained unchanged over time. These results are consistent with the known\nchemisorption of water on the silicon surface resulting in the formation of\nhydride and hydroxyl species. Low-temperature DNP NMR can thus be used as a\nnon-destructive probe of surface corrosion for silicon in aqueous environments.\nThis is important in the context of using silicon MEMS and bioMEMS devices in\nsuch environments, for silicon micro- and nano-particle MRI imaging agents, and\nthe use of nanosilicon for splitting water in fuel cells. \n\n"}

Our\nselected prototype, the category Bmod of modules over the Boolean semifield B\nis the replacement for the category of abelian groups. We show that the\nsemi-additive category Bmod fulfills analogues of the axioms AB1 and AB2 for\nabelian categories. By introducing a precise comonad on Bmod we obtain the\nconceptually related Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore categories. The latter\ncategory Bmod^s is simply Bmod in the topos of sets endowed with an involution\nand as such it shares with Bmod most of its abstract categorical properties.\nThe three main results of the paper are the following. First, when endowed with\nthe natural ideal of null morphisms, the category Bmod^s is a semi-exact,\nhomological category in the sense of M. Grandis.

Noticeably, the TNPs reside around Fermi energy with large linear\nenergy range along tilt direction (> 1 eV) and the NRs are formed by three\nstrongly entangled bands. Under symmetry-preserving strain, each NR would\nevolve into four droplet-shaped NRs before fading away, producing distinct\nevolution compared with that in usual two-band NR. When SOC is included, TNPs\nwould transform into type-II Dirac points while all the NRs have gaped.\nRemarkably, the type-II Dirac points inherit the advantages of TNPs: residing\naround Fermi energy and exhibiting large linear energy range. Both features\nfacilitate the observation of interesting phenomena induced by type-II\ndispersion.

The Monte Carlo study is based on a lattice model, the restricted\nsolid-on-solid model with point-contact type step--step attraction (p-RSOS\nmodel). The temperature is selected to be in the step-faceting zone where the\nsurface is surrounded by the (001) terrace and the (111) faceted step at\nequilibrium.

For example, when Mg is\npartially substituted by Cu or Zn, the displacement of Cu or Zn is much larger\nthan that of Mg, and is even comparable to that of Nb. The polarization of\nthese systems is also increased, especially for the Cu-doped solution, due to\nthe large polarizability of Cu and Zn.

RAVE involves iterations between molecular simulations and deep\nlearning in order to produce an increasingly accurate probability distribution\nalong a low-dimensional latent space that captures the key features of the\nmolecular simulation trajectory. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between\nthis latent space distribution and the distribution of various trial reaction\ncoordinates sampled from the molecular simulation, RAVE determines an optimum,\nyet nonetheless physically interpretable, reaction coordinate and optimum\nprobability distribution.

A variety of many-body\nsystems can be represented in momentum space as a spin-1/2 state evolving on\nthe Bloch sphere, where each momentum mode is decoupled and thus can be\nsimulated independently by a single qubit. Here, we report the observation of a\ndynamical quantum phase transition in a superconducting qubit simulation of the\nquantum quench dynamics of many-body systems.

In our experiment, the spin\nstate, which is initially polarized longitudinally, evolves based on a\nHamiltonian with adjustable parameters depending on the momentum and strength\nof the transverse magnetic field.

In the\nthermodynamic limit, the system can exist in one of the following phases -- (a)\nPinned Aggregate (PA) phase in which an infinite aggregate (with mass\nproportional to the volume of the system) appears with probability one at the\nchipping site but not in the bulk.

A nonlinear response theory is developed for\nnonlocal spin-dependent perturbing potentials. The ionic pseudopotential of the\nheterostructure is treated as a perturbation of a bulk reference crystal, and\nthe self-energy is derived to second order in the perturbation. If spin-orbit\ncoupling is neglected outside the atomic cores, the problem can be analyzed as\nif the perturbation were a local spin scalar, since the nonlocal spin-dependent\npart of the pseudopotential merely renormalizes the results obtained from a\nlocal perturbation.

The impurity contribution to the uniform part of the entanglement\nentropy, S_{imp}, is defined and analyzed in detail in both the gapless, J_2 <=\nJ_2^c, as well as the dimerized phase, J_2>J_2^c, of the model. This quantum\nimpurity model is in the universality class of the single channel Kondo model\nand it is shown that in a quite universal way the presence of the impurity in\nthe gapless phase, J_2 <= J_2^c, gives rise to a large length scale, xi_K,\nassociated with the screening of the impurity, the size of the Kondo screening\ncloud.

The variance of the\ndisplacement of the tagged particle, averaged with respect to an initial\nstationary ensemble and stochastic evolution, grows linearly with time at both\nsmall and very large times. We find that at intermediate times, it shows\noscillations with a well defined size-dependent period.

Our first goal in this paper is expository: we explain both\napproaches and a proof of their equivalence. Our second goal is to generalize\nthis result to enriched categories and homotopy weighted limits, showing that\nthe classical explicit constructions still give the right answer in the\nabstract sense. This result partially bridges the gap between classical\nhomotopy theory and modern abstract homotopy theory. To do this we introduce a\nnotion of \"enriched homotopical categories\", which are more general than\nenriched model categories, but are still a good place to do enriched homotopy\ntheory.
