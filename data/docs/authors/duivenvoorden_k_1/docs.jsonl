This enables to derive the renormalized\nquantities in a manifestly cutoff independent way and to present them in the\nform of strongly convergent integrals. However, applications of the Abel-Plana\nformula, in its usual form, are restricted by simple geometries when the\neigenmodes have a simple dependence on quantum numbers. The author generalized\nthe Abel-Plana formula which essentially enlarges its application range. Based\non this generalization, formulae have been obtained for various types of series\nover the zeros of combinations of Bessel functions and for integrals involving\nthese functions. It has been shown that these results generalize the special\ncases existing in literature. Further, the derived summation formulae have been\nused to summarize series arising in the direct mode summation approach to the\nCasimir effect for spherically and cylindrically symmetric boundaries, for\nboundaries moving with uniform proper acceleration, and in various braneworld\nscenarios.

It is seen that these clauses are elements\nof a Hilbert space, such that addition is logical disjunction, the dual space\nconsists of consequent clauses, and the inner product is a set of statements in\nthe subjunctive mood. The probability interpretation gives truth values for\ncorresponding future tense statements when the initial state is actually\nprepared and the final state is to be measured. The mathematical structure of\nquantum mechanics is formulated in terms of discrete measurement results at\nfinite level of accuracy and does not depend on an assumption of a substantive,\nor background, space-time continuum. A continuum of kets, |x> for x in R^3, is\nconstructed from linear combinations of kets in a finite basis. The inner\nproduct can be expressed either as a finite sum or as an integral. Discrete\nposition functions are uniquely embedded into smooth wave functions in such a\nway that differential operators are defined. It is shown that the choice of\nbasis has no effect on underlying physics (quantum covariance). The Dirac delta\nhas a representation as a smooth function. Operators do not in general have an\nintegral form. The Schroedinger equation is shown from the requirements of the\nprobability interpretation. It is remarked that a formal construction of qed\navoiding divergence problems has been completed using finite dimensional\nHilbert space. I conclude that quantum mechanics makes statements about the\nworld with clear physical meaning, such that space is emergent from particle\ninteractions and has no fundamental role. \n\n"}

Slowly, a new picture of\ncomputation arose, one that gave rise to a variety of faster algorithms, novel\ncryptographic mechanisms, and alternative methods of communication. Small\nquantum information processing devices have been built, and efforts are\nunderway to build larger ones.

The key assumption is that each system A can be paired with an\nisomorphic $\\textit{conjugate}$ system, $\\overline{A}$, by means of a\nnon-signaling bipartite state $\\eta_A$ perfectly and uniformly correlating each\nbasic measurement on A with its counterpart on $\\overline{A}$. In the case of a\nquantum-mechanical system associated with a complex Hilbert space $\\mathcal H$,\nthe conjugate system is that associated with the conjugate Hilbert space\n$\\overline{\\mathcal H}$, and $\\eta_A$ corresponds to the standard maximally\nentangled EPR state on ${\\mathcal H} \\otimes \\overline{\\mathcal H}$.

The magnetic interaction between two\nelectrons can therefore impose a change in their spin orientation. This\nprocess, however, was never observed in experiment. The challenge is two-fold.\nAt the atomic scale, where the coupling is relatively large, the magnetic\ninteraction is often overshadowed by the much larger coulomb exchange\ncounterpart. In typical situations where exchange is negligible, magnetic\ninteractions are also very weak and well below ambient magnetic noise. Here we\nreport on the first measurement of the magnetic interaction between two\nelectronic spins. To this end, we used the ground state valence electrons of\ntwo $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions, co-trapped in an electric Paul trap and separated by\nmore than two micrometers. We measured the weak, millihertz scale\n(alternatively $10^{-18}$ eV or $10^{-14}$ K), magnetic interaction between\ntheir electronic spins. This, in the presence of magnetic noise that was six\norders of magnitude larger than the respective magnetic fields the electrons\napply on each other. Cooperative spin dynamics was kept coherent for 15 s\nduring which spin-entanglement was generated. The sensitivity necessary for\nthis measurement was provided by restricting the spin evolution to a\nDecoherence-Free Subspace (DFS) which is immune to collective magnetic field\nnoise.

The reported\nmethod suggests an alternative route to the search of long-range anomalous\nspin-spin forces and can be generalized to include Quantum Error Correction\ncodes for other cases of extremely weak signal detection. \n\n"}

Amongst many ways to achieve this, single-photon probes\ncan be used in a method called quantum process tomography (QPT). Furthermore,\nQPT is an essential method in determining how a process acts on quantum\nmechanical states. For example for quantum technology, QPT is used to\ncharacterise multi-qubit processors and quantum communication channels; across\nquantum physics QPT of some form is often the first experimental investigation\nof a new physical process, as shown in the recent research into coherent\ntransport in biological mechanisms. However, the precision of QPT is limited by\nthe fact that measurements with single-particle probes are subject to\nunavoidable shot noise---this holds for both single photon and laser probes.

Our findings reveal that a number of proposals for verb\nconstruction lead to almost separable tensors, a fact that considerably\nsimplifies the interactions between the words. We examine the ramifications of\nthis fact, and we show that the use of Frobenius algebras mitigates the\npotential problems to a great extent.

There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently\nwell understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired\nquantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in\nquantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to\ndescribe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems\ngenerally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a\nmicroscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and\nmolecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of\nmany-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding\nof open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body\ncontext.

The entanglement\ncontour provides a complementary, more refined approach to characterizing\nentanglement than just considering the entanglement entropy between A and B,\nwith several concrete advantages.

Although an implementation in a material was considered unlikely, it has\nprovided the conceptual basis for theoretical and experimental research\nexploring topological insulators and superconductors. Here we report on the\nexperimental realisation of the Haldane model and the characterisation of its\ntopological band-structure, using ultracold fermionic atoms in a periodically\nmodulated optical honeycomb lattice. The model is based on breaking\ntime-reversal symmetry as well as inversion symmetry. The former is achieved\nthrough the introduction of complex next-nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms,\nwhich we induce through circular modulation of the lattice position. For the\nlatter, we create an energy offset between neighbouring sites. Breaking either\nof these symmetries opens a gap in the band-structure, which is probed using\nmomentum-resolved interband transitions. We explore the resulting\nBerry-curvatures of the lowest band by applying a constant force to the atoms\nand find orthogonal drifts analogous to a Hall current. The competition between\nboth broken symmetries gives rise to a transition between topologically\ndistinct regimes. By identifying the vanishing gap at a single Dirac point, we\nmap out this transition line experimentally and quantitatively compare it to\ncalculations using Floquet theory without free parameters. We verify that our\napproach, which allows for dynamically tuning topological properties, is\nsuitable even for interacting fermionic systems.

In this paper, we present a\nsystematic study of those matrix product operators, and show how this relates\nentanglement properties of projected entangled-pair states to the formalism of\nfusion tensor categories.

We do this by first\nconstructing a holographic $c$-function using causal horizon in the black brane\ngeometry. The UV value of the $c$-function is $a_{UV}$ and then it decreases\nmonotonically to zero at the curvature singularity. Intuitively, the behavior\nof the $c$-function can be understood if we recognize that the dual CFT is in a\nthermal state and thermal states are effectively massive with a gap set by the\ntemperature. In field theory, logarithmic entanglement negativity is an\nentanglement measure for mixed states. For example, in two dimensional CFTs on\ninfinite line at finite temperature, the renormalized entanglement negativity\nof an interval has UV (Low- T) value $c_{UV}$ and IR (High-T) value zero. So\nthis is a potential candidate for our $c$-function. In four dimensions we\nexpect the same thing to hold on physical grounds. Now since the causal horizon\ngoes behind the black brane horizon the holographic $c$-function is sensitive\nto the physics of the interior. Correspondingly the field theory $c$-function\nshould also contain information about the interior. So our results suggest that\nhigh temperature (IR) expansion of the negativity (or any candidate\n$c$-function) may be a way to probe part of the physics near the singularity.\nNegativity at finite temperature depends on the full operator content of the\ntheory and so perhaps this can be be done in specific cases only.\n  The existence of this $c$-function in the bulk is an extreme example of the\nparadigm that space-time is built out of entanglement. In particular the fact\nthat the $c$-function reaches zero at the curvature singularity correlates the\ntwo facts : loss of quantum entanglement in the IR field theory and the end of\ngeometry in the bulk which in this case is the formation of curvature\nsingularity. \n\n"}

This review\ndiscusses several fundamental aspects of the GGE and generalized thermalization\nin integrable systems. In particular, we focus on questions such as: which\nobservables equilibrate to the GGE predictions and who should play the role of\nthe bath; what conserved quantities can be used to construct the GGE; what are\nthe differences between generalized thermalization in noninteracting systems\nand in interacting systems mappable to noninteracting ones; why is it that the\nGGE works when traditional ensembles of statistical mechanics fail. Despite a\nlot of interest in these questions in recent years, no definite answers have\nbeen given. We review results for the XX model and for the transverse field\nIsing model. For the latter model, we also report original results and show\nthat the GGE describes spin-spin correlations over the entire system.

The existence of these two different forms of correlation in quantum\nmany-body systems suggests the possibility of formulating an approximation\nwhich affects quantum correlations only, without preventing the correct\ndescription of classical fluctuations at all length scales. Focusing on lattice\nboson and quantum Ising models, we make use of the path-integral formulation of\nquantum statistical mechanics to introduce such an approximation -- that we dub\n\\emph{quantum mean-field} (QMF) approach, and which can be readily generalized\nto a cluster form (cluster QMF or cQMF). The cQMF approximation reduces to\ncluster mean-field theory at $T=0$, while at any finite temperature it produces\na family of systematically improved, semi-classical approximations to the\nquantum statistical mechanics of the lattice theory at hand. Contrary to\nstandard MF approximations, the correct nature of thermal critical phenomena is\ncaptured by any cluster size. In the two exemplary cases of the two-dimensional\nquantum Ising model and of two-dimensional quantum rotors, we study\nsystematically the convergence of the cQMF approximation towards the exact\nresult, and show that the convergence is typically linear or sub-linear in the\n{ boundary-to-bulk ratio} of the clusters as $T\\to 0$, while it becomes faster\nthan linear as $T$ grows. These results pave the way towards the development of\nsemi-classical numerical approaches based on an approximate, { yet}\nsystematically improved account of quantum correlations. \n\n"}

To this aim, we suggest a parallel\nalgorithm based on the Taylor series expansion of the evolution operator, and\ncompare its performances with those of algorithms based on the exact\ndiagonalization of the Hamiltonian or a 4-th order Runge-Kutta integration. We\nprove that both Taylor-series expansion and Runge-Kutta algorithms are reliable\nand have a low computational cost, the Taylor-series expansion showing the\nadditional advantage of a memory allocation not depending on the precision of\ncalculation.

In this work, we present a quantum\nannealing approach to measure similarity among molecular structures.\nImplementing real-world problems on a quantum annealer is challenging due to\nhardware limitations such as sparse connectivity, intrinsic control error, and\nlimited precision. In order to overcome the limited connectivity, a problem\nmust be reformulated using minor-embedding techniques.

Given an initial state, a target state, and a Hamiltonian with\na set of permissible controls, can we reach the target state with coherent\nquantum evolution and, in that case, what is the minimum time required?

We prove\nthat the data-processing bound can be at most 1.45 bits larger than a known\nlower bound on these capacities of the phase-insensitive Gaussian channel. We\ndiscuss another data-processing upper bound as well. Two other upper bounds,\nwhich we call the \"$\\varepsilon$-degradable bound\" and the\n\"$\\varepsilon$-close-degradable bound,\" are established using the notion of\napproximate degradability along with energy constraints. We find a strong\nlimitation on any potential superadditivity of the coherent information of any\nphase-insensitive Gaussian channel in the low-noise regime, as the\ndata-processing bound is very near to a known lower bound in such cases.

The\nlaws of quantum mechanics dictate that the wave function evolves unitarily, but\nthis unitary evolution is only manifest when considering the global description\nof the wave function; it is not implemented by time evolution on a single\nsemiclassical branch.

The purpose\nof this work is to expound the impact on the creation of entanglement coming\nfrom the combined action of the different physical processes underlying the\nHawking effect and the Unruh-Starobinskii effect.

In this Paper, we\nfabricate and characterize coplanar waveguide resonators made from aluminum\nthin films deposited on silicon substrates.

Here,\nwe develop the Keldysh non-linear sigma model technique to calculate these\ncorrelators in interacting disordered metals. In particular, we focus on the\nregularized and unregularized OTOCs, defined as $Tr[\\sqrt{\\rho} A(t)\n\\sqrt{\\rho} A^\\dagger(t)]$ and $Tr[\\rho A(t)A^\\dagger(t)]$ respectively (where\n$A(t)$ is the anti-commutator of fermion field operators and $\\rho$ is the\nthermal density matrix). The calculation of the rate of OTOCs' exponential\ngrowth is reminiscent to that of the dephasing rate in interacting metals, but\nhere it involves two replicas of the system (two \"worlds\"). The intra-world\ncontributions reproduce the dephasing (that would correspond to a decay of the\ncorrelator), while the inter-world terms provide a term of the opposite sign\nthat exceeds dephasing. Consequently, both regularized and unregularized OTOCs\ngrow exponentially in time, but surprisingly we find that the corresponding\nmany-body Lyapunov exponents are different. For the regularized correlator, we\nreproduce an earlier perturbation theory result for the Lyapunov exponent that\nsatisfies the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound. However, the Lyapunov exponent\nof the unregularized correlator parametrically exceeds the bound. We argue that\nthe latter is not a reliable indicator of many body quantum chaos as it\ncontains additional contributions from elastic scattering events due to virtual\nprocesses that should not contribute to many-body chaos. These results bring up\nan important general question of the physical meaning of the OTOCs often used\nin calculations and proofs.

We\nbegin by constructing a toy model of Bell pair dynamics which demonstrates that\nmeasurements can keep a system in a state of low (i.e. area law) entanglement,\nin contrast with the volume law entanglement produced by generic pure unitary\ntime evolution. While the simplest Bell pair model has area law entanglement\nfor any measurement rate, as seen in certain non-interacting systems, we show\nthat more generic models of entanglement can feature an area-to-volume law\ntransition at a critical value of the measurement rate, in agreement with\nrecent numerical investigations.

Here, we exploit a fruitful interplay of\nideas from both fields to begin developing a unifying approach to\ntransformations among quantum reference systems that ultimately aims at\nencompassing both quantum and gravitational physics. In particular, using a\ngravity inspired symmetry principle, which enforces physical observables to be\nrelational and leads to an inherent redundancy in the description, we develop a\nperspective-neutral structure, which contains all frame perspectives at once\nand via which they are changed. We show that taking the perspective of a\nspecific frame amounts to a fixing of the symmetry related redundancies in both\nthe classical and quantum theory and that changing perspective corresponds to a\nsymmetry transformation.

For a\ntwo-setting, two-outcome Bell test, we derive modified Bell inequalities that\nrelax measurement independence, for either or both observers, while remaining\nlocally causal. We describe the loss of measurement independence for each\nobserver using the parameters $M_1$ and $M_2$, as defined by Hall in 2010, and\nalso by a more complete description that adds two new parameters, which we call\n$\\hat{M}_1$ and $\\hat{M}_2$, deriving a modified Bell inequality for each\ndescription. These \"relaxed\" inequalities subsume those considered in previous\nwork as special cases, and quantify how much the assumption of measurement\nindependence needs to be relaxed in order for a locally causal model to produce\na given violation of the standard Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH)\ninequality.

In order to investigate whether the `measurement'\ntakes place in the amplification chain, in which a parametric amplifier is\noften chosen as the first amplifier, it is proposed to construct a microwave\ninterferometer that has such an amplifier added to each of its arms. Feeding\nthe interferometer with single photons, the interference visibility depends on\nthe gain of the amplifiers and whether a measurement collapse has taken place\nduring the amplification process. The visibility as given by standard quantum\nmechanics is calculated as a function of gain, insertion loss and temperature.\nWe find a visibility of 1/3 in the limit of large gain without taking into\naccount losses, which is reduced to 0.26 in case the insertion loss of the\namplifiers is 2.2 dB at a temperature of 50 mK.

Success in state targeting can be described as having\nsome control over the outcome of the test. We show that increasing one's\ncontrol above a minimum amount implies an unavoidable increase in the\nprobability of failing the test. This is analogous to the unavoidable\ndisturbance to a quantum state that results from gaining information about its\nidentity, and can be shown to be a purely quantum effect.

Formal Languages for\n  Physics Abstract: This paper is the first in a series whose goal is to develop a fundamentally\nnew way of constructing theories of physics. The motivation comes from a desire\nto address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories\nof space and time. Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of\nphysics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain\nformal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics arises when\nthe topos is the category of sets. Other types of theory employ a different\ntopos. In this paper we discuss two different types of language that can be\nattached to a system, S. The first is a propositional language, PL(S); the\nsecond is a higher-order, typed language L(S). Both languages provide deductive\nsystems with an intuitionistic logic. The reason for introducing PL(S) is that,\nas shown in paper II of the series, it is the easiest way of understanding, and\nexpanding on, the earlier work on topos theory and quantum physics. However,\nthe main thrust of our programme utilises the more powerful language L(S) and\nits representation in an appropriate topos. \n\n"}

The present paper further develops this quantum-vacuum approach to\nsonoluminescence: We calculate Bogolubov coefficients relating the QED vacuum\nstates in the presence of a homogeneous medium of changing dielectric constant.\nIn this way we derive an estimate for the spectrum, number of photons, and\ntotal energy emitted.
