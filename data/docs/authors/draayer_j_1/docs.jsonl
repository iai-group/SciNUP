The evolution operator is uniquely determined by the\ntime-dependent dual generators that satisfy a system of differential equations,\ndubbed here dual Schrodinger-Bloch equations, which represent a viable\nalternative to the conventional Schrodinger formulation.

We prove that the symmetric, nonlinear ground states must\nundergo a symmetry breaking bifurcation if the potential has a non-degenerate\nlocal maxima at zero. Under a generic assumption we show that the bifurcation\nis either subcritical or supercritical pitchfork. In the particular case of\ndouble-well potentials with large separation, the power of nonlinearity\ndetermines the subcritical or supercritical character of the bifurcation. The\nresults are obtained from a careful analysis of the spectral properties of the\nground states at both small and large values for the corresponding eigenvalue\nparameter. We employ a novel technique combining concentration--compactness and\nspectral properties of linearized Schr\\\"odinger type operators to show that the\nsymmetric ground states can either be uniquely continued for the entire\ninterval of the eigenvalue parameter or they undergo a symmetry--breaking\npitchfork bifurcation due to the second eigenvalue of the linearized operator\ncrossing zero.

The description of chiral symmetry\nbreaking and translational symmetry breaking can become intertwined. Here, the\nfocus is on aspects of chiral symmetry breaking and its possible restoration\nthat are by construction independent of the nature of translational symmetry\nbreaking---namely spatial averages of chiral order parameters. A system will be\nconsidered to be chirally restored provided all spatially-averaged chiral order\nparameters are zero. A critical question is whether chiral restoration in this\nsense is possible for phases in which chiral order parameters are locally\nnon-zero but whose spatial averages all vanish. We show that this is not\npossible unless all chirally-invariant observables are spatially uniform. This\nresult is first derived for Skyrme-type models, which are based on a nonlinear\nsigma model and by construction break chiral symmetry on a point-by-point\nbasis.

To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the\npropagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we\nadopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the $(1+1)$\nquasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of\nthe coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of\n\"mesons\" with a finite mass and the screening of \"quark\" charge that are\ncrucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons.

{"id": "1208.3722", "contents": "Title: Too massive neutron stars: The role of dark matter? Abstract: The maximum mass of a neutron star is generally determined by the equation of\nstate of the star material. In this study, we take into account dark matter\nparticles, assumed to behave like fermions with a free parameter to account for\nthe interaction strength among the particles, as a possible constituent of\nneutron stars. We find dark matter inside the star would soften the equation of\nstate more strongly than that of hyperons, and reduce largely the maximum mass\nof the star. However, the neutron star maximum mass is sensitive to the\nparticle mass of dark matter, and a very high neutron star mass larger than 2\ntimes solar mass could be achieved when the particle mass is small enough. Such\nkind of dark-matter- admixed neutron stars could explain the recent measurement\nof the Shapiro delay in the radio pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which yielded a\nneutron star mass of 2 times solar mass that may be hardly reached when\nhyperons are considered only, as in the case of the microscopic Brueckner\ntheory. Furthermore, in this particular case, we point out that the dark matter\naround a neutron star should also contribute to the mass measurement due to its\npure gravitational effect. However, our numerically calculation illustrates\nthat such contribution could be safely ignored because of the usual diluted\ndark matter environment assumed. We conclude that a very high mass measurement\nof about 2 times solar mass requires a really stiff equation of state in\nneutron stars, and find a strong upper limit (<= 0.64 GeV) for the particle\nmass of non-self- annihilating dark matter based on the present model. \n\n"}

In\nthe smallest QEC codes, the information in one logical qubit is encoded in a\ntwo-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space of multiple physical qubits.\nFor each code, a set of non-demolition multi-qubit measurements, termed\nstabilizers, can discretize and signal physical qubit errors without collapsing\nthe encoded information. Experimental demonstrations of QEC to date, using\nnuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, photons, superconducting qubits, and\nNV centers in diamond, have circumvented stabilizers at the cost of decoding at\nthe end of a QEC cycle. This decoding leaves the quantum information vulnerable\nto physical qubit errors until re-encoding, violating a basic requirement for\nfault tolerance.

At tree-level, the emission of a soft gauge\nboson at subleading order in its energy is given by the Low-Burnett-Kroll\ntheorem, with the angular momentum operator acting on a lower-point amplitude.\nFor well separated particles at tree-level, we prove the Low-Burnett-Kroll\ntheorem using matrix elements of subleading SCET Lagrangian and operator\ninsertions which are individually gauge invariant.

But rather high interior temperatures (~10^5 K) and a stratified D\nlayer are needed, making such a scenario unlikely. In this paper, we re-examine\nDD fusion, with the addition of screening effects pertinent to a deuterated\ncore containing ice and some heavy elements. This alleviates the extreme\ntemperature constraint and removes the requirement of a stratified D layer. As\nan application, we propose that, if their core temperatures are a few times\n10^4 K and core composition is chemically inhomogeneous, the observed inflated\nsize of some giant exoplanets (\"hot Jupiters\") may be linked to screened DD\nfusion occurring deep in the interior. Application of an analytic evolution\nmodel suggests that the amount of inflation from this effect can be important\nif there is sufficient rock-ice in the core, making DD fusion an effective\nextra internal energy source for radius inflation. The mechanism of screened DD\nfusion, operating in the above temperature range, is generally consistent with\nthe trend in radius anomaly with planetary equilibrium temperature $T_{\\rm\neq}$, and also depends on planetary mass.

We use overlap fermions, which have exact chiral symmetry\non the lattice, to probe the anomalous U(1) symmetry violation of 2+1 flavor\ndynamical QCD configurations with domain wall fermions. The latter also\noptimally preserves chiral and flavor symmetries on the lattice, since it is\nknown that the remnant chiral symmetry of the light quarks influences the\nscaling of the chiral condensate in the crossover transition region.

Here we introduce\na hybridized magnetometery platform, consisting of a sensor and ancilla, that\nallows sensing static magnetic fields with interrogation times up to the much\nlonger T2 coherence time, allowing significant potential gains in field\nsensitivity.

Since the application\nof standard pulsed dynamical decoupling sequences leads to strong decoupling\nfrom the environment, while other specialized pulse sequences can decouple\ncoherent dipolar interactions, such sequences can be used to identify the\ndominant interaction type. Moreover, a proper combination of pulsed decoupling\nsequences could lead to the suppression of both interaction types, allowing\nadditional spin manipulations. Finally, we consider the effect of finite-width\npulses on these control protocols and identify improved decoupling efficiency\nwith increased pulse duration, resulting from the interplay of dephasing and\ncoherent dynamics. \n\n"}

The couplings of many\nradially excited heavy vector mesons are measured, while the corresponding\ncouplings for light vector mesons are not known.

The method is suggested by\nour observation that the electromagnetic coupling of the $n$-th radial\nexcitation of $S$-wave heavy vector meson decouples from the $e^+e^-$\nannihilation with nearly exponential rate with $n$. It becomes natural to\nassume that the same effect takes place in the light vector mesons and this\nwould allow to estimate the unknown couplings.

In this work we first elaborate on the meaning of the notion of\nspace-time order in a given configuration which is conceptually at the heart of\nthe path-integral approach to vacuum structure. It is argued that the\nalgorithmic complexity of binary strings associated with coarse-grained\ndescriptions of the configuration provides a relevant quantitative measure.

Abstract: The development of the early Universe is a remarkable laboratory for the\nstudy of most nontrivial properties of particle physics.

We expect that, in\ngeneral, an arbitrary theta-state would be created in the heavy ion collisions,\nsimilar to the creation of the disoriented chiral condensate with an arbitrary\nisospin direction. It should be a large domain with a wrong $\\theta\\neq 0$\norientation. We test this idea numerically in a simple model where we study the\nevolution of the phases of the chiral condensates in QCD with two quark flavors\nwith non-zero theta-parameter.

Assuming rapid local\nthermalization, the evolution of such plasmas is computed using longitudinal\nboost-invariant 3+1-dimensional hydrodynamics. We compare the evolution in case\nthat the speed of sound in the plasma is constant to one resulting from an\nequation of state involving a strong first order transition, with a minimum of\nthe velocity of sound as a function of energy density. We find that azimuthally\nasymmetric fluctuations and correlations of the transverse energy flow can\ndevelop in both cases due to the initial inhomogeneities.

Bohr proposed to redefine the `objectivity' essential for\nscientific description in terms of the epistemological demand for unambiguously\ncommunicable descriptions of observational results, a move which has profound\nconsequences for how we can understand the concept of the quantum mechanical\nstate and the nature of the `system' which is `in' this state.
