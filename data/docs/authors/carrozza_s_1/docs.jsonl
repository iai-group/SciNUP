The\ngradient is defined with respect to a metric on the space of coupling constants\nwhich is explicitly known only to leading order in perturbation theory, but at\nthat order is positive semi-definite, as follows from Perelman's work on the\nRicci flow.

Because of this cancellation, regulation of the matter field\nzero-point energy density is not needed, and thus does not cause any trace\nanomaly to arise. We exhibit our results in two theories of gravity that are\nwell-defined quantum-mechanically. Both of these theories are locally conformal\ninvariant, quantum Einstein gravity in two dimensions and Weyl-tensor-based\nquantum conformal gravity in four dimensions (a fourth-order derivative quantum\ntheory of the type that Bender and Mannheim have recently shown to be\nghost-free and unitary). Central to our approach is the requirement that any\nand all departures of the geometry from Minkowski are to be brought about by\nquantum mechanics alone. Consequently, there have to be no fundamental\nclassical fields, and all mass scales have to be generated by dynamical\ncondensates. In such a situation the trace of the matter field energy-momentum\ntensor is zero, a constraint that obliges its cosmological constant and\nzero-point contributions to cancel each other identically, no matter how large\nthey might be. Quantization of the gravitational field is caused by its\ncoupling to quantized matter fields, with the gravitational field not needing\nany independent quantization of its own.

In the current project, each\nof the shockwaves correspond to a point-like Stress-Energy tensor that moves\nwith the speed of light while the collision is asymmetric and involves an\nimpact parameter (b). Our method is to expand the metric $(g_{\\mu \\nu})$ in the\nbackground of flat space-time in the presence of the two shockwaves and compute\ncorrections that satisfy causal boundary conditions taking into account\nback-reactions of the Stress-Energy tensor of the two point-like particles.

By viewing this 2D world as embedded in a 4D one, the 2D Green's\nfunction can also be seen to be sourced by a cylindrically symmetric scalar\nfield in 3D.

In the latter case, one is violating the semi-classical causal\nstructure of space, which is a strictly weaker implication than cloning or\nnon-monogamy. We show that the lack of monogamy that can emerge in evaporating\nspace times is one that is allowed in quantum mechanics, and is very naturally\nrelated to a lack of monogamy of correlations of outputs of measurements\nperformed at subsequent instances of time of a single system. A particular\nexample of this is the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal, and we argue that it\nneedn't lead to cloning or violations of entanglement monogamy.

The existence of black\nhole horizons which cover up the interior, including the singularity of the\nblack hole from outside observers, builds an information curtain, further\nhindering physicists from understanding the nature of the singularity and the\ninterior structure of black holes.

More specifically, we\ninsist on generalizing the two-dimensional notion of $p$-angulations to higher\ndimensions. To do so, we consider families of triangulations built out of\nsimplices with colored faces. Those simplices can be glued to form new building\nblocks, called bubbles which are pseudo-manifolds with boundaries. Bubbles can\nin turn be glued together to form triangulations. The main challenge is to\nclassify the triangulations built from a given set of bubbles with respect to\ntheir numbers of bubbles and simplices of codimension two. While the colored\ntriangulations which maximize the number of simplices of codimension two at\nfixed number of simplices are series-parallel objects called melonic\ntriangulations, this is not always true anymore when restricting attention to\ncolored triangulations built from specific bubbles. This opens up the\npossibility of new universality classes of colored triangulations. We present\nthree existing strategies to find those universality classes.

We examine this conflict\nmore carefully, by investigating implications of gauge (diffeomorphism)\ninvariance for observables in gravity. We prove a dressing theorem, showing\nthat any operator with nonzero Poincare charges, and in particular any\ncompactly-supported operator, in flat-spacetime quantum field theory must be\ngravitationally dressed once coupled to gravity, i.e. it must depend on the\nmetric at arbitrarily long distances, and we put lower bounds on this nonlocal\ndependence. This departure from standard locality occurs in the most severe way\npossible: in perturbation theory about flat spacetime, at leading order in\nNewton's constant. The physical observables in a gravitational theory therefore\ndo not organize themselves into local commuting subalgebras: the principle of\nlocality must apparently be reformulated or abandoned, and in fact we lack a\nclear definition of the coarser and more basic notion of a quantum subsystem of\nthe Universe.

We propose a new resolution\nto the paradox: this violation cannot be explicitly checked by an infalling\nobserver in the finite proper time they have to live after crossing the\nhorizon. Our resolution depends on a weak relaxation of the no-drama condition\n(we call it \"little drama\") which is the \"complementarity dual\" of scrambling\nof information on the stretched horizon. When translated to the description of\nthe black hole interior, this implies that the fine-grained quantum information\nof infalling matter is rapidly diffused across the entire interior while\nclassical observables and coarse-grained geometry remain unaffected. Under the\nassumption that information has diffused throughout the interior, we consider\nthe difficulty of the information-theoretic task that an observer must perform\nafter crossing the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole in order to\nverify a violation of monogamy of entanglement.

In this limit the perturbative expansion in the quartic coupling\nconstant, $g$, is dominated by a special class of \"melon\" diagrams. We study\n\"uncolored\" models of this type, which contain a single copy of real rank-$3$\ntensor. Its three indexes are distinguishable; therefore, the models possess\n$O(N)^3$ symmetry with the tensor field transforming in the tri-fundamental\nrepresentation. Such uncolored models also possess the large $N$ limit\ndominated by the melon diagrams. The quantum mechanics of a real anti-commuting\ntensor therefore has a similar large $N$ limit to the model recently introduced\nby Witten as an implementation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which does\nnot require disorder. Gauging the $O(N)^3$ symmetry in our quantum mechanical\nmodel removes the non-singlet states; therefore, one can search for its\nwell-defined gravity dual.

In quantum gravity, the\ngeometry of spacetime must be the analogously amplified information. Bulk local\nsemiclassical operators probe this information without disturbing it; these\ncorrespond to logical operators acting on code subspaces of the holographic\ntheory. From this viewpoint, we study how bulk local operators may be realized\nin a holographic theory of general spacetimes, which includes AdS/CFT as a\nspecial case, and deduce its consequences.

Instead,\nthe correct approach requires a transmutation of dynamical variables from the\nposition and momentum of a single particle to a field and its canonical\nmomentum. Particles, along with antiparticles, reappear in a very non-trivial\nmanner as the excitations of the field. The fact that one needs to adopt\ncompletely different languages to describe relativistic and non-relativistic\nfree particle implies that obtaining the NRQM limit of QFT is conceptually\nnon-trivial. I examine this limit in several approaches (like, for e.g.,\nHamiltonian dynamics, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian path integrals, field\ntheoretic description etc.) and identify the precise issues which arise when\none attempts to obtain the NRQM from QFT in each of these approaches. The\ndichotomy of description between NRQM and QFT does not originate just from the\nsquare root in the Hamiltonian or from the demand of Lorentz invariance, as it\nis sometimes claimed. The real difficulty has its origin in the necessary\nexistence of antiparticles to ensure a particular notion of relativistic\ncausality. Because of these conceptual issues, it turns out that one cannot, in\nfact, obtain some of the popular descriptions of NRQM by any sensible limiting\nprocedure applied to QFT. To obtain NRQM from QFT in a seamless manner, it is\nnecessary to work with NRQM expressed in a language closer to that of QFT.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

A colored building block is determined by its boundary triangulation,\nwhich in the case of polygons is simply characterized by its length. In three\ndimensions, colored building blocks are labeled by some 2D triangulations and\nthose homeomorphic to the 3-ball are labeled by the subset of planar ones.\nSimilarly to Euler's formula in 2D which provides an upper bound to the number\nof vertices at fixed number of polygons with given lengths, we look in three\ndimensions for an upper bound on the number of edges at fixed number of given\ncolored building blocks. In this article we solve this problem when all colored\nbuilding blocks, except possibly one, are homeomorphic to the 3-ball.

Since the axion condensate is coherently oscillating, it\ncan conceivably lead to parametric resonance of photons, leading to exponential\ngrowth in photon occupancy number and subsequent radio wave emission. We show\nthat while resonance always exists for spatially homogeneous condensates, its\nexistence for a spatially localized clump condensate depends sensitively on the\nsize of clump, strength of axion-photon coupling, and field amplitude. By\ndecomposing the electromagnetic field into vector spherical harmonics, we are\nable to numerically compute the resonance from clumps for arbitrary parameters.\nWe find that for spherically symmetric clumps, which are the true BEC ground\nstates, the resonance is absent for conventional values of the QCD axion-photon\ncoupling, but it is present for axions with moderately large couplings, or into\nhidden sector photons, or from scalar dark matter with repulsive interactions.\nWe extend these results to non-spherically symmetric clumps, organized by\nfinite angular momentum, and find that even QCD axion clumps with conventional\ncouplings can undergo resonant decay for sufficiently large angular momentum.\nWe discuss possible astrophysical consequences of these results, including the\nidea of a pile-up of clump masses and rapid electromagnetic emission in the sky\nfrom mergers. \n\n"}

Along the way we also prove a duality relation\nbetween two effective average actions computed with different UV cutoff\nprofiles.

In the setup of static spherically symmetric black hole spacetime,\nwe find that at the event horizon, the field equations of $f(R)$ gravity can be\nwritten into a form $dE = TdS - PdV + Td\\bar{S}$, where $T$ is the Hawking\ntemperature and $S=Af'(R)/4G$ is the horizon entropy of the black hole, $E$ is\nthe horizon energy of the black hole, $P$ is the radial pressure of matter, $V$\nis the volume of black hole horizon, and $d\\bar S$ can be interpreted as the\nentropy production term due to nonequilibrium thermodynamics of spacetime.

Guided by the physical principal of increasing symmetry\namong the four forces, we propose a different construction. Instead of defining\nthe transformation properties of a fundamental gauge field, we derive the gauge\ntheory from an embedding of a gauge fiber F=R^n or F=C^n into a trivial,\nembedding vector bundle F=R^N or F=C^N where N>n. Our new action is symmetric\nbetween the gauge theory and the Riemannian geometry.

There are, however, exceptions to the rule. This is\nbecause, in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, an operator is not necessarily\nself-adjoint even if its expectation values are real. Instead, the operator may\nbe merely symmetric. Such operators are not diagonalizable - and as a\nconsequence they describe real degrees of freedom which display a form of\n\"unsharpness\" or \"fuzzyness\". For example, there are indications that this type\nof operators could arise with the description of space-time at the string or at\nthe Planck scale, where some form of unsharpness or fuzzyness has long been\nconjectured.\n  A priori, however, a potential problem with merely symmetric operators is the\nfact that, unlike self-adjoint operators, they do not generate unitaries - at\nleast not straightforwardly. Here, we show for a large class of these operators\nthat they do generate unitaries in a well defined way, and that these operators\neven generate the entire unitary group of the Hilbert space. This shows that\nmerely symmetric operators, in addition to describing unsharp physical\nentities, may indeed also play a r{\\^o}le in the generation of symmetries, e.g.\nwithin a fundamental theory of quantum gravity. \n\n"}

In the\nconsidered SUSY QM both classical and quantum N=4 algebras include central\ncharges, and this opens various possibilities for partial supersymmetry\nbreaking.

Even as entanglement gains increasing importance in most\nquantum information processing protocols, its conceptual foundation is still\nwidely debated. Among the open questions are: What is the conceptual meaning of\nquantum entanglement? What are the most general constraints imposed by local\nrealism? Which general quantum states violate these constraints? Developing\nSchroedinger's ideas in an information-theoretic context we suggest that a\nnatural understanding of quantum entanglement results when one accepts (1) that\nthe amount of information per elementary system is finite and (2) that the\ninformation in a composite system resides more in the correlations than in\nproperties of individuals. The quantitative formulation of these ideas leads to\na rather natural criterion of quantum entanglement. Independently, extending\nBell's original ideas, we obtain a single general Bell inequality that\nsummarizes all possible constraints imposed by local realism on the\ncorrelations for a multi-particle system. Violation of the general Bell\ninequality results in an independent general criterion for quantum\nentanglement.

However, these fluctuations occur on time\nscales which are typically of the order of the light travel time between the\natom and the plate. As a consequence, they will not be observed in an\nexperiment which measures the force averaged over a much longer time. In the\nlarge time limit, the magnitude of the mean squared velocity of a test particle\ndue to this fluctuating Van der Waals force approaches a constant, and is\nsimilar to a Brownian motion of a test particle in an thermal bath with an\neffective temperature.
