Given a Lie group action that generates transport\nalong the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie\ngroup via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding\nLie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series.

This equation reflects the\nfact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is a sum of $p$\ncharacteristic functions of mutually disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$. This\nrefinement equation generates a MRA. The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our\nMRA is a 2-adic analog of the real Haar MRA. But in contrast to the real\nsetting, the refinable function generating our Haar MRA is 1-periodic, which\nnever holds for real refinable functions.

Realization of invariant\n  structures Abstract: Skew-symmetric differential forms play an unique role in mathematics and\nmathematical physics.

The concept of \"Exterior\ndifferential forms\" was introduced by E.Cartan for a notation of integrand\nexpressions, which can create the integral invariants.(The existence of\nintegral invariants was recognized by A.Poincare while studying the general\nequations of dynamics.)\n  All invariant mathematical formalisms are based on invariant properties of\nclosed exterior forms.

But, his Number-Theoretical achievements\n(See Books 7, 8 and 9 in his magnum opus \\emph{Elements} [1]) are rarely\nspoken. The object of this paper is to affirm the number-theoretical role of\nEuclid and the historical significance of Euclid's algorithm. It is known that\nalmost all elementary number-theoretical texts begin with Division algorithm.\nHowever, Euclid did not do like this. He began his number-theoretical work by\nintroducing his algorithm. We were quite surprised when we began to read the\n\\emph{Elements} for the first time. Nevertheless, one can prove that Euclid's\nalgorithm is essentially equivalent with the Bezout's equation and Division\nalgorithm. Therefore, Euclid has preliminarily established Theory of\nDivisibility and the greatest common divisor. This is the foundation of Number\nTheory. After more than 2000 years, by creatively introducing the notion of\ncongruence, Gauss published his \\emph{Disquisitiones Arithmeticae} in 1801 and\ndeveloped Number Theory as a systematic science. Note also that Euclid's\nalgorithm implies Euclid's first theorem (which is the heart of `the uniqueness\npart' of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic) and Euclid's second theorem\n(which states that there are infinitely many primes). Thus, in the nature of\nthings, Euclid's algorithm is the most important number-theoretical work of\nEuclid. For this reason, we further summarize briefly the influence of Euclid's\nalgorithm. Knuth said `we might call Euclid's method the granddaddy of all\nalgorithms'.

Second, we show that\nthe modularity function Q exhibits extreme degeneracies: it typically admits an\nexponential number of distinct high-scoring solutions and typically lacks a\nclear global maximum. Third, we derive the limiting behavior of the maximum\nmodularity Q_max for one model of infinitely modular networks, showing that it\ndepends strongly both on the size of the network and on the number of modules\nit contains. Finally, using three real-world metabolic networks as examples, we\nshow that the degenerate solutions can fundamentally disagree on many, but not\nall, partition properties such as the composition of the largest modules and\nthe distribution of module sizes. These results imply that the output of any\nmodularity maximization procedure should be interpreted cautiously in\nscientific contexts.

The approach works as follows: first, determine a\nconic formulation of the problem; second, determine its dual; third, apply\nsmoothing; and fourth, solve using an optimal first-order method. A merit of\nthis approach is its flexibility: for example, all compressed sensing problems\ncan be solved via this approach. These include models with objective\nfunctionals such as the total-variation norm, ||Wx||_1 where W is arbitrary, or\na combination thereof. In addition, the paper also introduces a number of\ntechnical contributions such as a novel continuation scheme, a novel approach\nfor controlling the step size, and some new results showing that the smooth and\nunsmoothed problems are sometimes formally equivalent. Combined with our\nframework, these lead to novel, stable and computationally efficient\nalgorithms.

If M is linearly ordered by <, we will say that the\nlinear ordering (M,<) characterizes kappa. It is known that if kappa is\ncharacterizable, then kappa plus is characterizable by a linear ordering. Also,\nif kappa is characterizable by a dense linear ordering with an increasing\nsequence of size kappa, then 2^kappa is characterizable. We show that if kappa\nis homogeneously characterizable, then kappa is characterizable by a dense\nlinear ordering, while the converse fails.\n  The main theorems are: 1) If kappa>2^lambda is a characterizable cardinal,\nlambda is characterizable by a dense linear ordering and lambda is the least\ncardinal such that kappa^lambda>kappa, then kappa^lambda is also\ncharacterizable, 2) if aleph_alpha and kappa^(aleph_alpha) are characterizable\ncardinals, then the same is true for kappa^(aleph_(alpha+beta)), for all\ncountable beta.

{"id": "1205.4133", "contents": "Title: Constrained Overcomplete Analysis Operator Learning for Cosparse Signal\n  Modelling Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a low-dimensional signal model from a\ncollection of training samples. The mainstream approach would be to learn an\novercomplete dictionary to provide good approximations of the training samples\nusing sparse synthesis coefficients. This famous sparse model has a less well\nknown counterpart, in analysis form, called the cosparse analysis model. In\nthis new model, signals are characterised by their parsimony in a transformed\ndomain using an overcomplete (linear) analysis operator. We propose to learn an\nanalysis operator from a training corpus using a constrained optimisation\nframework based on L1 optimisation. The reason for introducing a constraint in\nthe optimisation framework is to exclude trivial solutions. Although there is\nno final answer here for which constraint is the most relevant constraint, we\ninvestigate some conventional constraints in the model adaptation field and use\nthe uniformly normalised tight frame (UNTF) for this purpose. We then derive a\npractical learning algorithm, based on projected subgradients and\nDouglas-Rachford splitting technique, and demonstrate its ability to robustly\nrecover a ground truth analysis operator, when provided with a clean training\nset, of sufficient size. We also find an analysis operator for images, using\nsome noisy cosparse signals, which is indeed a more realistic experiment. As\nthe derived optimisation problem is not a convex program, we often find a local\nminimum using such variational methods. Some local optimality conditions are\nderived for two different settings, providing preliminary theoretical support\nfor the well-posedness of the learning problem under appropriate conditions. \n\n"}

One of the principal reasons for the\nimportance of PSWFs is that they are a natural and efficient tool for computing\nwith bandlimited functions, that frequently occur in the abovementioned areas.\nThis is due to the fact that PSWFs are the eigenfunctions of the integral\noperator, that represents timelimiting followed by lowpassing.\n  Needless to say, the behavior of this operator is governed by the decay rate\nof its eigenvalues. Therefore, investigation of this decay rate plays a crucial\nrole in the related theory and applications - for example, in construction of\nquadratures, interpolation, filter design, etc.\n  The significance of PSWFs and, in particular, of the decay rate of the\neigenvalues of the associated integral operator, was realized at least half a\ncentury ago. Nevertheless, perhaps surprisingly, despite vast numerical\nexperience and existence of several asymptotic expansions, a non-trivial\nexplicit upper bound on the magnitude of the eigenvalues has been missing for\ndecades.\n  The principal goal of this paper is to close this gap in the theory of PSWFs.\nWe analyze the integral operator associated with PSWFs, to derive fairly tight\nnon-asymptotic upper bounds on the magnitude of its eigenvalues.

Indeed, in order to prove Four-Color Conjecture, it clearly\nsuffices to show that all maximal planar graphs are 4-colorable. Since this\nconjecture was proposed in 1852, no mathematical proofs have been invented up\nuntil now. Maybe the main reasons lie in the following three aspects in terms\nof maximal planar graphs: not clearing up the structures, not figuring out the\ncoloring types, and not straightening out the relation between structure and\ncoloring. For this, we will write a series of articles to study the structure\nand coloring theory of maximal planar graphs systematically.

The criterion used in this paper to answer this question is the\nrate of convergence of the error of the reduced order model with respect to the\nnumber of proper orthogonal decomposition basis functions. Two cases are\nconsidered: the no_DQ case, in which the snapshot difference quotients are not\nused, and the DQ case, in which the snapshot difference quotients are used. The\nerror estimates suggest that the convergence rates in the $C^0(L^2)$-norm and\nin the $C^0(H^1)$-norm are optimal for the DQ case, but suboptimal for the\nno_DQ case. The convergence rates in the $L^2(H^1)$-norm are optimal for both\nthe DQ case and the no_DQ case. Numerical tests are conducted on the heat\nequation and on the Burgers equation. The numerical results support the\nconclusions drawn from the theoretical error estimates. Overall, the\ntheoretical and numerical results strongly suggest that, in order to achieve\noptimal pointwise in time rates of convergence with respect to the number of\nproper orthogonal decomposition basis functions, one should use the snapshot\ndifference quotients. \n\n"}

The underlying idea of asynchronous methods is to avoid processor\nidle time by allowing the processors to continue to make progress even if not\nall progress made by other processors has been communicated to them.\n  Historically, the applicability of asynchronous methods for solving linear\nequations was limited to certain restricted classes of matrices, such as\ndiagonally dominant matrices. Furthermore, analysis of these methods focused on\nproving convergence in the limit. Comparison of the asynchronous convergence\nrate with its synchronous counterpart and its scaling with the number of\nprocessors were seldom studied, and are still not well understood.\n  In this paper, we propose a randomized shared-memory asynchronous method for\ngeneral symmetric positive definite matrices. We rigorously analyze the\nconvergence rate and prove that it is linear, and is close to that of the\nmethod's synchronous counterpart if the processor count is not excessive\nrelative to the size and sparsity of the matrix. We also present an algorithm\nfor unsymmetric systems and overdetermined least-squares. Our work presents a\nsignificant improvement in the applicability of asynchronous linear solvers as\nwell as in their convergence analysis, and suggests randomization as a key\nparadigm to serve as a foundation for asynchronous methods. \n\n"}

This dispersion is a macroscopic effect of microscopic\ndiffraction caused by spatial variation in the sound speed. We analyze this\ndispersive effect by using high-order homogenization to derive an anisotropic,\ndispersive effective medium. We generalize to two dimensions a homogenization\napproach that has been used previously for one-dimensional problems.\nPseudospectral solutions of the effective medium equations agree to high\naccuracy with finite volume direct numerical simulations of the\nvariable-coefficient equations. \n\n"}

As a prototypical example, the Andrade model is chosen for its\nsimplicity and its satisfactory fits of experimental flow laws in rocks and\nmetals.

Our analysis focuses on the successive\nprojection algorithm (SPA), a simple, efficient and provably robust algorithm\nin the pure-pixel algorithm class. Recently, a provably robust preconditioning\nwas proposed by Gillis and Vavasis (arXiv:1310.2273) which requires the\nresolution of a semidefinite program (SDP) to find a data points-enclosing\nminimum volume ellipsoid. Since solving the SDP in high precisions can be time\nconsuming, we generalize the robustness analysis to approximate solutions of\nthe SDP, that is, solutions whose objective function values are some\nmultiplicative factors away from the optimal value.

Much of the past work considers graph\nevolution algorithms known as Achlioptas processes in which a single edge is\nadded to the graph from a set of $k$ randomly chosen candidate edges at each\ntimestep until a giant component emerges. Several Achlioptas processes seem to\nyield a discontinuous percolation transition, but it was proven by Riordan and\nWarnke that the transition must be continuous in the thermodynamic limit.\nHowever, they also proved that if the number $k(n)$ of candidate edges\nincreases with the number of nodes, then the percolation transition may be\ndiscontinuous. Here we attempt to find the simplest such process which yields a\ndiscontinuous transition in the thermodynamic limit. We introduce a process\nwhich considers only the degree of candidate edges and not component size.

A critical issue is to rigorously bound the error of\nsuch approximations, not with respect to a fixed finite dimensional discrete\nbackground problem, but with respect to the exact solution of the continuous\nproblem. While the energy norm offers a natural error measure corresponding to\nthe underlying operator considered as an isomorphism from the energy space onto\nits dual, this norm requires a careful treatment in its interplay with the\ntensor structure of the problem.

Naturally one expects that the new physics will impact\nrelated inverse problems in terms of uniqueness, stability, and degree of\nill-posedness. The last aspect is especially important from a practical point\nof view, i.e., stably reconstructing the quantities of interest.\n  In this paper, we employ a formal analytic and numerical way to examine the\ndegree of ill-posedness of several \"classical\" inverse problems for fractional\ndifferential equations involving a Djrbashian-Caputo fractional derivative in\neither time or space, which represent the fractional analogues of that for\nclassical integral order differential equations.

For template matching (template deformation), the\nEuler-Lagrangian equation, arising from minimizing an energy function, falls\ninto the Euler-Poincar\\'e theory and can be recast into the EP equations.

In particular, it was\nnoticed by Mandelbrot that empirical log-returns distributions are more\nconcentrated around the origin and have considerably heavier tails. This\nsuggests to adjust the Black-Scholes model by the introduction of the Levy\nprocesses instead of Brownian ones. This approach has been extensively studied\nin a univariate setup since the nineties. In the multivariate settings the\ntheory is not so advanced.

These methods are able\nto manipulate arbitrary distributions (either discrete or continuous) by simply\nrequiring to be able to draw samples from them, which is the typical setup in\nhigh-dimensional learning problems. This alleviates the need to discretize\nthese densities, while giving access to provably convergent methods that output\nthe correct distance without discretization error. These algorithms rely on two\nmain ideas: (a) the dual OT problem can be re-cast as the maximization of an\nexpectation ; (b) entropic regularization of the primal OT problem results in a\nsmooth dual optimization optimization which can be addressed with algorithms\nthat have a provably faster convergence.

It inherits its robustness and accelerates\nits convergence rate computing a set of $P$ relaxation factors that result from\na minimization problem. In a typical SRJ scheme, the former set of factors is\nemployed in cycles of $M$ consecutive iterations until a prescribed tolerance\nis reached. We present the analytic form for the optimal set of relaxation\nfactors for the case in which all of them are different, and find that the\nresulting algorithm is equivalent to a non-stationary generalized Richardson's\nmethod. Our method to estimate the weights has the advantage that the explicit\ncomputation of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ is\nreplaced by the (much easier) calculation of the maximum and minimum\nfrequencies derived from a von Neumann analysis. This set of weights is also\noptimal for the general problem, resulting in the fastest convergence of all\npossible SRJ schemes for a given grid structure.

Since the degree of freedom is typically much larger than the\nconstraints imposed by the image observations, the straightforward formulation\nof optical flow as an inverse problem is ill-posed. Standard approaches to\ndetermine optical flow rely on formulating and solving an optimization problem\nthat contains both a data fidelity term and a regularization term, the latter\neffectively resolves the otherwise ill-posedness of the inverse problem. In\nthis work, we depart from the deterministic formalism, and instead treat\noptical flow as a statistical inverse problem.

We show that smooth, multivariate functions\npossess expansions in orthogonal polynomial bases that are not only\napproximately sparse, but possess a particular type of structured sparsity\ndefined by so-called lower sets. This structure can be exploited via the use of\nweighted $\\ell^1$ minimization techniques, and, as we demonstrate, doing so\nleads to sample complexity estimates that are at most logarithmically dependent\non the dimension $d$. Hence the curse of dimensionality - the bane of\nhigh-dimensional approximation - is mitigated to a significant extent. We also\ndiscuss several practical issues, including unknown noise (due to truncation or\nnumerical error), and highlight a number of open problems and challenges. \n\n"}

In one spatial dimension, the hyperbolic monodomain model is\nequivalent to a cable model that includes axial inductances, and the relaxation\ntimes of the Cattaneo fluxes are strictly related to these inductances. A\npurely linear analysis shows that the inductances are negligible, but models of\ncardiac electrophysiology are highly nonlinear, and linear predictions may not\ncapture the fully nonlinear dynamics. In fact, contrary to the linear analysis,\nwe show that for simple nonlinear ionic models, an increase in conduction\nvelocity is obtained for small and moderate values of the relaxation time.

Quantum coherence has recently\nbeen investigated rigorously within a resource-theoretic formalism. However,\nthe finer-grained notion of multilevel coherence, which explicitly takes into\naccount the number of superposed classical states, has remained relatively\nunexplored. A comprehensive analysis of multi-level coherence, which acts as\nthe single-party analogue to multi-partite entanglement, is essential for\nunderstanding natural quantum processes as well as for gauging the performance\nof quantum technologies. Here we develop the theoretical and experimental\ngroundwork for characterizing and quantifying multilevel coherence. We prove\nthat non-trivial levels of purity are required for multilevel coherence, as\nthere is a ball of states around the maximally mixed state that do not exhibit\nmultilevel coherence in any basis.

When\nthe problem dimension is large, computational and/or memory constraints make it\ndesirable, or even necessary, to perform the task in a distributed fashion. In\nthis paper, we consider a common scenario in which a taskmaster intends to\nsolve a large-scale system of linear equations by distributing subsets of the\nequations among a number of computing machines/cores. We propose an accelerated\ndistributed consensus algorithm, in which at each iteration every machine\nupdates its solution by adding a scaled version of the projection of an error\nsignal onto the nullspace of its system of equations, and where the taskmaster\nconducts an averaging over the solutions with momentum.

We start with elementary\nconcepts like density, clusters, or paths, and derive from them more advanced\nconcepts like cliques, degrees, clustering coefficients, or connected\ncomponents. We obtain a language to directly deal with interactions over time,\nsimilar to the language provided by graphs to deal with relations.

While certain one\nand two parameter fits have previously been considered in detail, we establish\na framework for the detailed discussion of the full 6d fit. We visualize and\nquantify the 6d $1\\sigma$ region around the best fit point and define fit\nuncertainties for both current and future observables. We then define metrics\nquantifying the deviations between measurements and both SM and best fit\npredictions. These metrics relate observables to directions in parameter space,\nrevealing their precise role in the fit, thus providing guidance for future\ntheoretical and experimental work. Some metrics further quantify the role of\ncorrelated uncertainties, which turns out to be significant. For example the\nrelevance of angular observables such as $P_5^\\prime$ is reduced in this\ncontext. Finally, studying the space of observables allows us to discuss the\ninternal tensions in the fit. \n\n"}

In this\npaper, we explore the theoretical aspects of exponential Runge-Kutta (RK) and\nlinear multistep (LM) methods, in particular, the stability and convergence of\nthese methods via the transfer matrix formulation.

The proposed technique extends\nthe reduced-order-model error surrogates (ROMES) method to closure modeling.\nThe original ROMES method applied Gaussian-process regression to construct a\nstatistical model that maps cheaply computable error indicators (e.g., residual\nnorm, dual-weighted residuals) to a random variable for either (1) the norm of\nthe state error or (2) the error in a scalar-valued quantity of interest.\nRather than target these two types of errors, this work proposes to construct a\nstatistical model for the state error itself; it achieves this by constructing\nstatistical models for the generalized coordinates characterizing both the\nin-plane error (i.e., the error in the trial subspace) and a low-dimensional\napproximation of the out-of-plane error. The former can be considered a\nstatistical closure model, as it quantifies the error in the ROM generalized\ncoordinates. Because any quantity of interest can be computed as a functional\nof the state, the proposed approach enables any quantity-of-interest error to\nbe statistically quantified a posteriori, as the state-error model can be\npropagated through the associated quantity-of-interest functional.

(Properties of skew-symmetric differential forms) Abstract: Identical relations occur in various branches of mathematics and mathematical\nphysics. The Cauchy-Riemann relations, characteristical and canonical\nrelations, the Bianchi identities and others are examples of identical\nrelations. It can be shown that all these relations express either the\nconditions of closure of exterior (skew-symmetric) differential forms and\ncorresponding dual forms or the properties of closed exterior forms. Since the\nclosed differential forms are invariant under all transformations, which\nconserve the differential (these are gauge transformations: unitary, canonical,\ngradient and others), from this it follows that identical relations are a\nmathematical representation of relevant invariant and covariant objects.\n  The theory of exterior differential forms cannot answer the question of how\ndo invariant objects appear and what does these objects generate?\n  The answer to this question can be obtained using the skew-symmetric\ndifferential forms, which possess the evolutionary properties. The mathematical\napparatus of such evolutionary forms contains nonidentical relations, from\nwhich the identical relations corresponding to invariant objects are obtained\nwith the help of degenerate transformations.

Abstract: The first crisis in the geometry arose in the beginning of XIXth century,\nwhen the mathematicians rejected the non-Euclidean geometry as a possible\ngeometry of the real world. Now we observe unreasonable rejection of the\nnon-Riemannian geometry by the official representatives of the contemporary\ngeometry. Class of the Riemannian geometries appears to be too narrow for\nphysical applications. The microcosm physics needs expansion of the class of\npossible geometries appropriate for the role of space-time geometry. In the\nframework of the non-Riemannian geometry one can construct the space-time\ngeometry, where the motion of free particles is primordially stochastic, and\nthis stochasticity depends on the particle mass. At the same time the geometry\nin itself is not stochastic in the sense that the space-time intervals are\ndeterministic. Principles of quantum mechanics can be deduced from such a\nspace-time geometry. The crisis situation in geometry appears to be connected\nwith some preconceptions concerning the foundation of the geometry. The\npreconceptions as well as the crisis generated by them are not purely\nscientific phenomena. The human factor (social aspect) is rather strong in the\ncrisis phenomena.

Constructive\nreal analysis in NAFL (NRA) is accomplished by a translation of diagrammatic\nconcepts from Euclidean geometry into an extension (NPAR) of the NAFL version\nof Peano Arithmetic (NPA). Such a translation is possible because NPA proves\nthe existence of every infinite proper class of natural numbers that is\ndefinable in the language of NPA. Infinite sets are not permitted in NPAR and\nquantification over proper classes is banned; hence Cantor's diagonal argument\ncannot be legally formulated in NRA, and there is no `cardinality' for any\ncollection (`super-class') of real numbers.

Stochastic centre manifold theory provides novel support for\ncoarse grained, macroscale, spatial discretisations of nonlinear stochastic\npartial differential or difference equations such as the example of the\nstochastically forced Burgers' equation. Dividing the physical domain into\nfinite length overlapping elements empowers the approach to resolve fully\ncoupled dynamical interactions between neighbouring elements.

All other\njoint strategies are considered impossible; the only issue is what equilibrium\nconcept is \"correct\". This hypothesis violates the desiderata underlying\nprobability theory. Indeed, probability theory renders moot the problem of what\nequilibrium concept is correct - every joint strategy can arise with non-zero\nprobability. Rather than a first-principles derivation of an equilibrium\nconcept, game theory requires a first-principles derivation of a distribution\nover joint (mixed) strategies. This paper shows how information theory can\nprovide such a distribution over joint strategies. If a scientist external to\nthe game wants to distill such a distribution to a point prediction, that\nprediction should be set by decision theory, using their (!) loss function. So\nthe predicted joint strategy - the \"equilibrium concept\" - varies with the\nexternal scientist's loss function. It is shown here that in many games, having\na probability distribution with support restricted to Nash equilibria - as\nstipulated by conventional game theory - is impossible. It is also show how to:\ni) Derive an information-theoretic quantification of a player's degree of\nrationality; ii) Derive bounded rationality as a cost of computation; iii)\nElaborate the close formal relationship between game theory and statistical\nphysics; iv) Use this relationship to extend game theory to allow\nstochastically varying numbers of players. \n\n"}
