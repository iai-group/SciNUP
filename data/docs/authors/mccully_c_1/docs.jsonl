This multitude of scales calls for\nobjective methods to find and classify star-forming regions, regardless of\nspatial size. To this end, we present an analysis of star-forming groups in the\nlocal group spiral galaxy M33, based on a new implementation of the Minimum\nSpanning Tree (MST) method. Unlike previous studies which limited themselves to\na single spatial scale, we study star-forming structures from the effective\nresolution limit (~20pc) to kpc scales. We find evidence for a continuum of\nstar-forming group sizes, from pc to kpc scales. We do not find a\ncharacteristic scale for OB associations, unlike that found in previous\nstudies, and we suggest that the appearance of such a scale was caused by\nspatial resolution and selection effects. The luminosity function of the groups\nis found to be well represented by a power-law with an index, -2, similar to\nthat found for clusters and GMCs. Additionally, the groups follow a similar\nmass-radius relation as GMCs. The size distribution of the groups is best\ndescribed by a log-normal distribution and we show that within a hierarchical\ndistribution, if a scale is selected to find structure, the resulting size\ndistribution will have a log-normal distribution. We find an abrupt drop of the\nnumber of groups outside a galactic radius of ~4kpc, suggesting a change in the\nstructure of the star-forming ISM, possibly reflected in the lack of GMCs\nbeyond this radius.

The LSST design is\ndriven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking\nan inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and\nmapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited at\nCerro Pach\\'{o}n in northern Chile.

The evolution of the mass-metallicity relation at z>3 Abstract: We present initial results of an ESO-VLT large programme (AMAZE) aimed at\ndetermining the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation at z>3 by means of\ndeep near-IR spectroscopy. Gas metallicities are measured, for an initial\nsample of nine star forming galaxies at z~3.5, by means of optical nebular\nlines redshifted into the near-IR. Stellar masses are accurately determined by\nusing Spitzer-IRAC data, which sample the rest-frame near-IR stellar light in\nthese distant galaxies. When compared with previous surveys, the\nmass-metallicity relation inferred at z~3.5 shows an evolution much stronger\nthan observed at lower redshifts. The evolution is prominent even in massive\ngalaxies, indicating that z~3 is an epoch of major action in terms of star\nformation and metal enrichment also for massive systems. There are also\nindications that the metallicity evolution of low mass galaxies is stronger\nrelative to high mass systems, an effect which can be considered the chemical\nversion of the galaxy downsizing. The mass-metallicity relation observed at\nz~3.5 is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of some hierarchical\nevolutionary models.

These findings are further supported by the variations of\nthe pulse profiles, which clearly show the presence of the secondary maximum at\nthe late stages of the outburst after October 29. This fact can be interpreted\nas the disc receding sufficiently far from the neutron star to open the view of\nthe lower magnetic pole.

This suggests that with a suitable weighting a\nsimilar effect may be achieved for galaxies, suppressing their shot noise.

Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar\npopulation synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3\nMsol/yr, an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of ~2x10^11 Msol. We detect\nseveral faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [NII]/Halpha,\n[SII]/Halpha and [OII]/[OIII] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line\nregions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies\nactive star formation. The current SFR is <1% of the past average SFR. If this\ngalaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z=2, it implies\nthat quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that\nlow luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects.\nNuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we\nshow that the AGN contributes <8% to the rest-frame optical emission. A\npossible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly;\nalthough a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up <10% of the total stellar\nmass, it could account for up to ~40% of the optical light. Nevertheless, this\nspectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellar\npopulation. \n\n"}

The surface as well as vertical distribution of\nRRLS in the inner Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are studied to understand\nwhether these stars are actually formed in the halo. RRLS identified by the\nOGLE III survey are used to estimate their number density distribution. The\nscale-height of their distribution is estimated using extinction corrected\naverage magnitudes of ab type stars. The density distribution mimics the bar,\nconfirming results in the literature. The distribution of their scale height\nindicates that there may be two populations, one with smaller scale-height,\nvery similar to the red clump stars and the other, much larger. The\ndistribution of the reddening-corrected magnitude along the minor axis shows\nvariation, suggesting an inclination. The inclination is estimated to be i =\n31.3 (3.5) degrees, very similar to the inclination of the disk.

The IRS spectral mapping data allow us to\nbuild spectral maps of the bright mid-IR emission lines (e.g., [NeII], [NeIII],\n[SIII], H_2), continuum, the 6.2 and 11.3micron PAH features, and the 9.7micron\nsilicate feature, as well as to extract 1D spectra for regions of interest in\neach galaxy. The IRS data are used to obtain spatially resolved measurements of\nthe extinction using the 9.7micron silicate feature, and to trace star forming\nregions using the neon lines and the PAH features. We also investigate a number\nof AGN indicators, including the presence of high excitation emission lines and\na strong dust continuum emission at around 6micron. We finally use the\nintegrated Spitzer/IRS spectra as templates of local LIRGs. We discuss several\npossible uses for these templates, including the calibration of the star\nformation rate of IR-bright galaxies at high redshift. We also predict the\nintensities of the brightest mid-IR emission lines for LIRGs as a function of\nredshift, and compare them with the expected sensitivities of future space IR\nmissions. \n\n"}

In this\nreview we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric\ncomposition.

Abstract: We investigate two potential mechanisms that will produce X-ray and gamma-ray\nflashes from Type Ia supernovae (SN-Ia). The mechanisms are the breakout of the\nthermonuclear burning front as it reaches the surface of the white dwarf and\nthe interaction of the rapidly expanding envelope with an accretion disk. Based\non the delayed-detonation scenario and detailed radiation-hydro calculation\nwhich include nuclear networks, we find that both mechanisms produce ~1 second\nflashes of high energy radiation with peak luminosities of 10^48 to 10^50\nerg/sec with fast rises and exponential declines. The X- and gamma-ray\nvisibility of a SN-Ia will depend strongly on self absorption within the\nprogenitor system, specifically on the properties of the accretion disk and its\norientation towards the observer. Such X-ray and gamma-ray flashes could be\ndetected as triggered events by Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) detectors on satellites,\nwith events in current GRB catalogs. We have searched through the GRB catalogs\n(for the BATSE, HETE, and Swift experiments) for GRBs that occur at the\nextrapolated time of explosion and in the correct direction for known Type Ia\nsupernovae with radial velocity of less than 3,000 km/s. For BATSE about\n12.9+-3.6 nearby SNe Ia should have been detected, but only 0.8+-0.7\nnon-coincidental matches have been found. With the HETE and Swift satellites,\nwe expect to see 5.6+-1.3 SN-Ia flashes from known nearby SNe Ia but, yet, no\nSN-Ia flashes were detected. These place observational limits that the\nbolometric peak luminosity of SN-Ia Flashes must be less ~10^46 erg/s. We\nattribute the difference between theory and observational limits to the\nabsorption of the X- and gamma-rays by the accretion disk of large scale height\nor common envelope that would be smothering the white dwarf. \n\n"}

This is the largest sample of GRB\nafterglow spectral energy distributions thus far studied, providing a strong\nhandle on the optical depth distribution of soft X-ray absorption and\ndust-extinction systems in GRB host galaxies. We detect an absorption system\nwithin the GRB host galaxy in 79% of the sample, and an extinction system in\n71% of the sample, and find the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction law to\nprovide an acceptable fit to the host galaxy extinction profile for the\nmajority of cases, consistent with previous findings. The range in the soft\nX-ray absorption to dust-extinction ratio, N_{H,X}/Av, in GRB host galaxies\nspans almost two orders of magnitude, and the typical ratios are significantly\nlarger than those of the Magellanic Clouds or Milky Way. Although dust\ndestruction could be a cause, at least in part, for the large N_{H,X}/Av\nratios, the good fit provided by the SMC extinction law for the majority of our\nsample suggests that there is an abundance of small dust grains in the GRB\nenvironment, which we would expect to have been destroyed if dust destruction\nwere responsible for the large N_{H,X}/Av ratios.

We examine the properties of these\nBH-BH binaries through direct N-body simulations of star clusters using the\nGPU-enabled NBODY6 code. We perform simulations of N <= 10^5 Plummer clusters\nof low-mass stars with an initial population of BHs.

Abstract: Many young extra-galactic clusters have a measured velocity dispersion that\nis too high for the mass derived from their age and total luminosity, which has\nled to the suggestion that they are not in virial equilibrium. Most of these\nclusters are confined to a narrow age range centred around 10 Myr because of\nobservational constraints. At this age the cluster light is dominated by\nluminous evolved stars, such as red supergiants, with initial masses of ~13-22\nMsun for which (primordial) binarity is high. In this study we investigate to\nwhat extent the observed excess velocity dispersion is the result of the\norbital motions of binaries. We demonstrate that estimates for the dynamical\nmass of young star clusters, derived from the observed velocity dispersion,\nexceed the photometric mass by up-to a factor of 10 and are consistent with a\nconstant offset in the square of the velocity dispersion. This can be\nreproduced by models of virialised star clusters hosting a massive star\npopulation of which ~25 is in binaries, with typical mass ratios of ~0.6 and\nperiods of ~1000 days. We conclude that binaries play a pivotal role in\nderiving the dynamical masses of young (~10 Myr) moderately massive and compact\n(<1e5 Msun; > 1 pc) star clusters. \n\n"}

We study a toy model where the flow behind a planar\nstationary accretion shock is adiabatically decelerated by an external\npotential. Two magnetic field geometries are considered: parallel or\nperpendicular to the shock. The entropy-vorticity wave, which is simply\nadvected in the unmagnetized limit, separates into five different waves: the\nentropy perturbations are advected, while the vorticity can propagate along the\nfield lines through two Alfven waves and two slow magnetosonic waves. The two\ncycles existing in the unmagnetized limit, advective-acoustic and purely\nacoustic, are replaced by up to six distinct MHD cycles. The phase differences\namong the cycles play an important role in determining the total cycle\nefficiency and hence the growth rate.

This implies that most of the residual star formation in\nearly-type galaxies is centrally concentrated. Blue-cored galaxies are\npredominantly low velocity dispersion systems. A simple model shows that the\nobserved positive color gradients (blue-cored) are visible only for a billion\nyears after a star formation episode for the typical strength of recent star\nformation.

Abstract: [abridged]\n  Context: Very few examples of luminous blue variable (LBV) stars or LBV\ncandidates (LBVc) are known, particularly at metallicities below the SMC. The\nLBV phase is crucial for the evolution of massive stars, and its behavior with\nmetallicity is poorly known. V39 in IC 1613 is a well-known photometric\nvariable, with B-band changes larger than 1mag. over its period. The star,\npreviously proposed to be a projection of a Galactic W Virginis and an IC 1613\nred supergiant, shows features that render it a possible LBVc.\n  Method: We investigate mid-resolution blue and red VLT-VIMOS spectra of V39,\ncovering a time span of 40 days, and perform a quantitative analysis of the\ncombined spectrum using the model atmosphere code CMFGEN.\n  Results: We identify strong Balmer and FeII P-Cygni profiles, and a hybrid\nspectrum resembling a B-A supergiant in the blue and a G-star in the red. No\nsignificant Vrad variations are detected, and the spectral changes are small\nover the photometric period. Our analysis places V39 in the low-luminosity part\nof the LBV and LBVc region, but it is also consistent with a sgB[e] star.\n  Conclusions: The radial velocity indicates that V39 belongs to IC 1613. The\nlack of Vrad changes and spectroscopic variations excludes binary scenarios.\nThe features observed are not consistent with a W Virginis star, and this\npossibility is also discarded. We propose that the star is a B-A LBVc or sgB[e]\nstar surrounded by a thick disk precessing around it.\n  If confirmed, V39 would be the lowest metallicity resolved LBV candidate\nknown to date.

Our parameter study explores how the emergent luminosity depends on a\nrange of circumstellar shell masses, velocities, geometries, and wind mass-loss\nrates, as well as variations in the SN mass and energy. We find that the shell\nmass is the most important parameter, in the sense that higher shell masses (or\nhigher ratios of M_shell/M_SN) lead to higher peak luminosities and higher\nefficiencies in converting shock energy into visual light. Lower mass shells\ncan also cause high peak luminosities if the shell is slow or if the SN ejecta\nare very fast, but only for a short time. Sustaining a high luminosity for\ndurations of more than 100 days requires massive circumstellar shells of order\n10 M_sun or more.

In favour for the search of such a phase transition in\nnature, we construct an equation of state for strange quark matter based on the\nMIT bag model. We apply this equation of state to highly asymmetric core\ncollapse supernova matter with finite temperatures and large baryon densities.\nThe phase transition is constructed using the general Gibbs conditions, which\nresults in an extended coexistence region between the pure hadronic and pure\nquark phases in the phase diagram, i.e. the mixed phase. The supernovae are\nsimulated via general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics based on three\nflavor Boltzmann neutrino transport in spherical symmetry. During the dynamical\nevolution temperatures above 10 MeV, baryon densities above nuclear saturation\ndensity and a proton-to-baryon ratio below 0.2 are obtained. At these\nconditions the phase transition is triggered which leads to a significant\nsoftening of the EoS for matter in the mixed phase.

The\nlow and fairly constant SN Ia rate out to z~1 implies that the bulk of the iron\nmass in clusters was already in place by z~1.

The jet breakout is possible even if the Pop\nIII star has a supergiant hydrogen envelope without mass loss, thanks to the\nlong-lived powerful accretion of the envelope itself. While the Pop III GRB is\nestimated to be energetic, E_{gamma,iso} ~ 10^{55} erg, the supergiant envelope\nhides the initial bright phase into the cocoon component, leading to a GRB with\na long duration ~ 1000(1+z) sec and an ordinary isotropic luminosity ~ 10^{52}\nerg s^{-1} (~ 10^{-9} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} at redshift z ~ 20).

The\nkey ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on\nrelatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or\nlarger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a\nconfiguration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to\nsubstantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral\ngrazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic\nencounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the\nphotosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary\nstar increasing its own radius. This is motivated by the case of $\\eta$\nCarinae, where such a collision must have occured if conventional estimates of\nthe present-day orbit are correct, and where brief peaks in the light curve\ncoincide with periastron.

In this paper we compare two methods for making this determination in\ncosmological simulations where the internal structures of molecular clouds are\nunresolved: a complex time-dependent chemistry network coupled to a radiative\ntransfer calculation of the dissociating ultraviolet (UV) radiation field, and\na simple time-independent analytic approximation. We show that these two\nmethods produce excellent agreement at all metallicities >~10^-2 of the Milky\nWay value across a very wide range of UV fields. At lower metallicities the\nagreement is worse, likely because time-dependent effects become important;\nhowever, there are no observational calibrations of molecular gas content at\nsuch low metallicities, so it is unclear if either method is accurate. The\ncomparison suggests that, in many but not all applications, the analytic\napproximation provides a viable and nearly cost-free alternative to full\ntime-dependent chemistry and radiative transfer. \n\n"}

The Coma cluster is\none of the nearest truly massive galaxy clusters, and is host to a\ncorrespondingly large system of globular clusters (GCs). We use imaging from\nthe HST/ACS Coma Cluster Survey to present the first definitive detection of a\nlarge population of intracluster GCs (IGCs) that fills the Coma cluster core\nand is not associated with individual galaxies. The GC surface density profile\naround the central massive elliptical galaxy, NGC 4874, is dominated at large\nradii by a population of IGCs that extend to the limit of our data (R<520 kpc).\nWe estimate that there are 47000+/-1600 (random) +4000/-5000 (systematic) IGCs\nout to this radius, and that they make up ~70% of the central GC system, making\nthis the largest GC system in the nearby Universe. Even including the GC\nsystems of other cluster galaxies, IGCs still make up ~30-45% of the GCs in the\ncluster core. Observational limits from previous studies of the intracluster\nlight (ICL) suggest that the IGC population has a high specific frequency. If\nthe IGC population has a specific frequency similar to high-S_N dwarf galaxies,\nthen the ICL has a total stellar mass of ~10^12 M_sun within the cluster core.\nThe ICL makes up approximately half of the stellar luminosity and one-third of\nthe stellar mass of the central (NGC4874+ICL) system. The color distribution of\nthe IGC population is bimodal, with blue, metal-poor GCs outnumbering red,\nmetal-rich GCs by a ratio of 4:1.

Additional uncertainties arise due to the choices\nmade by analysts in determining Epeak (e.g., the start and stop times of\nintegration), imperfect knowledge of the response of the detector, different\nenergy ranges for various detectors, and differences in models used to fit the\nspectra. We examine the size of these individual sources of scatter by\ncomparing many independent pairs of published Epeak values for the same bursts.\nIndeed, the observed scatter in multiple reports of the same burst (often with\nthe same data) is greatly larger than the published statistical error bars. We\nmeasure that the one-sigma uncertainty associated with the analyst's choices is\n28%, i.e., 0.12 in Log10(Epeak), with the resultant errors always being\npresent.

However, several issues are yet to be clarified: SNe~Ia show\ncolor variations after the standardization. Also, individual SNe~Ia can show\nresiduals in their standardized peak absolute magnitude at the level of $\\sim\n0.15$ mag. In this paper, we explore how the color and luminosity residual are\nrelated to the wavelength shift of nebular emission lines observed at $\\gsim\n150$ days after maximum light. A sample of 11 SNe Ia which likely suffer from\nlittle host extinction indicates a correlation ($3.3\\sigma$) between the peak\n$B-V$ color and the late-time emission-line shift. Furthermore, a nearly\nidentical relation applies for a larger sample in which only three SNe with\n$B-V \\gsim 0.2$ mag are excluded. Following the interpretation that the\nlate-time emission-line shift is a tracer of the viewing direction from which\nan off-centre explosion is observed, we suggest that the viewing direction is a\ndominant factor controlling the SN color and that a large part of the color\nvariations is intrinsic, rather than due to the host extinction.

In this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novel\nnumerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum imparted\nto the ISM by radiation, supernovae, and stellar winds. We employ a realistic\ncooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to <100K, so\nthat the ISM becomes highly inhomogeneous. Despite this, our simulated galaxies\nreach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses to\nform giant molecular clouds (GMCs), dense clumps, and stars; subsequently,\nstellar feedback disperses the GMCs, repopulating the diffuse ISM. This\ncollapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of SMC-like dwarfs, the\nMilky-Way, and z~2 clumpy disk analogues. The simulated global star formation\nefficiencies are consistent with the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.\nMoreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numerically\nimposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold, and density\nscaling. This is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, star\nformation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very dense\ngas available for forming stars. In contrast, in simulations without stellar\nfeedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally-induced\nturbulence, the ISM experiences runaway collapse to very high densities. In\nthese simulations without feedback, the global star formation rates exceed\nobserved galactic star formation rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude,\ndemonstrating that stellar feedback is crucial to the regulation of star\nformation in galaxies. \n\n"}

At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly. Even when the magnetar survives, it\naccretes at least ~0.3 solar masses, so we expect magnetars born within these\ntypes of environments to be more massive than the 1.4 solar masses typically\nassociated with neutron stars. The propeller mechanism converts the ~10^{52}\nergs of spin energy in the magnetar into the kinetic energy of an outflow,\nwhich shock heats the outgoing supernova ejecta during the first ~10-30 s.

We propose a model for the\nUHECR contribution from the spin-down power of black holes (BHs) in LLAGN,\nwhich present a jet power $P_{\\mathrm{j}} \\leqslant 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This\nis in contrast to the opinion that only high-luminosity AGN can accelerate\nparticles to energies $ \\geqslant 50$ EeV. We rewrite the equations which\ndescribe the synchrotron self-absorbed emission of a non-thermal particle\ndistribution to obtain the observed radio flux density from flat-spectrum core\nsources and its relationship to the jet power. In general, the jet power\nprovides the UHECR luminosity and so, its relationship to the observed radio\nflux density. We found that the UHECR luminosity is dependent on the observed\nradio flux density, the distance to the AGN, and the BH mass, where the\nparticle acceleration regions can be sustained by the magnetic energy\nextraction from spinning BHs and where the strength of the magnetic field at\nthe sites of particle acceleration scales with the maximum value of the BH\nmagnetic field, which is $\\sim 10^4$ gauss for a BH of $10^9 M_{\\odot}$. We\napply the model to M87 and Cen A, two possible sources of UHECRs, whose jet\nparameters can be inferred from observational data. Next, we use a complete\nsample of 29 steep spectrum radio sources with a total flux density greater\nthan 0.5 Jy at 5 GHz to make predictions for the maximum particle energy,\nluminosity, and flux of the UHECRs from nearby AGN. Using our proposed model,\nit is possible to show that LLAGN can be sites of the origin of UHECRs. In\nadditional, the scenario in which the contribution to the UHECR flux from many\nweak radio galaxies would dominate over that from a few strong radio galaxies,\nor vice-versa, should be substantiated with further statistics. \n\n"}

At large separations, the tidal effect of the\nsecondary CO clears a gap.

The accretion disk leaves an imprint on the GW through its angular\nmomentum exchange with the binary, the mass increase of the binary members due\nto accretion, and its gravity. We compute the disk-modified GWs both in an\nanalytical Newtonian approximation and in a numerical effective-one-body\napproach. We find that disk-induced migration provides the dominant\nperturbation to the inspiral, with weaker effects from the mass accretion onto\nthe CO and hydrodynamic drag.

Abstract: Before it becomes a sensitive probe of the Epoch of Reionization, the Dark\nAges, and fundamental physics, 21 cm tomography must successfully contend with\nthe issue of foreground contamination. Broadband foreground sources are\nexpected to be roughly four orders of magnitude larger than any cosmological\nsignals, so precise foreground models will be necessary. Such foreground models\noften contain a large number of parameters, reflecting the complicated physics\nthat governs foreground sources. In this paper, we concentrate on spectral\nmodeling (neglecting, for instance, bright point source removal from spatial\nmaps) and show that 21 cm tomography experiments will likely not be able to\nmeasure these parameters without large degeneracies, simply because the\nforeground spectra are so featureless and generic. However, we show that this\nis also an advantage, because it means that the foregrounds can be\ncharacterized to a high degree of accuracy once a small number of parameters\n(likely three or four, depending on one's instrumental specifications) are\nmeasured. This provides a simple understanding for why 21 cm foreground\nsubtraction schemes are able to remove most of the contaminants by suppressing\njust a small handful of simple spectral forms. In addition, this suggests that\nthe foreground modeling process should be relatively simple and will likely not\nbe an impediment to the foreground subtraction schemes that are necessary for a\nsuccessful 21 cm tomography experiment. \n\n"}

We construct a\nthree-dimensionally axisymmetric mass distribution with 3 components: an\nexponential profile for the disk, a point mass for the bulge, and an NFW\nprofile for the halo. The mass model is simultaneously fitted to the kinematics\nand the lensing data. The NFW halo needs to be oblate with a flattening of\na/c=0.33^{+0.07}_{-0.05} to be consistent with the radio data. This suggests\nthat baryons are effective at making the halos oblate near the center.

Blazars are radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a jet\npointing at small angles towards the observer. The overall emitted spectrum is\ntypically non-thermal, and in some cases the emission and/or absorption lines\nare so faint as to prevent the determination of the redshift based on optical\nspectroscopy methods. PKS 0447-439 is a bright blazar recently detected at very\nhigh energy. The redshift of the source is still disputed: a recent spectral\nanalysis reports only a lower limit of z > 1.246, which contradicts the\nprevious measure of z = 0.205 reported in the literature. Aims. We aim to give\na redshift estimate of the blazar PKS 0447-439 based on combined GeV\n(Fermi/LAT) and TeV (H.E.S.S.) observations. Methods. Taking into account the\nabsorption of TeV photons by the interaction with the extragalactic background\nlight (EBL), we applied the method we developed in a previous work to derive\nthe redshift of PKS 0447-439. Moreover, we compiled the overall spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) using optical-UV, soft X-ray, and -ray data, nearly\nsimultaneous to the H.E.S.S. observations at TeV energies. Finally we modelled\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED) within the framework of a homogeneous,\nleptonic synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. Results. Using the recent TeV\nspectrum measured by H.E.S.S. we obtain for PKS 0447-439 a redshift of zrec =\n0.20 \\pm 0.05, which is our estimate on the source distance. This value agrees\nvery well with the value reported in the literature and confirms that our\nmethod can be successfully used to constrain blazars distances.

Our primary results include: (1) Star\nforming galaxies generically self-regulate at Toomre Q~1. Most of the volume is\nin diffuse hot gas with most of the mass in dense GMC complexes. The phase\nstructure and gas mass at high densities are much more sensitive probes of\nstellar feedback physics than integrated quantities (Toomre Q or gas velocity\ndispersion).

SNe and stellar winds dominate the dynamics of volume-filling hot gas;\nhowever this primarily vents out of the disk. (3) The galaxy-averaged SFR is\ndetermined by feedback. For given feedback efficiency, restricting star\nformation to molecular gas or modifying the cooling function has little effect;\nbut changing feedback mechanisms directly translates to shifts off the\nKennicutt-Schmidt relation.

Supersonic\nturbulence drives the density distribution to a lognormal with dispersion\nincreasing with Mach number; we generalize this to include scales >h (the disk\nscale height), and use it to construct the statistical properties of the\ndensity field smoothed on a scale R.

This agrees remarkably well with observed GMC mass\nfunctions in the MW and other galaxies; the only inputs are the mass and size\nof the galaxies (to normalize the model). This explains the mass function\ncutoff and its power-law slope (close to, but shallower than, -2).

Theory suggests that rotating Wolf-Rayet stars are the best\ncandidates, but their strong stellar winds shroud their surfaces, preventing a\ndirect measurement of their rotation. Fortunately, linear spectropolarimetry\nmay be used to probe the flattening of their winds due to stellar spin.\nSpectropolarimetry surveys show that an 80% majority of WR stars have\nspherically symmetric winds and are thus rotating slowly, yet a small 20%\nminority display a spectropolarimetric signature indicative of rotation. Here\nwe find a highly significant correlation between WR objects that carry the\nsignature of stellar rotation and the subset of WR stars with ejecta nebulae\nthat have only recently transitioned from a red sugergiant or luminous blue\nvariable phase. As these youthful WR stars have yet to spin-down due to mass\nloss, they are the best candidate GRB progenitors identified to date.

Taking advantage of the fact\nthat in nearby dwarfs photometry of individual stars is available we introduce\ndiscrete measures of shape based on the two-dimensional inertia tensor and the\nFourier bar mode. We apply these measures of shape first to a variety of\nsimulated dwarf galaxies formed via tidal stirring of disks embedded in dark\nmatter halos and orbiting the Milky Way.

The HST/WFPC2\ncolor-magnitude diagram (CMD) of Leo T is exquisitely deep, extending ~ 2\nmagnitudes below the oldest main sequence turnoff, permitting excellent\nconstraints on star formation at all ages.

The resulting SFHs are\nremarkably consistent at all ages, indicating that our derived SFH is robust to\nthe choice of stellar evolution model. From the lifetime SFH of Leo T, we find\nthat 50% of the total stellar mass formed prior to z ~ 1 (7.6 Gyr ago).\nSubsequent to this epoch, the SFH of Leo T is roughly constant until the most\nrecent ~ 25 Myr, where the SFH shows an abrupt drop.

An Analytic Model for Stellar Correlation\n  Functions Abstract: Recently, we have shown that if the ISM is governed by super-sonic turbulent\nflows, the excursion-set formalism can be used to calculate the statistics of\nself-gravitating objects over a wide range of scales. On the largest\nself-gravitating scales ('first crossing'), these correspond to GMCs, and on\nthe smallest non-fragmenting self-gravitating scales ('last crossing'), to\nprotostellar cores. Here, we extend this formalism to rigorously calculate the\nauto and cross-correlation functions of cores (and by extension, young stars)\nas a function of spatial separation and mass, in analogy to the cosmological\ncalculation of halo clustering. We show that this generically predicts that\nstar formation is very strongly clustered on small scales: stars form in\nclusters, themselves inside GMCs. Outside the binary-star regime, the projected\ncorrelation function declines as a weak power-law, until a characteristic scale\nwhich corresponds to the characteristic mass scale of GMCs. On much larger\nscales the clustering declines such that star formation is not strongly biased\non galactic scales, relative to the actual dense gas distribution. The precise\ncorrelation function shape depends on properties of the turbulent spectrum, but\nits qualitative behavior is quite general. The predictions agree well with\nobservations of young star and core autocorrelation functions over ~4 dex in\nradius. Clustered star formation is a generic consequence of supersonic\nturbulence if most of the power in the velocity field, hence the contribution\nto density fluctuations, comes from large scales. The distribution of\nself-gravitating masses near the sonic length is then imprinted by fluctuations\non larger scales. We similarly show that the fraction of stars formed in\n'isolated' modes should be small (\\lesssim10%). \n\n"}

While a strong interaction\nbetween SN ejecta and dense circumstellar media (CSM) is a leading scenario,\nalternative models have been proposed. In this Letter, we suggest new\ndiagnostics to discriminate the strong SN-CSM interaction scenario from the\nothers: a decline in the luminosity ('dip') before the main peak of the light\ncurve. This dip is an unavoidable consequence of having a dense CSM within\nwhich the shock breakout occurs. If a dense CSM shell is located far at large\nradii from the progenitor inside, it takes time for the SN ejecta to reach it\nand the early light curve can be powered by the SN ejecta before the collision.\nOnce the SN ejecta collides with the dense CSM, the electron density and thus\nthe Thomson scattering opacity suddenly increase. Photons become unable to go\nout of the shock even if there is a source of emission inside, which results in\nthe dip in the light curve. This dip is a solid prediction from the strong\ninteraction scenario irrespective of a power source for the early emission.\nEventually the forward shock breaks out from within the dense CSM, and the\nluminosity increases by the continuous strong SN-CSM interaction, resulting in\nan SLSN.

Spectra of SN2011hw are unusual compared to normal SN\ntypes, most closely resembling the spectra of SNeIbn. We center our analysis on\ncomparing SN 2011hw to the well-studied TypeIbn SN2006jc. While the two SNe\nhave many important similarities, the differences are quite telling: compared\nto SN2006jc, SN2011hw has weaker HeI and CaII lines and relatively stronger H\nlines, its light curve has a higher luminosity and slower decline rate, and\nemission lines associated with the progenitor's CSM are narrower. One can\nreproduce the unusual continuum shape of SN2011hw with equal contributions of a\n6000K blackbody and a spectrum of SN2006jc. We attribute this emission\ncomponent and many other differences between the two SNe to extra opacity from\na small amount of additional H in SN2011hw, analogous to the small H mass that\nmakes SNeIIb differ from SNeIb. Slower speeds in the CSM and elevated H content\nsuggest a connection between the progenitor of SN2011hw and the class of\nOfpe/WN9 stars, which have been associated with LBVs in their hot quiescent\nphases between outbursts, and are H-poor - but not H-free like classical\nWolf-Rayet (WR) stars.

The optical\nspectrum exhibits broad emission features of [O I], [O II], [O III], H-alpha,\nH-beta, and [Fe II]. The last decade of evolution has exhibited a strengthening\nof the oxygen transitions, evidence that the late-time emission is powered by\nincreasingly metal-rich SN ejecta crossing the reverse shock. The H-alpha\nluminosity requires that SN 1998S is still interacting with dense circumstellar\nmaterial (CSM), probably produced by the strong wind of a red supergiant\nprogenitor at least ~1000 years before explosion. The emission lines exhibit\nasymmetric blueshifted profiles, which implies that the receding hemisphere of\nthe SN is obscured by dust. The [O III] line, in particular, exhibits a\ncomplete suppression of its red wing. This could be the result of the expected\nwavelength dependence for dust extinction or a smaller radial distribution for\n[O III]. In the latter case, the red wing of [O III] could be absorbed by core\ndust, while both the blue and red wings are absorbed by dust within the cool\ndense shell between the forward and reverse shocks; this interpretation could\nexplain why late-time [O III] emission from SNe is often weaker than models\npredict.

By comparing synthetic line profiles\nwith HST/STIS spectra obtained near apastron, we show that the WWC cavity has a\nstrong influence on multi-wavelength diagnostics. This influence is regulated\nby the modification of the optical depth in the continuum and spectral lines.\nWe find that H-alpha, H-beta, and Fe II lines are the most affected by the WWC\ncavity, since they form over a large volume of the primary wind. These spectral\nlines depend on latitude and azimuth since, according to the orientation of the\ncavity, different velocity regions of a spectral line are affected. For 2D\nmodels with orientation corresponding to orbital inclination angle 110deg < i <\n140deg and longitude of periastron 210deg < omega < 330deg, the blueshifted and\nzero-velocity regions of the line profiles are the most affected. These orbital\norientations are required to simultaneously fit the UV and optical spectrum of\nEta Car, for a half-opening angle of the cavity in the range 50-70deg. We find\nthat the excess P-Cygni absorption seen in H-alpha, H-beta and optical Fe II\nlines in spherical models becomes much weaker or absent in the 2D models, in\nagreement with the observations. The observed UV spectrum of Eta Car, dominated\nby Fe II absorption lines, is superbly reproduced by our 2D cavity models.\nSmall discrepancies still remain, as H-gamma and H-delta absorptions are\noverestimated by our models.

The reason is that stellar winds have\nbeen found to be clumped, which results in the reduction of unclumped empirical\nmass-loss rates. Most stellar evolution models employ theoretical mass-loss\nrates which are already reduced by a moderate factor of ~2-3 compared to\nnon-corrected empirical rates. A key question is whether these reduced rates\nare of the correct order of magnitude, or if they should be reduced even\nfurther, which would mean that the alternative of eruptive mass loss becomes\nnecessary. Here we introduce the transition mass-loss rate (dM/dt)_trans\nbetween O and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Its novelty is that it is model\nindependent. All that is required is postulating the spectroscopic transition\npoint in a given data-set, and determining the stellar luminosity, which is far\nless model dependent than the mass-loss rate. The transition mass-loss rate is\nsubsequently used to calibrate stellar wind strength by its application to the\nOf/WNh stars in the Arches cluster. Good agreement is found with two\nalternative modelling/theoretical results, suggesting that the rates provided\nby current theoretical models are of the right order of magnitude in the\n~50Msun mass range. Our results do not confirm the specific need for eruptive\nmass loss as Luminous Blue Variables, and current stellar evolution modelling\nfor Galactic massive stars seems sound. Mass loss through alternative\nmechanisms might still become necessary at lower masses, and/or metallicities,\nand the quantification of alternative mass loss is desirable. \n\n"}

For the\nlarge majority of stars with masses 0.7 < M/M_sun < 0.9 and heavy-element mass\nfractions 0.001 < Z < 0.006, the Li abundance is well fitted by a relation\nA(Li) = a0 + a1 M + a2 Z + a3 M Z, where a0, a1, a2, and a3 are constants.\nExtrapolating this relation to Z = 0 leads to a Li abundance close to the\nprimordial value predicted from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis calculations\nand the WMAP baryon density. The relation, however, does not apply to stars\nwith [Fe/H] < -1.5. We suggest that metal-rich halo stars were formed with a Li\nabundance close to the primordial value, and that lithium in their atmospheres\nhas been depleted in time with an approximately linear dependence on stellar\nmass and Z.

The scalar field\npotential is the recently found to be compatible with the hairy generalization\nof the Plebanski-Demianski solution of general relativity. This paper describes\nthe spherically symmetric solutions that smoothly connect the Schwarzschild\nblack hole with its hairy counterpart. The geometry and scalar field are\neverywhere regular except at the usual Schwarzschild like singularity inside\nthe black hole. The scalar field energy momentum tensor satisfies the null\nenergy condition in the static region of the spacetime. The first law holds\nwhen the parameters of the scalar field potential are fixed under\nthermodynamical variation. Secondly, it is shown that an extra, dimensionless\nparameter, present in the hairy solution, allows to modify the gravitational\nfield of a spherically symmetric black hole in a remarkable way. When the\ndimensionless parameter is increased, the scalar field generates a flat\ngravitational potential, that however asymptotically matches the Schwarzschild\ngravitational field.

The final starburst is\ndominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due to\nglobal torques. The resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.\nThe gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 M_sun) GMCs and\nsubsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 M_sun). However, in contrast\nto some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form the\ncentral bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center of\nthe galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses GMCs after they turn several\npercent of their mass into stars. Most of the mass that reaches the nucleus\ndoes so in the form of gas. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law emerges naturally as a\nconsequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of the\nsmall-scale star formation microphysics. The same mechanisms that drive this\nrelation in isolated galaxies, in particular radiation pressure from IR\nphotons, extend over seven decades in SFR to regulate star formation in the\nmost extreme starbursts (densities >10^4 M_sun/pc^2).

Aims. For 14 UCXBs\nincluding two candidates, we investigate the long-term variability and average\nluminosity with the purpose of learning how often a source can be expected to\nbe visible above a given luminosity, and we compare the derived luminosities\nwith the theoretical predictions. Methods. We use data from the RXTE All-Sky\nMonitor because of its long-term, unbiased observations. Many UCXBs are faint,\ni.e., they have a count rate at the noise level for most of the time. Still,\ninformation can be extracted from the data, either by using only reliable data\npoints or by combining the bright-end variability behavior with the\ntime-averaged luminosity. Results. Luminosity probability distributions show\nthe fraction of time that a source emits above a given luminosity. All UCXBs\nshow significant variability and relatively similar behavior, though the\ntime-averaged luminosity implies higher variability in systems with a period\nlonger than 40 min. Conclusions. There is no large difference in the\nstatistical luminosity behavior of what we usually call persistent and\ntransient sources.

A Salpeter stellar initial mass function in the\n  bulges of massive spiral galaxies Abstract: Recent work has suggested that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is not\nuniversal, but rather is correlated with galaxy stellar mass, stellar velocity\ndispersion, or morphological type. In this paper, we investigate variations of\nthe IMF within individual galaxies. For this purpose, we use strong lensing and\ngas kinematics to measure independently the normalisation of the IMF of the\nbulge and disk components of a sample of 5 massive spiral galaxies with\nsubstantial bulge components taken from the SWELLS survey. We find that the\nstellar mass of the bulges are tightly constrained by the lensing and kinematic\ndata. A comparison with masses based on stellar population synthesis models\nfitted to optical and near infrared photometry favors a Salpeter-like\nnormalisation of the IMF. Conversely, the disk masses are less well constrained\ndue to degeneracies with the dark matter halo, but are consistent with Milky\nWay type IMFs in agreement with previous studies. The disks are submaximal at\n2.2 disk scale lengths, but due to the contribution of the bulges, the galaxies\nare baryon dominated at 2.2 disk scale lengths. Globally, our inferred IMF\nnormalisation is consistent with that found for early-type galaxies of\ncomparable stellar mass (> 10^11 M_sun).

Abstract: The fraction of compact active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that exhibit\ninterstellar scintillation (ISS) at radio wavelengths, as well as their\nscintillation amplitudes, have been found to decrease significantly for sources\nat redshifts z > 2. This can be attributed to an increase in the angular sizes\nof the \\muas-scale cores or a decrease in the flux densities of the compact\n\\muas cores relative to that of the mas-scale components with increasing\nredshift, possibly arising from (1) the space-time curvature of an expanding\nUniverse, (2) AGN evolution, (3) source selection biases, (4) scatter\nbroadening in the ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) and intervening galaxies,\nor (5) gravitational lensing. We examine the frequency scaling of this redshift\ndependence of ISS to determine its origin, using data from a dual-frequency\nsurvey of ISS of 128 sources at 0 < z < 4. We present a novel method of\nanalysis which accounts for selection effects in the source sample. We\ndetermine that the redshift dependence of ISS is partially linked to the\nsteepening of source spectral indices ({\\alpha}^8.4_4.9) with redshift, caused\neither by selection biases or AGN evolution, coupled with weaker ISS in the\n{\\alpha}^8.4_4.9 < -0.4 sources.

One important question is\nwhether the chemical abundances in this star reflect the chemical composition\nof the gas cloud from which it was formed or if they have been severely\naffected by other processes, such as dust-gas winnowing. Aims: We measure or\nprovide an upper limit to the abundance of the volatile element sulphur, which\ncan help to discriminate between the two scenarios. Methods: We observed HE\n1327-2326 with the high resolution infra-red spectrograph CRIRES at the VLT to\nobserve the S I lines of Multiplet 3 at 1045 nm. Results: We do not detect the\nS I line.

Here we show that initial\nconditions that break this symmetry (i.e., {\\it tilted} poloidal magnetic\nfields in the NS) generate much stronger poloidal fields in the disk,\nindicating that asymmetric initial conditions may be necessary for establishing\nBHNS mergers as SGRB progenitors via fully general relativistic MHD\nsimulations. We demonstrate that BHNS mergers may form an SGRB engine under the\nright conditions by seeding the remnant disk from an unmagnetized BHNS\nsimulation with purely poloidal fields dynamically unimportant initially, but\nstrong enough to resolve MRI. Magnetic turbulence occurs in the disk, driving\naccretion and supporting Poynting-dominated jet outflows sufficient to power an\nSGRB. \n\n"}

Building a\ncoherent picture of how star clusters form and evolve is therefore critical to\nour overall understanding of the star formation process.

Specifically, setting the column density\nthreshold near or above the peak of the column density probability distribution\nfunction Npdf ($N\\sim 10^{21}$ cm\\alamenos 2) produces the Larson scaling as\nlong as the Npdf decreases rapidly at higher column densities.

One such case was SN 2009ip, which was recognized to\nbe a luminous blue variable (LBV) eruption. This source had a massive hot\nprogenitor star identified in pre-explosion data, it had documented evidence of\npre-outburst variability, and it was subsequently discovered to have a 2nd\noutburst in 2010. This same source rebrightened again in 2012, and early\nspectra showed the same narrow-line profiles as before, suggesting another\nLBV-like eruption. We present new photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2009ip,\nindicating that it has transitioned into a true SN. The most striking discovery\nin these data is that unlike previous reports, the spectrum exhibited Balmer\nlines with very broad P-Cygni profiles characteristic of normal Type II\nsupernovae (SNe II), in addition to narrow emission lines seen in SNe IIn and\nLBVs. Emission components have FWHM 8000 km/s, while the P-Cygni absorption\ncomponent has blue wings extending to -13,000 km/s. These velocities are\ntypical of SNe II, but have never been associated with emission lines from a\nnonterminal LBV-like eruption. Initially, the peak absolute magnitude seemed\nfainter than that of normal SNe. However, after a brief period of fading, the\nsource quickly brightened again to M_R=-17.5 mag over a couple days. The broad\nlines mostly disappeared, and the spectrum began to resemble the early\noptically thick phases of SNe IIn. Two weeks later the source leveled off near\n-18 mag, after which broad emission lines again developed in the spectrum as\nthe source faded. We conclude that the 2012 outburst of SN 2009ip was the\nresult of a true core-collapse SN IIn that occured when the progenitor star was\nin an LBV-like outburst phase, and where the SN was initially faint and then\nrapidly brightened due to interaction with circumstellar material (abridged). \n\n"}

Quintessence and\n  K-Essence Abstract: Many cosmological models invoke rolling scalar fields to account for the\nobserved acceleration of the expansion of the universe. These theories\ngenerally include a potential V(phi) which is a function of the scalar field\nphi. Although V(phi) can be represented by a very diverse set of functions,\nrecent work has shown the under some conditions, such as the slow roll\nconditions, the equation of state parameter w is either independent of the form\nof V(phi) or is part of family of solutions with only a few parameters. In\nrealistic models of this type the scalar field couples to other sectors of the\nmodel leading to possibly observable changes in the fundamental constants such\nas the fine structure constant alpha and the proton to electron mass ratio mu.\nThis paper explores the limits this puts on the validity of various cosmologies\nthat invoke rolling scalar fields. We find that the limit on the variation of\nmu puts significant constraints on the product of a cosmological parameter w+1\ntimes a new physics parameter zeta_mu^2, the coupling constant between mu and\nthe rolling scalar field. Even when the cosmologies are restricted to very slow\nroll conditions either the value of zeta_mu must be at the lower end of or less\nthan its expected values or the value of w+1 must be restricted to values\nvanishingly close to 0. This implies that either the rolling scalar field is\nvery weakly coupled with the electromagnetic field, small zeta_mu, very weakly\ncoupled with gravity, w+1 ~ 0 or both. These results stress that adherence to\nthe measured invariance in mu is a very significant test of the validity of any\nproposed cosmology and any new physics it requires. The limits on the variation\nof mu also produces a significant tension with the reported changes in the\nvalue of alpha. \n\n"}

Overall, we find that the outflows expel\nmetal-enriched gas away from galaxies, significantly quench star formation, and\nenrich the CGM. At z = 2, the radial profiles of gas properties around galaxy\ncenters are most sensitive to the choice of the wind model for halo masses\n(10^9 - 10^11) M_sun. We infer that the RVWb model is similar to the NW case,\nexcept that it substantially enriches the CGM: the carbon metallicity (Z_C) is\n10 times higher in RVWb than in NW at r > R_200; and the warm gas of 10^4 -\n10^5 K and delta < 100 is enriched to 50 times higher than in NW.

RVWa causes a greater suppression of star formation rate at z < 5,\nand has a higher fraction of low-density (delta < 10), warm-hot (10^4 - 10^6 K)\ngas than in CW.

We provide a redshift-parameterised fit for the SO\nmass function valid for the entire redshift range to within ~20% as well as a\nscheme to calculate the mass function for haloes with arbitrary overdensities.\nThe FOF mass function displays a weaker evolution with redshift. We provide a\n`universal' fit for the FOF mass function, fitted to data across the entire\nredshift range simultaneously, and observe redshift evolution in our data\nversus this fit. The relative evolution of the mass functions derived via the\ntwo methods is compared and we find that the mass functions most closely match\nat z=0. The disparity at z=0 between the FOF and SO mass functions resides in\ntheir high mass tails where the collapsed fraction of mass in SO haloes is ~80%\nof that in FOF haloes. This difference grows with redshift so that, by z>20,\nthe SO algorithm finds a ~50-80% lower collapsed fraction in high mass haloes\nthan does the FOF algorithm, due in part to the significant over-linking\neffects known to affect the FOF method. \n\n"}

We show that the\nlinear matter power spectra for the three models are all characterised by the\ncomoving Jeans scale at the matter-radiation equality. Furthermore, we can also\ndescribe the linear matter power spectrum for the Long-Lived CHAMP model in\nterms of a suitably defined characteristic cut-off scale k_{Ch}, similarly to\nthe WDM models.

We suggest that the quasi-periodicity feature of\ntiming noise, with rapid oscillations lying on lower frequency structure, comes\nfrom the geodetic precession of an unseen binary system, which induces\nadditional motion of the pulsar spin axis. The resultant change of azimuth and\nlatitude at which the observer's line of sight crosses the emission beam is\nresponsible for the variation of timing noise and pulse profile respectively.\nThe first numerical simulation to both timing noise and pulse profile variation\nare thus performed, from which the orbital periods of these pulsars are of 1-35\nminutes. Considering the existence of the ultracompact binary white dwarf of\norbital period of 5.4 minute, HM Cancri, such orbital periods to pulsar\nbinaries are not strange.

Type Ib and Ic supernovae Abstract: Integral field spectroscopy of 11 type-Ib/c supernova explosion sites in\nnearby galaxies has been obtained using UH88/SNIFS and Gemini-N/GMOS. The use\nof integral field spectroscopy enables us to obtain both spatial and spectral\ninformation of the explosion site, allowing the identification of the parent\nstellar population of the supernova progenitor star. The spectrum of the parent\npopulation provides metallicity determination via strong-line method and age\nestimation obtained via comparison with simple stellar population (SSP) models.\nWe adopt this information as the metallicity and age of the supernova\nprogenitor, under the assumption that it was coeval with the parent stellar\npopulation. The age of the star corresponds to its lifetime, which in turn\ngives the estimate of its initial mass. With this method we were able to\ndetermine both the metallicity and initial (ZAMS) mass of the progenitor stars\nof the type Ib and Ic supernovae. We found that on average SN Ic explosion\nsites are more metal-rich and younger than SN Ib sites. The initial mass of the\nprogenitors derived from parent stellar population age suggests that SN Ic have\nmore massive progenitors than SN Ib. In addition, we also found indication that\nsome of our SN progenitors are less massive than ~25 Msun, indicating that they\nmay have been stars in a close binary system that have lost their outer\nenvelope via binary interactions to produce Ib/c supernovae, instead of single\nWolf-Rayet stars. These findings support the current suggestions that both\nbinary and single progenitor channels are in effect in producing type Ib/c\nsupernovae.

The progenitor likely has a\nluminosity of log (L/Lsun)~5.55, surface temperature ~45000 K, and mass of\n~10.9 Msun at the time of explosion. Our non-rotating 32 Msun model\noverestimates the derived radius of the progenitor, although this could likely\nbe reconciled with a fine-tuned model of a more massive (between 40 and 50\nMsun), hotter, and luminous progenitor.

These surveys necessitate the determination of the galaxy\nredshifts using photometric techniques (photo-z). Oftentimes, it is\nadvantageous to remove from the galaxy sample those for which one suspects that\nthe photo-z estimation might be unreliable. In this paper, we show that\napplying these photo-z quality cuts blindly can grossly bias the measured\ngalaxy correlations within and across photometric redshift bins. We then extend\nthe work of Ho et al. (2012) and Ross et al. (2011) to develop a simple and\neffective method to correct for this using the data themselves. Finally, we\napply the method to the Mega-Z catalog, containing about a million luminous red\ngalaxies in the redshift range 0.45 < z < 0.65. After splitting the sample into\nfour \\Delta z = 0.05 photo-z bins using the BPZ algorithm, we see how our\ncorrections bring the measured galaxy auto- and cross-correlations into\nagreement with expectations. We then look for the BAO feature in the four bins,\nwith and without applying the photo-z quality cuts, and find a broad agreement\nbetween the BAO scales extracted in both cases. Intriguingly, we observe a\ncorrelation between galaxy density and photo-z quality even before any photo-z\nquality cuts are applied. This may be due to uncorrected observational effects\nthat result in correlated gradients across the sky of the galaxy density and\nthe galaxy photo-z precision. Our correction procedure could also help to\nmitigate some of these systematic effects. \n\n"}

The mass loss of the star clusters is continuous\nirrespective of the tidal history of the host halo, but major merger events\ntend to increase the rate of mass loss. From the selected two dark matter\nhaloes, the halo that experienced the larger number of mergers tends to drive a\nsmaller mass loss rate from the embedded star clusters, even though the final\nmasses of both haloes are similar.

Our simulations include fully explicit treatment of both the\nmulti-phase ISM (molecular through hot) and stellar feedback. The stellar\nfeedback inputs (energy, momentum, mass, and metal fluxes) are taken directly\nfrom stellar population models. These sources of stellar feedback, with zero\nadjusted parameters, reproduce the observed relation between stellar and halo\nmass up to M_halo~10^12 M_sun (including dwarfs, satellites, MW-mass disks, and\nsmall groups). By extension, this leads to reasonable agreement with the\nstellar mass function for M_star<10^11 M_sun. We predict weak redshift\nevolution in the M_star-M_halo relation, consistent with current constraints to\nz>6. We find that the M_star-M_halo relation is insensitive to numerical\ndetails, but is sensitive to the feedback physics. Simulations with only\nsupernova feedback fail to reproduce the observed stellar masses, particularly\nin dwarf and high-redshift galaxies: radiative feedback (photo-heating and\nradiation pressure) is necessary to disrupt GMCs and enable efficient coupling\nof later supernovae to the gas.

However,\nbecause density fluctuations depend super-exponentially on tau_stop (inversely\nproportional to disk surface density), lower-density disks are more unstable.\nIn fact, we predict that cm-sized grains at ~1au will form pebble piles in a\ndisk with ~10% the MMSN density, so planet formation at ~au may generically\noccur late, as disks are evaporating. We also predict that conditions become\nprogressively more favorable for pebble-pile formation around lower-mass,\ncooler stars. \n\n"}

Examining the residuals\nof fits of pulses to such models suggests the following patterns of departure\nfrom smooth pulses: three separate wavelike peaks found in the residuals of\neach pulse (the precursor peak, the central peak, and the decay peak) combine\nwith the underlying Norris et al. (2005) pulse model to produce five distinct\nregions in the temporal evolution of each pulse. The Precursor Shelf occurs\nprior to or concurrent with the exponential Rapid Rise. The pulse reaches\nmaximum intensity at the Peak Plateau, then undergoes a Rapid Decay. The decay\ngradually slows into an Extended Tail. Despite these distinct temporal\nsegments, the pulses studied are almost universally characterized by hard to\nsoft spectral evolution, arguing that the new pulse features reflect a single\nevolution, rather than being artifacts of pulse overlap. The fluctuations can\ngive a single pulse the appearance of having up to three distinct localized\npeaks, leading to ambiguities in pulse-fitting if an incorrect pulse model is\nused. The approach demonstrates that complex GRBs may be composed of fewer\npulses than indicated by the number of peaks. The large degree of similar\nspectro-temporal behavior within gamma-ray burst pulses indicates that a single\nprocess is responsible for producing pulses spanning a tremendous range of\ndurations, luminosities, and spectral hardnesses, and the correlated\ncharacteristics of the wavelike peaks are related to the pulse asymmetry,\nsuggesting kinematic origins that seem supportive of relativistic shocks. \n\n"}

In the $n$-dimensional\nsetting, however, it requires the inversion of an $n \\times n$ covariance\nmatrix, $C$, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, $\\det(C)$. In many\ncases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of\nthe form $C = \\sigma^2 I + K$, where $K$ is computed using a specified\ncovariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters\n(hyperparameters). The matrix $C$ is typically dense, causing standard direct\nmethods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require $\\mathcal O(n^3)$\nwork. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling.

This\nproblem has drawn renewed interest due to recent determinations of gas mass\nfractions beyond R200, which appear to be considerably larger than the cosmic\nmean, and because the clusters' total Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux receives a\nsignificant contribution from these regions. Here, we use a large suite of\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the clumpiness of density and\npressure and employ different variants of simulated physics, including\nradiative gas physics and thermal feedback by active galactic nuclei. We find\nthat density and pressure clumping closely trace each other as a function of\nradius, but the bias on density remains on average < 20% within the virial\nradius R200. At larger radius, clumping increases steeply due to the continuous\ninfall of coherent structures that have not yet passed the accretion shock.\nDensity and pressure clumping increase with cluster mass and redshift, which\nprobes on average dynamically younger objects that are still in the process of\nassembling.

If the source of the viscosity is powered by\naccretion, such as in the case of the magneto-rotational instability, such\ndistant energy sources must lie in the innermost regions of the disk, where\naccretion occurs even at the midplane. We argue here that modulations in this\nenergy supply can alter the accretion rate on dynamical, rather than far longer\nviscous, time scales.

We show that the presence of magnetic fields generated via the\nsmall-scale dynamo stabilises the protostellar disc and provides some degree of\nsupport against fragmentation. In the absence of magnetic fields, the\nfragmentation timescale in our model decreases by a factor of ~10 at the\ntransition from Z=0 to Z>0, with subsequently only a weak dependence on\nmetallicity. Similarly, the accretion timescale of the cluster is set by the\nlarge-scale dynamics rather than the local thermodynamics. In the presence of\nmagnetic fields, the primordial disc can become completely stable, therefore\nforming only one central fragment. At Z>0, the number of fragments is somewhat\nreduced in the presence of magnetic fields, though the shape of the mass\nspectrum is not strongly affected in the limits of the statistical\nuncertainties.

The precise nature\nof the progenitor, however, remains debated owing to spectral ambiguities\narising from a strong contribution from the CSM interaction. Late-time spectra\noffer potential insight if the post-shock cold, dense shell becomes\nsufficiently thin and/or the ejecta begin to cross the reverse shock. To date,\nfew high-quality spectra of this kind exist. Here we report on the late-time\noptical and infrared spectra of the SNe~Ia-CSM 2012ca and 2013dn. These SNe\nIa-CSM spectra exhibit low [Fe III]/[Fe II] ratios and strong [Ca II] at late\nepochs. Such characteristics are reminiscent of the super-Chandrasekhar-mass\n(SC) candidate SN 2009dc, for which these features suggested a low-ionisation\nstate due to high densities, although the broad Fe features admittedly show\nsimilarities to the blue \"quasi-continuum\" observed in some core-collapse SNe\nIbn and IIn.

The time of quenching varies from ~2 Gyr before\naccretion (first crossing of r200,c) to >4 Gyr after, depending on satellite\nand host mass. Once begun, quenching is rapid (>~ 500 Myr) in low-mass galaxies\n(M* < 10^10 M_Sun), but significantly more protracted for more massive\nsatellites. The simulations predict a substantial role of outflows driven by\nram pressure -- but not tidal forces -- in removing the star-forming\ninterstellar matter (ISM) from satellite galaxies, especially dwarfs (M* ~ 10^9\nM_Sun) where they account for nearly two thirds of ISM loss in both groups and\nclusters.

The method was applied to observed near-infrared\n(NIR) SN Ia samples; meaningful upper limits on the CS dust mass were derived\neven under conservative assumptions.

The general\nspectral evolution is also presented. Velocities measured from Fe II are\nsimilar for SLSNe and SNe Ibc, suggesting that diffusion time differences are\ndominated by mass or opacity. Flat velocity evolution in most SLSNe suggests a\ndense shell of ejecta. If opacities in SLSNe are similar to other SNe Ibc, the\naverage ejected mass is higher by a factor 2-3.

We present\nresults on the evolution of a misaligned gas disc in a cosmological simulation\nof a massive early-type galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environments\nproject. This galaxy experiences a merger which, together with a strong\ngalactic wind, removes most of the original gas disc. The galaxy subsequently\nreforms a gas disc through accretion of cold gas, but it is initially 120\ndegrees misaligned with the stellar rotation axis. This misalignment persists\nfor about 2 Gyr before the gas-star misalignment angle drops below 20 degrees.\nThe time it takes for the gaseous and stellar components to align is much\nlonger than previously thought, because the gas disc is accreting a significant\namount of mass for about 1.5 Gyr after the merger, during which the angular\nmomentum change induced by accreted gas dominates over that induced by stellar\ntorques. Once the gas accretion rate has decreased sufficiently, the gas disc\ndecouples from the surrounding halo gas and realigns with the stellar component\nin about 6 dynamical times.

The Wide Field Camera 3 yields near\ninfrared spectra of the cluster cores, covering the wavelength range\n0.81-1.69mum through grisms G102 and G141, while the Advanced Camera for\nSurveys in parallel mode provides G800L spectra of the infall regions of the\nclusters. The WFC3 spectra are taken at two almost orthogonal position angles\nin order to minimize the effects of confusion. After summarizing the scientific\ndrivers of GLASS, we describe the sample selection as well as the observing\nstrategy and data processing pipeline.

Specifically, we focus on the statistical measurement of the\n21 cm power spectrum (PS) from the epoch of reionization (EoR) using the low\nfrequency array, SKA1-low.

Physically, the large-scale\nmode that sources CMB lensing modulates the small-scale power and hence the\nintrinsic ellipticity, due to non-linear evolution. We find that the angular\ncross-correlation from tidal torquing has a very similar scale dependence as in\nthe linear alignment model, believed to be appropriate for elliptical galaxies.\nThe amplitude of the cross-correlation is predicted to depend strongly on the\nformation redshift, being smaller for galaxies that formed at higher redshift\nwhen the bispectrum of the gravitational potential was smaller.

Emission generated by this interaction provides a window\ninto the final stages of stellar evolution, by probing the history of mass loss\nfrom the progenitor. Here we use Chandra and Swift x-ray observations of the\ntype II-P/L SN 2013ej to probe the history of mass loss from its progenitor. We\nmodel the observed x-rays as emission from both heated circumstellar matter and\nsupernova ejecta.

Six months of radio observations of\nthe 2012 nova V5589 Sgr with the VLA and 15 weeks of X-ray observations with\nSwift/XRT show that the radio emission consisted of: 1) a shock-powered,\nnon-thermal flare; and 2) weak thermal emission from $10^{-5}$ M$_\\odot$ of\nfreely expanding, photoionized ejecta. Absorption features in the optical\nspectrum and the peak optical brightness suggest that V5589 Sgr lies 4 kpc away\n(3.2-4.6 kpc). The shock-powered flare dominated the radio light curve at low\nfrequencies before day 100. The spectral evolution of the radio flare, its high\nradio brightness temperature, the presence of unusually hard ($kT_x > 33$ keV)\nX-rays, and the ratio of radio to X-ray flux near radio maximum all support the\nconclusions that the flare was shock-powered and non-thermal. Unlike most other\nnovae with strong shock-powered radio emission, V5589 Sgr is not embedded in\nthe wind of a red-giant companion. Based on the similar inclinations and\noptical line profiles of V5589 Sgr and V959 Mon, we propose that shocks in\nV5589 Sgr formed from collisions between a slow flow with an equatorial density\nenhancement and a subsequent faster flow.

Naturally, neighbouring stream stars reach pericentre at\nslightly different times. In the presence of a rotating bar, these neighbouring\nstream stars experience different bar orientations during pericentric passage\nand hence each star receives a different torque from the bar. These differing\ntorques reshape the angular momentum and energy distribution of stars in the\nstream, which in turn changes the growth rate of the stream. For a progenitor\norbiting in the same sense as the bar's rotation and satisfying a resonance\ncondition, the resultant stream can be substantially shorter or longer than\nexpected, depending on whether the pericentric passages of the progenitor occur\nalong the bar's minor or major axis respectively. We present a full discussion\nof this phenomenon focusing mainly on streams confined to the Galactic plane.\nIn stark contrast with the evolution in static potentials, which give rise to\nstreams that grow steadily in time, rotating barred potentials can produce\ndynamically old, short streams. This challenges the traditional viewpoint that\nthe inner halo consists of well phase-mixed material whilst the\ntidally-disrupted structures in the outer halo are more spatially coherent.

We explore the alternative\nscenario of massive overcontact binary (MOB) evolution, which involves two very\nmassive stars in a very tight binary which remain fully mixed due to their\ntidally induced high spin. We use the public stellar-evolution code MESA to\nsystematically study this channel by means of detailed simulations. We find\nthat, at low metallicity, MOBs produce double-black-hole (BH+BH) systems that\nwill merge within a Hubble time with mass ratios close to one, in two mass\nranges, ~25...60msun and >~ 130msun, with pair instability supernovae (PISNe)\nbeing produced in-between.

Repeated observations through\n2016 have not detected radio pulsations again. The torque on the neutron star,\nas inferred from its rotation frequency derivative f-dot, decreased in an\nunsteady manner by a factor of 3 in the first year of radio monitoring. In\ncontrast, during its final year as a detectable radio source, the torque\ndecreased steadily by only 9%. The period-averaged flux density, after\ndecreasing by a factor of 20 during the first 10 months of radio monitoring,\nremained steady in the next 22 months, at an average of 0.7+/-0.3 mJy at 1.4\nGHz, while still showing day-to-day fluctuations by factors of a few. There is\nevidence that during this last phase of radio activity the magnetar had a steep\nradio spectrum, in contrast to earlier behavior. There was no secular decrease\nthat presaged its radio demise. During this time the pulse profile continued to\ndisplay large variations, and polarimetry indicates that the magnetic geometry\nremained consistent with that of earlier times. We supplement these results\nwith X-ray timing of the pulsar from its outburst in 2003 up to 2014. For the\nfirst 4 years, XTE J1810-197 experienced non-monotonic excursions in f-dot by\nat least a factor of 8. But since 2007, its f-dot has remained relatively\nstable near its minimum observed value. The only apparent event in the X-ray\nrecord that is possibly contemporaneous with the radio shut-down is a decrease\nof ~20% in the hot-spot flux in 2008-2009, to a stable, minimum value. However,\nthe permanence of the high-amplitude, thermal X-ray pulse, even after the radio\ndemise, implies continuing magnetar activity. \n\n"}

These\nclusters, which span 0 < z < 1.5, were drawn from a larger, mass-selected\nsample of galaxy clusters discovered in the 2500 square degree South Pole\nTelescope Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey. With a total combined exposure\ntime of 9.1 Ms, these data yield the strongest constraints to date on the\nevolution of the metal content of the intracluster medium (ICM). We find no\nevidence for strong evolution in the global (r<R500) ICM metallicity (dZ/dz =\n-0.06 +/- 0.04 Zsun), with a mean value at z=0.6 of <Z> = 0.23 +/- 0.01 Zsun\nand a scatter of 0.08 +/- 0.01 Zsun. These results imply that >60% of the\nmetals in the ICM were already in place at z=1 (at 95% confidence), consistent\nwith the picture of an early (z>1) enrichment. We find, in agreement with\nprevious works, a significantly higher mean value for the metallicity in the\ncenters of cool core clusters versus non-cool core clusters. We find weak\nevidence for evolution in the central metallicity of cool core clusters (dZ/dz\n= -0.21 +/- 0.11 Zsun), which is sufficient to account for this enhanced\ncentral metallicity over the past ~10 Gyr. We find no evidence for metallicity\nevolution outside of the core (dZ/dz = -0.03 +/- 0.06 Zsun), and no significant\ndifference in the core-excised metallicity between cool core and non-cool core\nclusters. This suggests that strong radio-mode AGN feedback does not\nsignificantly alter the distribution of metals at r>0.15R500. Given the\nlimitations of current-generation X-ray telescopes in constraining the ICM\nmetallicity at z>1, significant improvements on this work will likely require\nnext-generation X-ray missions. \n\n"}

The ambient gas serves as a potential reservoir of mass to be\naccreted on to the compact object. If the compact object launches jets as it\naccretes mass, the jets might reduce the accretion rate as they deposit energy\nto the ambient gas, or even remove the entire ambient gas, hence closing a\nnegative feedback cycle. \n\n"}

It pursues three core programs: APOGEE-2, MaNGA, and\neBOSS. In addition, eBOSS contains two major subprograms: TDSS and SPIDERS.\nThis paper describes the first data release from SDSS-IV, Data Release 13\n(DR13), which contains new data, reanalysis of existing data sets and, like all\nSDSS data releases, is inclusive of previously released data. DR13 makes\npublicly available 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations of\nnearby galaxies from MaNGA, the first data released from this survey. It\nincludes new observations from eBOSS, completing SEQUELS. In addition to\ntargeting galaxies and quasars, SEQUELS also targeted variability-selected\nobjects from TDSS and X-ray selected objects from SPIDERS. DR13 includes new\nreductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric\ncalibration and redshift classification. DR13 releases new reductions of the\nAPOGEE-1 data from SDSS-III, with abundances of elements not previously\nincluded and improved stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars.

Since most of the elements visible in\nX-rays are formed by type Ia (SNIa) and/or core-collapse (SNcc) supernovae,\nmeasuring their abundances gives us direct information on the nucleosynthesis\nproducts of billions of SNe since the epoch of the star formation peak (z~2-3).\nIn this study, we compare the most accurate average X/Fe abundance ratios\n(compiled in a previous work from XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS observations of 44\ngalaxy clusters, groups, and ellipticals), representative of the chemical\nenrichment in the nearby ICM, to various SNIa and SNcc nucleosynthesis models\nfound in the literature. The use of a SNcc model combined to any favoured\nstandard SNIa model (deflagration or delayed-detonation) fails to reproduce our\nabundance pattern. In particular, the Ca/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios are significantly\nunderestimated by the models. We show that the Ca/Fe ratio can be reproduced\nbetter, either by taking a SNIa delayed-detonation model that matches the\nobservations of the Tycho supernova remnant, or by adding a contribution from\nthe Ca-rich gap transient SNe, whose material should easily mix into the hot\nICM. On the other hand, the Ni/Fe ratio can be reproduced better by assuming\nthat both deflagration and delayed-detonation SNIa contribute in similar\nproportions to the ICM enrichment. In either case, the fraction of SNIa over\nthe total number of SNe (SNIa+SNcc) contributing to the ICM enrichment ranges\nwithin 29-45%. This fraction is found to be systematically higher than the\ncorresponding SNIa/SNe fraction contributing to the enrichment of the\nproto-solar environnement (15-25%).

Our\nnewly constructed sample contains 91 nebular spectra of 38 SNe IIP, which is\nthe largest dataset of its kind ever analysed in one study, and many of the\nobjects have complementary photometric data. We determined the peak and total\nluminosity, velocity of the peak, HWHM intensity, and profile shape for many\nemission lines. Temporal evolution of these values and various flux ratios are\nstudied. We also investigate the correlations between these measurements and\nphotometric observables, such as the peak and plateau absolute magnitudes and\nthe late-time light curve decline rates in various optical bands. The strongest\nand most robust result we find is that the luminosities of all spectral\nfeatures (except those of helium) tend to be higher in objects with steeper\nlate-time V-band decline rates. A steep late-time V-band slope likely arises\nfrom less efficient trapping of gamma-rays and positrons, which could be caused\nby multidimensional effects such as clumping of the ejecta or asphericity of\nthe explosion itself. Furthermore, if gamma-rays and positrons can escape more\neasily, then so can photons via the observed emission lines, leading to more\nluminous spectral features. It is also shown that SNe IIP with larger\nprogenitor stars have ejecta with a more physically extended oxygen layer that\nis well-mixed with the hydrogen layer. In addition, we find a subset of objects\nwith evidence for asymmetric Ni-56 ejection, likely bipolar in shape.

This excess is interpreted primarily as a\nresult of weaker metal line blanketing due to much lower abundance of\niron-group elements in the outer ejecta. Because these elements originate\neither from the natal metallicity of the star, or have been newly produced, our\nobservation provides direct evidence that little of these freshly synthesized\nmaterial, including 56Ni, was mixed into the outer ejecta, and the progenitor\nmetallicity is likely sub-solar.

Our results show\nthat for some DMEOSs, the mass-radius relations are in agreement with new\nobservations, e.g. EXO 1745-248, 4U 1608-52, and 4U 1820-30, which are\ninconsistent with the normal neutron stars. We conclude that both DMEOSs and\ncentral pressure ratios of DM to NM affect the slope of the mass-radius\nrelation of DMANSs. This is because of the interaction between DM and NM, which\nleads to gravitationally or self-bound DMANSs. We study the radius of the NM\nsphere as well as the radius of the DM halo for different DMANSs. The results\nconfirm that, in some cases, a NM sphere with a small radius is surrounded by a\nhalo of DM with a larger radius. Our calculations verify that, due to the\ndifferent degrees of DM domination in DMANSs, with a value of the visible\nradius of a star two possible DMANSs with different masses can be exist. The\ngravitational redshift is also calculated for DMANSs with different DMEOSs and\ncentral pressure ratios. The results explain that the existence of DM in a\nDMANS leads to higher values of gravitational redshift of the star. \n\n"}

The lines\npresumably emit from TDE debris or circumnuclear clouds photoionized by the\nflare.

The distinctive spectral states are not strongly\nrelated to observed luminosity and velocity, nor to SMBH mass estimates. We use\nexhaustive photoionization modelling to map the domain of fluxes and cloud\nproperties that yield (e.g.) a He-overbright state where a large\nHeII(4686A)/H$\\alpha$ line-ratio creates an illusion of helium enrichment.\nAlthough observed line ratios occur in a plausible minority of cases, AGN-like\nillumination can not reproduce the observed equivalent widths.

Therefore, they could not\nself-consistently predict their final masses at collapse, or those of the\nresulting supermassive black hole seeds, but rather invoked comparison to\nsimple polytropic models. Here, we systematically examine the birth, evolution\nand collapse of accreting non-rotating supermassive stars under accretion rates\nof 0.01-10 solar masses per year, using the stellar evolution code KEPLER. Our\napproach includes post-Newtonian corrections to the stellar structure and an\nadaptive nuclear network, and can transition to following the hydrodynamic\nevolution of supermassive stars after they encounter the general relativistic\ninstability. We find that this instability triggers the collapse of the star at\nmasses of 150,000-330,000 solar masses for accretion rates of 0.1-10 solar\nmasses per year, and that the final mass of the star scales roughly\nlogarithmically with the rate.

It is then important to study variations of evolutionary\nchannels for merging BHs, which might instead form accreting BHs and become\nULXs. It was recently shown that massive binaries with mass ratios close to\nunity and tight orbits can undergo efficient rotational mixing and evolve\nchemically homogeneously, resulting in a compact BH binary. We study similar\nsystems by computing ~120000 detailed binary models with the MESA code covering\na wide range of initial parameters. For initial mass ratios M2/M1~0.1-0.4,\nprimaries >40Msun can evolve chemically homogeneously, remaining compact and\nforming a BH without undergoing Roche-lobe overflow. The secondary then expands\nand transfers mass to the BH, initiating a ULX phase. We predict that ~1 out of\n10^4 massive stars evolves this way, and that in the local universe 0.13 ULXs\nper Msun yr^-1 of star-formation rate are observable, with a strong preference\nfor low-metallicities. At metallicities log Z>-3, BH masses in ULXs are limited\nto 60Msun due to the occurrence of pair-instability supernovae which leave no\nremnant, resulting in an X-ray luminosity cut-off. At lower metallicities, very\nmassive stars can avoid exploding as pair-instability supernovae and instead\nform BHs with masses above 130Msun, producing a gap in the ULX luminosity\ndistribution.

We employ the radiative\ntransfer code SuperNu and state-of-the-art LTE opacities for a few\nrepresentative elements from the wind and dynamical ejecta (Cr, Pd, Se, Te, Br,\nZr, Sm, Ce, Nd, U) to calculate synthetic light curves and spectra for a range\nof ejecta morphologies. The radioactive power of the resulting macronova is\ncalculated with the detailed input of decay products. We assess the detection\nprospects for our most complex models, based on the portion of viewing angles\nthat are sufficiently bright, at different cosmological redshifts ($z$). The\nbrighter emission from the wind is unobscured by the lanthanides (or actinides)\nin some of the models, permitting non-zero detection probabilities for\nredshifts up to $z=0.07$. We also find the nuclear mass model and the resulting\nradioactive heating rate are crucial for the detectability. While for the most\npessimistic heating rate (from the FRDM model) no reasonable increase in the\nejecta mass or velocity, or wind mass or velocity, can possibly make the light\ncurves agree with the observed nIR excess after GRB130603B, a more optimistic\nheating rate (from the Duflo-Zuker model) leads to good agreement. We conclude\nthat future reliable macronova observations would constrain nuclear heating\nrates, and consequently help constrain nuclear mass models. \n\n"}

We develop a turbulence model for neutrino-driven convection, and\nshow that this turbulence model reduces the condition for explosions by about\n30%, in concordance with multi-dimensional simulations. In addition, we\nidentify which turbulent terms enable explosions. Contrary to prior\nsuggestions, turbulent ram pressure is not the dominant factor in reducing the\ncondition for explosion. Instead, there are many contributing factors, ram\npressure being only one of them, but the dominant factor is turbulent\ndissipation (TD). Primarily, TD provides extra heating, adding significant\nthermal pressure, and reducing the condition for explosion. The source of this\nTD power is turbulent kinetic energy, which ultimately derives its energy from\nthe higher potential of an unstable convective profile. Investigating a\nturbulence model in conjunction with an explosion condition enables insight\nthat is difficult to glean from merely analyzing complex multi-dimensional\nsimulations.

Nonetheless, as a\nresult of their uncertain kinematics, the DM content and astrophysical\nJ-factors of dSphs are usually affected by significant errors. In this paper,\nwe study a sample of 36 dIrrs as prospective targets of interest. In the\nframework of the universal rotation curve, the kinematics of dIrr galaxies\nprovides a good estimation of their DM halo density distribution and,\nconsequently, of their astrophysical J-factors. We calculate the J-factors for\nthese 36 dIrr galaxies. We find a range of values comparable with the J-factors\nof dSph galaxies.

SN\n2009ip-like events are characterized by a long-lasting phase of erratic\nvariability which ends with two luminous outbursts a few weeks apart. The\nsecond outburst is significantly more luminous (about 3 mag) than the first.

By inspecting archival data, a faint\nsource at the position of SN 2016bdu is detectable several times in the past\nfew years.

We perform atomic structure calculations for r-process\nelements: Se (Z=34), Ru (Z=44), Te (Z=52), Ba (Z=56), Nd (Z=60), and Er (Z=68).\nWe confirm that the opacities from bound-bound transitions of open f-shell,\nLanthanide elements (Nd and Er) are higher than those of the other elements\nover a wide wavelength range. The opacities of open s-shell (Ba), p-shell (Se\nand Te), and d-shell (Ru) elements are lower than those of open f-shell\nelements and their transitions are concentrated in the ultraviolet wavelengths.\nWe show that the optical brightness can be different by >2 mag depending on the\nelement abundances in the ejecta such that post-merger, Lanthanide-free ejecta\nproduce brighter and bluer optical emission. Such blue emission from\npost-merger ejecta can be observed from the polar directions if the mass of the\npreceding dynamical ejecta in these regions is small. For the ejecta mass of\n0.01 Msun, observed magnitudes of the blue emission will reach 21.0 mag (100\nMpc) and 22.5 mag (200 Mpc) in g and r bands within a few days after the\nmerger, which are detectable with 1m or 2m-class telescopes. \n\n"}

Our galaxy models exhibit a first burst of star\nformation that injects CRs at supernovae. Once CRs have sufficiently\naccumulated in our Milky-Way like galaxy, their buoyancy force overcomes the\nmagnetic tension of the toroidal disk field. As field lines open up, they\nenable anisotropically diffusing CRs to escape into the halo and to accelerate\na bubble-like, CR-dominated outflow.

We show that the\nfraction of systems reaching high eccentricities is enhanced relative to triple\nsystems, over a broader range of parameter space.

This process\ncan be described by the Parker equation, which calculates the phase space\ndistribution of GCRs depending on the main modulation processes: convection,\ndrifts, diffusion and adiabatic energy changes. A first order approximation of\nthis equation is the force field approach, reducing it to a one-parameter\ndependency, the solar modulation potential $\\phi$. Utilizing this approach, it\nis possible to reconstruct $\\phi$ from ground based and spacecraft\nmeasurements. However, it has been shown previously that $\\phi$ depends not\nonly on the Local Interstellar Spectrum (LIS) but also on the energy range of\ninterest. We have investigated this energy dependence further, using published\nproton intensity spectra obtained by PAMELA as well as heavier nuclei\nmeasurements from IMP-8 and ACE/CRIS. Our results show severe limitations at\nlower energies including a strong dependence on the solar magnetic epoch. Based\non these findings, we will outline a new tool to describe GCR proton spectra in\nthe energy range from a few hundred MeV to tens of GeV over the last solar\ncycles.

Although our RSG models are computed with the MESA code,\nour result may be applied to other stellar evolution codes, including the BEC\nand TWIN codes. We find evidence that the mixing length increases with\nincreasing metallicity for both cases where the TiO and SED temperatures of\nRSGs are used for the calibration.

This paper places constraints\non progenitor initial mass and metallicity in distinct core-collapse SN\nsubclasses, through a study of the parent stellar populations at the explosion\nsites. Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) of 83 nearby SN explosion sites with a\nmedian distance of 18 Mpc has been collected and analysed, enabling detection\nand spectral extraction of the parent stellar population of SN progenitors.\nFrom the parent stellar population spectrum, the initial mass and metallicity\nof the coeval progenitor are derived by means of comparison to simple stellar\npopulation models and strong-line methods. Additionally, near-infrared IFS was\nemployed to characterise the star formation history at the explosion sites. No\nsignificant metallicity differences are observed among distinct SN types. The\ntypical progenitor mass is found to be highest for SN Ic, followed by type Ib,\nthen types IIb and II.

Since bow shocks are aspherical\nstructures, light scattering within them produces a net polarization signal\neven if the region is spatially unresolved. Scattering opacity arising from\nfree electrons and dust leads to a distribution of polarized intensity across\nthe bow shock structure.

Instead of a ~100-day plateau as\nobserved for ordinary type II-P supernovae, the light curve of iPTF14hls has at\nleast five distinct peaks, followed by a steep decline at ~1000 days since\ndiscovery. Until 500 days since discovery, the effective temperature of\niPTF14hls is roughly constant at 5000-6000K . In this paper we propose that\niPTF14hls is likely powered by intermittent fallback accretion. It is found\nthat the light curve of iPTF14hls can be well fit by the usual t^{-5/3}\naccretion law until ~1000 days post discovery when the light curve transitions\nto a steep decline. To account for this steep decline, we suggest a power-law\ndensity profile for the late accreted material, rather than the constant\nprofile as appropriated for the t^{-5/3} accretion law. Detailed modeling\nindicates that the total fallback mass is ~0.2M_{sun}, with an ejecta mass\nM_{ej}~21M_{sun}.

Building such relationship is critical in controlling systematic errors\nassociated with supernova cosmology.

Because wind acceleration makes the\nwind velocities near the progenitors low, the density of the immediate vicinity\nof the red supergiant supernova progenitors can be higher than that\nextrapolated by using a constant terminal wind velocity. Therefore, even if the\nmass-loss rate of the progenitor is relatively low, it can have a dense\ncircumstellar medium at the immediate stellar vicinity and the early light\ncurves of Type IIP supernovae are significantly affected by it.

We\nshow that the bias is a multivariate function of halo properties that falls\ninto three regimes. For massive haloes, halo mass explains the majority of bias\nvariation. For early-forming haloes, bias depends sensitively on the recent\nmass accretion history. For low-mass and late-forming haloes, bias depends more\non the structure of a halo such as its shape and spin.

The\nr'- and K_s-band light curves show rectangular, flat-bottomed dips, similar to\nthe X-ray mode-switching (active-passive state transitions) behaviour observed\npreviously. The cross-correlation function (CCF) of the optical and near-IR\ndata reveals a strong, broad negative anti-correlation at negative lags, a\nbroad positive correlation at positive lags, with a strong, positive narrow\ncorrelation superimposed. The shape of the CCF resembles the CCF of black hole\nX-ray binaries but the time-scales are different. The features can be explained\nby reprocessing and a hot accretion flow close to the neutron star's\nmagnetospheric radius. The optical emission is dominated by the reprocessed\ncomponent, whereas the near-IR emission contains the emission from plasmoids in\nthe hot accretion flow and a reprocessed component. The rapid active-passive\nstate transition occurs when the hot accretion flow material is channelled onto\nthe neutron star and is expelled from its magnetosphere.

The dip at negative lags corresponds to the suppression of the\nnear-IR synchrotron component in the hot flow, whereas the broad positive\ncorrelation at positive lags is driven by the increased synchrotron emission of\nthe outflowing plasmoids.

To illustrate this connection between macroscopic\nobservables and microphysics, we review calculations of vortex interactions\nfocusing on Kelvin wave excitations and determine the corresponding mutual\nfriction strength for realistic microscopic parameters in the inner crust.\nThese density-dependent crustal coupling profiles are combined with a\nsimplified treatment of the core coupling and implemented in a three-component\nneutron star model to construct a predictive framework for glitch rises. As a\nresult of the density-dependent dynamics, we find the superfluid to transfer\nangular momentum to different parts of the crust and the core on different\ntimescales. This can cause the spin frequency change to become non-monotonic in\ntime, allowing for a maximum value much larger than the measured glitch size,\nas well as a delay in the recovery. The exact shape of the calculated glitch\nrise is strongly dependent on the relative strength between the crust and core\nmutual friction, providing the means to probe not only the crustal superfluid\nbut also the deeper neutron star interior.

The WL effect depends on the lensing potential (LP) caused by matter\nperturbations, the distribution of which at cosmological scales is given by the\nmatter power spectrum (MPS). Therefore, the WL effect on the CMB $B$ mode is\naffected by the MPS. Considering the effect of the ensemble average energy\ndensity of the PMF, which we call \"the background PMF,\" on the MPS, the\namplitude of MPS is suppressed in the wave number range of $k>0.01~h$\nMpc$^{-1}$.The MPS affects the LP and the WL effect in the CMB $B$ mode;\nhowever, the PMF can damp this effect. Previous studies of the CMB $B$ mode\nwith the PMF have only considered the vector and tensor modes.

We show three different freeze-out\ntypes of the dark matter relic, called (i) the conventional WIMP dark matter,\n(ii) the unconventional WIMP dark matter and (iii) the cannibally co-decaying\ndark matter, depending on the magnitudes of the mixing angles between the\nhidden Higgs and visible two-Higgs doublets. The dark matter in the hidden\nsector is secluded from detections in the direct searches or colliders, while\nthe dark matter annihilation signals are not suppressed in a general hidden\nsector dark matter model. We discuss the constraints from observations of the\ndwarf spheroidal galaxies and the Fermi-LAT projected sensitivity. \n\n"}

Abstract: Wide-field optical surveys have begun to uncover large samples of fast\n(t_rise < 5d), luminous (M_peak < -18), blue transients. While commonly\nattributed to the breakout of a supernova shock into a dense wind, the great\ndistances to the transients of this class found so far have hampered detailed\ninvestigation of their properties. We present photometry and spectroscopy from\na comprehensive worldwide campaign to observe AT2018cow (ATLAS18qqn), the first\nfast-luminous optical transient to be found in real time at low redshift. Our\nfirst spectra (<2 days after discovery) are entirely featureless. A very broad\nabsorption feature suggestive of near-relativistic velocities develops between\n3-8 days, then disappears. Broad emission features of H and He develop after\n>10 days. The spectrum remains extremely hot throughout its evolution, and the\nphotospheric radius contracts with time (receding below R<10^14 cm after 1\nmonth). This behaviour does not match that of any known supernova, although a\nrelativistic jet within a fallback supernova could explain some of the observed\nfeatures. Alternatively, the transient could originate from the disruption of a\nstar by an intermediate-mass black hole, although this would require\nlong-lasting emission of highly super-Eddington thermal radiation. In either\ncase, AT2018cow suggests that the population of fast luminous transients\nrepresents a new class of astrophysical event.

Ivanova (2006) put forward the possibility that\nsome of the BHLMXBs may harbour pre-main-sequence (MS) donor stars, in order to\nexplain the Li-overabundances in three BHLMXBs.

I start from long-term evolution (on the timescale when\ninstability significantly changes the spin frequency). For this case, I reduce\nevolution equations to one differential equation and demonstrate that it can be\ndirectly derived from energy conservation law. This equation governs evolution\nrate through sequence of thermally equilibrium states and provides linear\ncoupling for the cooling power and rotation energy losses via gravitational\nwave emission. In particular, it shows that differential rotation do not affect\nlong-term spin-down. On the contrary, on the short timescales, differential\nrotation can significantly modify the apparent spin-down, if one examines a\nstrongly unstable star with very small initial amplitude of unstable mode.

Mergers,\nas well as stellar core-collapse events (type II SNe and long-duration GRBs)\nare accompanied by long-lived sub-relativistic components powered by\nradioactive decay of unstable elements produced in the explosion. It is\ntherefore interesting to explore whether short duration events also have ejecta\npowered by radioactivity (i.e. that are supernova-like). Observations already\ninform us that any supernova like component in the first few well studied short\nhard bursts must be fainter than those typical of type Ia or core-collapse\nsupernovae. Rather than refer to weaker supernova-like component as\n``mini-super nova'', an etymologically indefensible term, I use the term {\\it\nmacronova}. I investigate the observability of macronovae powered by neutron\ndecay and by radioactive Nickel. Separately, I note that a macronova will\nreprocess energetic emission arising from a long lived central source. I find\nthat surprisingly interesting limits on the basic parameters of macronovae can\nbe obtained provided observations are obtained with current 10-m class\ntelescopes over a range of one hour to one day following the burst. \n\n"}
{"id": "astro-ph/0511811", "contents": "Title: Compact Object Modeling with the StarTrack Population Synthesis Code Abstract: We present a comprehensive description of the population synthesis code\nStarTrack. The original code has been significantly modified and updated.\nSpecial emphasis is placed here on processes leading to the formation and\nfurther evolution of compact objects (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black\nholes). Both single and binary star populations are considered. The code now\nincorporates detailed calculations of all mass-transfer phases, a full\nimplementation of orbital evolution due to tides, as well as the most recent\nestimates of magnetic braking. This updated version of StarTrack can be used\nfor a wide variety of problems, with relevance to many current and planned\nobservatories, e.g., studies of X-ray binaries (Chandra, XMM-Newton),\ngravitational radiation sources (LIGO, LISA), and gamma-ray burst progenitors\n(HETE-II, Swift). The code has already been used in studies of Galactic and\nextra-galactic X-ray binary populations, black holes in young star clusters,\nType Ia supernova progenitors, and double compact object populations. Here we\ndescribe in detail the input physics, we present the code calibration and\ntests, and we outline our current studies in the context of X-ray binary\npopulations. \n\n"}
{"id": "astro-ph/0608324", "contents": "Title: Cosmological Implications of the Second Parameter of Type Ia Supernovae Abstract: Theoretical models predict that the initial metallicity of the progenitor of\na Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) affects the peak of the supernova light curve. This\ncan cause a deviation from the standard light curve calibration employed when\nusing SNe Ia as standardizable distance candles and, if there is a systematic\nevolution of the metallicity of SN Ia progenitors, could affect the\ndetermination of cosmological parameters. Here we show that this metallicity\neffect can be substantially larger than has been estimated previously, when the\nneutronisation in the immediate pre-explosion phase in the CO white dwarf is\ntaken into account, and quantitatively assess the importance of metallicity\nevolution for determining cosmological parameters. We show that, in principle,\na moderate and plausible amount of metallicity evolution could mimic a\nlambda-dominated, flat Universe in an open, lambda-free Universe. However, the\neffect of metallicity evolution appears not large enough to explain the high-z\nSN Ia data in a flat Universe, for which there is strong independent evidence,\nwithout a cosmological constant. We also estimate the systematic uncertainties\nintroduced by metallicity evolution in a lambda-dominated, flat Universe. We\nfind that metallicity evolution may limit the precision with which Omega_m and\nw can be measured and that it will be difficult to distinguish evolution of the\nequation of state of dark energy from metallicity evolution, at least from SN\nIa data alone. \n\n"}
{"id": "astro-ph/0703139", "contents": "Title: Evolution of asymptotic giant branch stars I. Updated synthetic TP-AGB\n  models and their basic calibration Abstract: We present new synthetic models of the TP-AGB evolution. They are computed\nfor 7 values of initial metal content (Z from 0.0001 to 0.03) and for initial\nmasses between 0.5 and 5.0 Msun, thus extending the low- and intermediate-mass\ntracks of Girardi et al. (2000) until the beginning of the post-AGB phase. The\ncalculations are performed by means of a synthetic code that incorporates many\nrecent improvements, among which we mention: (1) the use of detailed and\nrevised analytical relations to describe the evolution of quiescent luminosity,\ninter-pulse period, third dredge-up, hot bottom burning, pulse cycle luminosity\nvariations, etc.; (2) the use of variable molecular opacities -- i.e. opacities\nconsistent with the changing photospheric chemical composition -- in the\nintegration of a complete envelope model, instead of the standard choice of\nscaled-solar opacities; (3) the use of formalisms for the mass-loss rates\nderived from pulsating dust-driven wind models of C- and O-rich AGB stars; and\n(4) the switching of pulsation modes between the first overtone and the\nfundamental one along the evolution, which has consequences in terms of the\nhistory of mass loss. It follows that, in addition to the time evolution on the\nHR diagram, the new models predict in a consistent fashion also variations in\nsurface chemical compositions, pulsation modes and periods, and mass-loss\nrates. The onset and efficiency of the third dredge-up process are calibrated\nin order to reproduce basic observables like the carbon star luminosity\nfunctions in the Magellanic Clouds, and TP-AGB lifetimes (star counts) in\nMagellanic Cloud clusters. Forthcoming papers will present the theoretical\nisochrones and chemical yields derived from these tracks, and additional tests\nperformed with the aid of a complete population synthesis code. \n\n"}
