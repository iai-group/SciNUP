In the discussion of\norientability, Hochschild homology is replaced by a twisted version which\navoids the dimension drop. The twisted Hochschild cycle representing an\norientation is related to the volume form of the distinguished covariant\ndifferential calculus. Integration over the volume form defines a twisted\ncyclic 2-cocycle which computes the q-winding numbers of quantum line bundles.\nSecond, a \"twisted\" Chern character from equivariant K0-theory to even twisted\ncyclic homology is introduced which gives rise to a Chern-Connes pairing\nbetween equivariant K0-theory and twisted cyclic cohomology.

Recently, superconductivity has been discovered in\niron-based layered compound $LaO_{1-x}F_xFeAs$ with $T_c$=26 K\\cite{yoichi},\nand it competes with spin-density-wave (SDW) order\\cite{dong}.

We\nstart by measuring the distributions of avalanche and transient times in Random\nBoolean Networks (RBNs) and in the \\emph{Drosophila} polarity network by exact\nenumeration. A transient time is the duration of the transient from a starting\nstate to an attractor. An avalanche is a special transient which starts as\nsingle Boolean element perturbation of an attractor state. Significant\ndifferences at short times between the avalanche and the transient times for\nRBNs with small connectivity $K$ -- compared to the number of elements $N$ --\nindicate that attractors tend to cluster in configuration space. In addition,\none bit flip has a non-negligible chance to put an attractor state directly\nonto another attractor. This clustering is also present in the segment polarity\ngene network of \\emph{Drosophila melanogaster}, suggesting that this may be a\nrobust feature of biological regulatory networks.

We compare these data to\nsubmillimetre data taken using the SCUBA camera on the JCMT, and far-infrared\ndata taken with the ISOPHOT camera on board the ISO satellite. All of the data\nshow a relation between the position of the peak of emission and the wavelength\nfor the core of L1155. We interpret this as a temperature gradient. We fit\nmodified blackbody curves to the spectral energy distributions at two positions\nin the core and see that the central core in L1155 (L1155C) is approximately 2\ndegrees warmer at one edge than it is in the centre. We consider a number of\npossible heating sources and conclude that the A6V star BD+67 1263 is the most\nlikely candidate. This star is at a distance of 0.7 pc from the front of L1155C\nin the plane of the sky. We carry out radiative transfer modelling of the\nL1155C core including the effects from the nearby star.

We study three typical star-forming galaxies in haloes of approx. 5 10^11\nMsun at z=2.3, when they were not undergoing a major merger. The steady gas\nsupply by cold streams leads to gravitationally unstable, turbulent discs,\nwhich fragment into giant clumps and transient features on a dynamical\ntimescale. The disc clumps are not associated with dark-matter haloes. The\nclumpy discs are self-regulated by gravity in a marginaly unstable state. Clump\nmigration and angular-momentum transfer on an orbital timescale help the growth\nof a central bulge with a mass comparable to the disc. The continuous gas input\nkeeps the system of clumpy disc and bulge in a near \"steady state\", for several\nGyr.

In addition they are at the\nforefront in terms of implementations. As such they represent an excellent\nopportunity to move towards integrated protocols involving many of these\nelements. In this paper we look at expressing and extending graph state secret\nsharing and MBQC in a common framework and graphical language related to flow.\nWe do so with two main contributions.\n  First we express in entirely graphical terms which set of players can access\nwhich information in graph state secret sharing protocols. These succinct\ngraphical descriptions of access allow us to take known results from graph\ntheory to make statements on the generalisation of the previous schemes to\npresent new secret sharing protocols.\n  Second, we give a set of necessary conditions as to when a graph with flow,\ni.e. capable of performing a class of unitary operations, can be extended to\ninclude vertices which can be ignored, pointless measurements, and hence\nconsidered as unauthorised players in terms of secret sharing, or error qubits\nin terms of fault tolerance. This offers a way to extend existing MBQC patterns\nto secret sharing protocols.

This can be modeled by a\nsemiclassical expansion about a constant field for the vector potential, A_0,\nwhich is diagonal in color. We compute the shear viscosity in the semi-QGP by\nusing the Boltzmann equation in the presence of this background field. To\nleading, logarithmic order in weak coupling, the dominant diagrams are given by\nthe usual scattering processes of 2 -> 2 particles. For simplicity we also\nassume that both the number of colors and flavors are large. Near the critical\ntemperature T_c, where the expectation value of the Polyakov loop is small, the\noverall density of colored fields decreases according to their color\nrepresentation, with the density of quarks vanishes linearly with the loop, and\nthat of gluons, quadratically.

Radio morphology classes include core-only (core), core-lobe (lobe),\ncore-jet (jet), lobe-core-lobe (triple), and double-lobe. We examine the\noptical colors of radio-morphology subsamples and find that radio quasars with\ncore emission unresolved by FIRST (on 5\" scale) have a redder color\ndistribution than radio-quiet quasars (S_{20}<1mJy); other classes of radio\nquasars have optical color distributions similar to the radio-quiet quasars.\nThis analysis also suggests that optical colors of z<2.7 SDSS quasars are not\nstrongly (<0.1mag) biased blue. We show that the radio core-to-lobe flux\ndensity ratio (R) and the radio-to-optical (i-band) ratio of the quasar core\n(RI) are correlated, suggesting that both parameters are indicative of\nline-of-sight orientation.

However, the combination of 2MASS near-infrared (NIR) and\nSpitzer-IRAC mid-infrared (MIR) photometry enables a powerful method for\ndetermining the line of sight reddening to any star: the sampled wavelengths\nlie in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spectral energy distribution of most\nstars, where, to first order, all stars have essentially the same intrinsic\ncolor. Thus, changes in stellar NIR-MIR colors due to interstellar reddening\nare readily apparent, and (under an assumed extinction law) the observed colors\nand magnitudes of stars can be easily and accurately restored to their\nintrinsic values, greatly increasing their usefulness for Galactic structure\nstudies. In this paper we explore this \"Rayleigh-Jeans Color Excess\" (RJCE)\nmethod and demonstrate that use of even a simple variant of the RJCE method\nbased on a single reference color, (H-[4.5um]), can rather accurately remove\ndust effects from previously uninterpretable 2MASS color-magnitude diagrams of\nstars in fields along the heavily reddened Galactic mid-plane, with results far\nsuperior to those derived from application of other dereddening methods.

However, the only numerical\nevidence for this has come from alpha disk models, where the magnetic field\nevolution is not followed, and the effect of turbulence is parametrized by\nLaplacian viscosity. We aim to establish the phenomenology of the flow in the\ntransition in 3D resistive-magnetohydrodynamical models. We model the\ntransition by a sharp jump in resistivity, as expected in the inner dead zone\nboundary, using the Pencil Code to simulate the flow. We find that vortices are\nreadily excited in the dead side of the transition. We measure the mass\naccretion rate finding similar levels of Reynolds stress at the dead and active\nzones, at the $\\alpha\\approx 10^{-2}$ level. The vortex sits in a pressure\nmaximum and does not migrate, surviving until the end of the simulation. A\npressure maximum in the active zone also triggers the RWI. The magnetized\nvortex that results should be disrupted by parasitical magneto-elliptic\ninstabilities, yet it subsists in high resolution. This suggests that either\nthe parasitic modes are still numerically damped, or that the RWI supplies\nvorticity faster than they can destroy it. We conclude that the resistive\ntransition between the active and dead zones in the inner regions of\nprotoplanetary disks, if sharp enough, can indeed excite vortices via RWI. Our\nresults lend credence to previous works that relied on the alpha-disk\napproximation, and caution against the use of overly reduced azimuthal coverage\non modeling this transition. \n\n"}

We investigate\nto what extent information from the lightcurves can identify blend scenarios\nand eliminate them as planet candidates, to significantly decrease the amount\nof follow-up observing time required to identify the true exoplanet systems. If\na lightcurve has a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio, a distinction can\nbe made between the lightcurve of a stellar binary blended with a third star\nand the lightcurve of a transiting exoplanet system. We perform simulations to\ndetermine what signal-to-noise level is required to make the distinction\nbetween blended and non-blended systems as function of transit depth and impact\nparameter. Subsequently we test our method on real data from the first IRa01\nfield observed by the CoRoT satellite, concentrating on the 51 candidates\nalready identified by the CoRoT team. About 70% of the planet candidates in the\nCoRoT IRa01 field are best fit with an impact parameter of b>0.85, while less\nthan 15% are expected in this range considering random orbital inclinations.

This is an unfavorable scenario for secrecy performance as the\nsystem is interference-limited. In the literature, assuming that the receiver\noperates in half duplex (HD) mode, the aforementioned problem has been\naddressed via use of cooperating nodes who act as jammers to confound the\neavesdropper. This paper investigates an alternative solution, which assumes\nthe availability of a full duplex (FD) receiver. In particular, while receiving\ndata, the receiver transmits jamming noise to degrade the eavesdropper channel.\nThe proposed self-protection scheme eliminates the need for external helpers\nand provides system robustness. For the case in which global channel state\ninformation is available, we aim to design the optimal jamming covariance\nmatrix that maximizes the secrecy rate and mitigates loop interference\nassociated with the FD operation. We consider both fixed and optimal linear\nreceiver design at the destination, and show that the optimal jamming\ncovariance matrix is rank-1, and can be found via an efficient 1-D search. For\nthe case in which only statistical information on the eavesdropper channel is\navailable, the optimal power allocation is studied in terms of ergodic and\noutage secrecy rates.

In particular, many studies in RQI have been focused on\nthe effects of non-uniform motion on entanglement, the main resource of quantum\ninformation protocols. Early investigations in this direction were performed in\nhighly idealized settings that prompted questions as to the practical\naccessibility of these results. To overcome these limitations it is necessary\nto consider quantum systems that are in principle accessible to localized\nobservers. In this thesis we present such a model, the rigid relativistic\ncavity, and its extensions, focusing on the effects of motion on entanglement\nand applications such as quantum teleportation. We study cavities in (1+1)\ndimensions undergoing non-uniform motion, consisting of segments of uniform\nacceleration and inertial motion of arbitrary duration that allow the involved\nvelocities to become relativistic. The transitions between segments can be\nsharp or smooth and higher dimensions can be incorporated. The primary focus\nlies in the Bogoliubov transformations of the quantum fields, real scalar\nfields or Dirac fields, confined to the cavities.

When a suitable kinematical configuration depending on a single\nmomentum scale $p$ is chosen, only two structures emerge: the tree-level\nfour-gluon vertex, and a tensor orthogonal to it. A detailed numerical analysis\nreveals that the form factor associated with this latter tensor displays a\nchange of sign (zero-crossing) in the deep infrared, and finally diverges\nlogarithmically. The origin of this characteristic behavior is proven to be\nentirely due to the masslessness of the ghost propagators forming the\ncorresponding ghost-loop diagram, in close analogy to a similar effect\nestablished for the three-gluon vertex.

This work describes the\nLALInference software library for Bayesian parameter estimation of compact\nbinary signals, which builds on several previous methods to provide a\nwell-tested toolkit which has already been used for several studies.

The\nproperties of galaxies living in voids are compared with those of galaxies\nliving in the void shells and with a control sample, representing the general\ngalaxy population. Void galaxies appear to form stars more efficiently than\nshell galaxies and the control sample. This result can not be interpreted as a\nconsequence of the bias towards low masses in underdense regions, as void\ngalaxy subsamples with the same mass distribution as the control sample also\nshow statistically different specific star formation rates. This highlights the\nfact that galaxy evolution in voids is slower with respect to the evolution of\nthe general population. Nevertheless, when only the star forming galaxies are\nconsidered, we find that the star formation rate is insensitive to the\nenvironment, as the main sequence is remarkably constant in the three samples\nunder consideration. This fact implies that environmental effects manifest\nthemselves as fast quenching mechanisms, while leaving the non-quenched\ngalaxies almost unaffected, as their star formation activity is largely\nregulated by the mass of their halo.

We then show that this improved\ndescription is crucial for the bond formation of the Mg$_2$ molecule. In\naddition, the RPAx performs better for the Be$_2$ dissociation curve at large\nnuclear separation but, similar to the RPA, fails around equilibrium due to the\nbuild up of a large repulsion hump.

The step feature is missing and hence the delocalisation\nerror is comparable to the RPA.

The Galactic B[e] star MWC 137 is a prime\nexample of an object with uncertain classification, with previous work\nsuggesting pre- and post-main sequence classification. Our goal is to settle\nthis debate and provide reliable evolutionary classification. Integral field\nspectrograph observations with VLT MUSE of the cluster SH 2-266 are used to\nanalyze the nature of MWC 137. A collimated outflow is discovered that is\ngeometrically centered on MWC 137. The central position of MWC 137 in the\ncluster SH 2-266 within the larger nebula suggests strongly that it is a member\nof this cluster and that it is both at the origin of the nebula and the newly\ndiscovered jet. Comparison of the color-magnitude diagram of the brightest\ncluster stars with stellar evolutionary models results in a distance of about\n5.2$\\pm$1.4 kpc. We estimate that the cluster is at least 3 Myr old. The jet\nextends over 66\" (1.7 pc) projected on the plane of the sky, shows several\nknots, and projected velocities of up to $\\pm$450 km s$^{-1}$. From the Balmer\nemission line decrement of the diffuse intracluster nebulosity we determine\nE(B-V)=1.4 mag for the inner 1' cluster region.

In generalized-gravity models without cold or warm dark matter such\na correlation does not exist, because host galaxies cannot capture in-falling\ndwarf galaxies due to the absence of dark-matter-induced dynamical friction.\nHowever, in such models a correlation is expected to exist between the bulge\nmass and the number of satellite galaxies, because bulges and tidal-dwarf\nsatellite galaxies form in encounters between host galaxies. This is not\npredicted by dark matter models in which bulge mass and the number of\nsatellites are a priori uncorrelated because higher bulge/disk ratios do not\nimply higher dark/luminous ratios. Hence, our correlation reproduces the\nprediction of scenarios without dark matter, whereas an explanation is not\nfound readily from the a priori predictions of the standard scenario with dark\nmatter.

Here we consider the\norigin and dynamical evolution of observed Jupiters, focusing on hot and warm\nJupiters with outer friends. We show that the majority of the observed Jupiter\npairs (twenty out of twenty-four) will be dynamically unstable if the inner\nplanet was placed at >~1AU distance from the stellar host. This finding is at\nodds with formation theories that invoke the migration of such planets from\nsemi-major axes >~1AU due to secular dynamical processes (e.g., secular chaos,\nLidov-Kozai oscillations) coupled with tidal dissipation. In fact, the results\nof N-body integrations show that the evolution of dynamically unstable systems\ndoes not lead to tidal migration but rather to planet ejections and collisions\nwith the host star. This and other arguments lead us to suggest that most of\nthe observed planets with a companion could not have been transported from\nfurther out through secular migration processes.

To bring learning models into this new paradigm, a novel\nelaboration of standard architectures called the competitive overcomplete\noutput layer (COOL) neural network is introduced. Experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of COOL by applying it to fooling, separable concept learning,\none-class neural networks, and standard classification benchmarks. The results\nsuggest that, unlike conventional classifiers, the amount of generalization in\nCOOL networks can be tuned to match the problem. \n\n"}

We here present ALMA CO J=2-1 observations, at an\nimproved spectro-spatial resolution and sensitivity compared to previous CO\nJ=3-2 observations. We find that 1) the CO clump is radially broad, favouring\nthe resonant migration over the giant impact scenario for its dynamical origin,\n2) the CO disk is vertically tilted compared to the main dust disk, at an angle\nconsistent with the scattered light warp. We then use position-velocity\ndiagrams to trace Keplerian radii in the orbital plane of the disk. Assuming a\nperfectly edge-on geometry, this shows a CO scale height increasing with radius\nas $R^{0.75}$, and an electron density (derived from CO line ratios through\nNLTE analysis) in agreement with thermodynamical models.

The study of patterns\nin inversion sequences was initiated recently by Mansour-Shattuck and\nCorteel-Martinez-Savage-Weselcouch through a systematic study of inversion\nsequences avoiding words of length 3.

Recently a new line of research has emerged, dealing with\nnonlinear eigenfunctions induced by convex functionals.

However, the theory of nonlinear eigenvalue\nproblems is still at its infancy. We present a new flow that can generate\nnonlinear eigenfunctions of the form $T(u)=\\lambda u$, where $T(u)$ is a\nnonlinear operator and $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R} $ is the eigenvalue. We develop\nthe theory where $T(u)$ is a subgradient element of a regularizing\none-homogeneous functional, such as total-variation (TV) or\ntotal-generalized-variation (TGV).

This enables a deeper investigation into the space of\nnonlinear eigenfunctions, allowing to produce numerically diverse examples,\nwhich may be unknown yet. In addition we suggest an indicator to measure the\naffinity of a function to an eigenfunction and relate it to\npseudo-eigenfunctions in the linear case. \n\n"}

Both of\nthese criteria depend sensitively on whether and how perturbation modes of the\ninflaton interact and decohere. Decoherence is inevitable as a result of\ngravitationally-sourced interactions whose strength are proportional to the\nslow-roll parameters. However, the weakness of these interactions means that\ndecoherence is typically delayed until several Hubble times after modes grow\nbeyond the Hubble scale. We present perturbative evidence that decoherence of\nlong-wavelength inflaton modes indeed leads to an ensemble of classical\nspacetimes with differing cosmological evolutions. We introduce the notion of\nper-branch observables---expectation values with respect to the different\ndecohered branches of the wave function---and show that the evolution of modes\non individual branches varies from branch to branch.

In this work we generalize the classical\nBondi accretion theory to take into account the effects of the gravitational\npotential of the host galaxy, and of radiation pressure in the optically thin\nlimit. Then, we present the fully analytical solution, in terms of the\nLambert-Euler $W$-function, for isothermal accretion in Jaffe and Hernquist\ngalaxies with a central black hole. The flow structure is found to be sensitive\nto the shape of the mass profile of the host galaxy. These results and the\nformulae that are provided, mostly important the one for the critical accretion\nparameter, allow for a direct evaluation of all flow properties, and are then\nuseful for the above mentioned studies. As an application, we examine the\ndeparture from the true mass accretion rate of estimates obtained using the gas\nproperties at various distances from the black hole, under the hypothesis of\nclassical Bondi accretion. An overestimate is obtained from regions close to\nthe black hole, and an underestimate outside a few Bondi radii; the exact\nposition of the transition between the two kinds of departure depends on the\ngalaxy model. \n\n"}

This renders them incapable of reflecting and\npreserving important structure in many problems.

The key parameters that specify the SNR environment and\nthe interstellar CR transport are tightly constrained with the new measurements\nprovided by the AMS experiment on the B/C ratio and on the antiproton/proton\nratio. The best-fit models obtained from the two ratios are found to be\ninconsistent with each other, as the antiproton/proton data require enhanced\nsecondary production.

This paper\nproposes an approach to extracting personal knowledge from smartphone push\nnotifications, which are used by mobile systems and apps to inform users of a\nrich range of information. Our solution is based on the insight that most\nnotifications are formatted using templates, while knowledge entities can be\nusually found within the parameters to the templates. As defining all the\nnotification templates and their semantic rules are impractical due to the huge\nnumber of notification templates used by potentially millions of apps, we\npropose an automated approach for personal knowledge extraction from push\nnotifications. We first discover notification templates through pattern mining,\nthen use machine learning to understand the template semantics. Based on the\ntemplates and their semantics, we are able to translate notification text into\nknowledge facts automatically. Users' privacy is preserved as we only need to\nupload the templates to the server for model training, which do not contain any\npersonal information. According to our experiments with about 120 million push\nnotifications from 100,000 smartphone users, our system is able to extract\npersonal knowledge accurately and efficiently. \n\n"}

However, this might be sub-optimal in the presence\nof associated features. We introduce a new probabilistic preference model\ncalled feature-Bradley-Terry-Luce (f-BTL) model that generalizes the standard\nBTL model to incorporate feature information. We present a new least squares\nbased algorithm called fBTL-LS which we show requires much lesser than\n$O(n\\log(n))$ pairs to obtain a good ranking -- precisely our new sample\ncomplexity bound is of $O(\\alpha\\log \\alpha)$, where $\\alpha$ denotes the\nnumber of `independent items' of the set, in general $\\alpha << n$.

We consider this as an inherent limitation of L0 AEs, and thwart such\nattacks by both detecting and rectifying them. The main novelty of the proposed\ndetector is that we convert the AE detection problem into a comparison problem\nby exploiting the inherent limitation of L0 attacks.

The dispersion in the number of massive stars\nalso produces a dispersion in the properties of the corresponding ionising\nspectra. In this paper, we lay the bases for the future analysis of this effect\nby evaluating the dispersion in the ionising fluxes of synthetic spectra. As an\nimportant consequence, we found that the intensities of synthetic fluxes at\ndifferent ionisation edges are strongly correlated, a fact suggesting that no\nadditional dispersion will result from the inclusion of sampling effects in the\nanalysis of diagnostic diagrams; this is true for HII regions on all scales.\nAdditionally, we find convincing suggestions that the He II lines are strongly\naffected by sampling, and so cannot be used to constrain the evolutionary\nstatus of stellar clusters. We also establish the range of applicability of\nsynthesis models set by the Lowest Luminosity Limit for the ionising flux, that\nis the lowest limit in cluster mass for which synthesis models can be applied\nto predict ionising spectra. This limit marks the boundary between the\nsituations in which the ionising flux is better modeled with a single star as\nopposed to a star cluster; this boundary depends on the metallicity and age,\nranging from 10^3 to more than 10^6 Mo.

The observational effects, including peculiar velocity distortions in\nredshift space, light-cone effects, selection effects, and effects of the\ncomplex shape of the survey geometry, should be taken into account in the\nanalysis.

It has recently been suggested that, even in the presence of\nreasonable magnetic fields, thermal conduction in the ICM may be crucial for\nreproducing the temperature floor seen in many systems. If this is indeed\ncorrect, it raises the possibility that other transport processes may be\nimportant. With this motivation, we present a numerical investigation of the\nbuoyant evolution of AGN-blown cavities in ICM that has a non-negligible shear\nviscosity. We use the ZEUS-MP code to follow the 3-d evolution of an initially\nstatic, hot bubble in a beta-model ICM atmosphere with varying degrees of shear\nviscosity. With no explicit viscosity, it is found that the combined action of\nRayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities shred the ICM cavity and one\ndoes not reproduce the intact and detached ``ghost cavities'' observed in\nsystems such as Perseus-A. On the other hand, even a modest level of shear\nviscosity can be important in quenching the fluid instabilities and maintaining\nthe integrity of the bubble. In particular, we show that the morphology of the\nNW ghost cavity found in Perseus-A can be reproduced, as can the flow pattern\ninferred from the morphology of H-alpha filaments. Finally, we discuss the\npossible relevance of ICM viscosity to the fact that many of the active ICM\ncavities are not bounded by strong shocks. \n\n"}

This incorporates assumptions about the cosmological parameters,\nthe properties of primordial fluctuations, and the biasing relation between\ngalaxies and mass. These can be tested by comparing the reconstruction to the\nobserved galaxy distribution, and to peculiar velocity data. This paper\npresents a hybrid reconstruction method that combines the `Gaussianization''\ntechnique of Weinberg(1992) with the dynamical schemes of Nusser & Dekel(1992)\nand Gramann(1993). We test the method on N-body simulations and on N-body mock\ncatalogs that mimic the depth and geometry of the Point Source Catalog Redshift\nSurvey and the Optical Redshift Survey. This method is more accurate than\nGaussianization or dynamical reconstruction alone.

Contrarians\nare introduced within the context of the Minority Game (MG), which is a binary\nmodel for an evolving and adaptive population of agents competing for a limited\nresource.

The network is decomposed into its k-core\nstructure: particles in a core of index k have collided at least k times with\nother particles in the same core. The difference between cores k+1 and k is the\nso-called k-shell, and the set of all shells is a complete and on-overlapping\ndecomposition of the system. Because of energy dissipation, the gas cools down:\nits initial spatially homogeneous dynamics, characterized by the Haff law, i.e.\na t^{-2} energy decay, is unstable towards a strongly inhomogeneous phase with\nclusters and vortices, where energy decays as t^{-1}. The clear transition\nbetween those two phases appears in the evolution of the k-shells structure in\nthe collision network. In the homogeneous regime the k-shell structure evolves\nas in a growing network with fixed number of vertices and randomly added links:\nthe shell distribution is strongly peaked around the most populated shell,\nwhich has an index k_{max} ~ 0.9 <d> with <d> the average number of collisions\nexperienced by a particle.

Although the light\nscalar mesons $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ are widely perceived as primarily the\nfour-quark bound states, in practice it is difficult to make quantitative\npredictions based on the four-quark picture for light scalars. Hence,\npredictions are made in the 2-quark model for the scalar mesons. Based on the\nQCD sum rule method, we have derived the leading-twist light-cone distribution\namplitudes of scalar mesons and their decay constants. The short-distance\napproach suffices to explain the observed large rates of $f_0(980)K^-$ and\n$f_0(980)\\bar K^0$ that receive major penguin contributions from the $b\\to\nss\\bar s$ process. When $f_0(980)$ is assigned as a four-quark bound state,\nthere exist extra diagrams contributing to $B\\to f_0(980)K$. Therefore, a\npriori the $f_0(980)K$ rate is not necessarily suppressed for a four-quark\nstate $f_0(980)$.

It can be shown that all these relations express either the\nconditions of closure of exterior (skew-symmetric) differential forms and\ncorresponding dual forms or the properties of closed exterior forms.

We derived previously the optimal strategy for the\ncase of N non-orthogonal states, {|\\psi_{1} >, ..., |\\psi_{N} >}, for\ndistinguishing |\\psi_1 > from the set {|\\psi_2 >, ..., |\\psi_N >} and the\ncorresponding optimal success and failure probabilities. In a previous paper\n[PRL 90, 257901 (2003)], we sketched an appplication of the results to\nprobabilistic quantum algorithms. Here we fill in the gaps and give the\ncomplete derivation of the probabilstic quantum algorithm that can optimally\ndistinguish between two classes of Boolean functions, that of the balanced\nfunctions and that of the biased functions. The algorithm is probabilistic, it\nfails sometimes but when it does it lets us know that it did. Our approach can\nbe considered as a generalization of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm that was\ndeveloped for the discrimination of balanced and constant Boolean functions. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/0605014", "contents": "Title: Potential and limits to cluster state quantum computing using\n  probabilistic gates Abstract: We establish bounds to the necessary resource consumption when building up\ncluster states for one-way computing using probabilistic gates. Emphasis is put\non state preparation with linear optical gates, as the probabilistic character\nis unavoidable here. We identify rigorous general bounds to the necessary\nconsumption of initially available maximally entangled pairs when building up\none-dimensional cluster states with individually acting linear optical quantum\ngates, entangled pairs and vacuum modes. As the known linear optics gates have\na limited maximum success probability, as we show, this amounts to finding the\noptimal classical strategy of fusing pieces of linear cluster states. A formal\nnotion of classical configurations and strategies is introduced for\nprobabilistic non-faulty gates. We study the asymptotic performance of\nstrategies that can be simply described, and prove ultimate bounds to the\nperformance of the globally optimal strategy. The arguments employ methods of\nrandom walks and convex optimization. This optimal strategy is also the one\nthat requires the shortest storage time, and necessitates the fewest\ninvocations of probabilistic gates. For two-dimensional cluster states, we\nfind, for any elementary success probability, an essentially deterministic\npreparation of a cluster state with quadratic, hence optimal, asymptotic\nscaling in the use of entangled pairs. We also identify a percolation effect in\nstate preparation, in that from a threshold probability on, almost all\npreparations will be either successful or fail. We outline the implications on\nlinear optical architectures and fault-tolerant computations. \n\n"}

In contrast, EAQEC codes do not require the dual-containing condition,\nwhich greatly simplifies their construction. We show how any quaternary\nclassical code can be made into a EAQEC code. In particular, efficient modern\ncodes, like LDPC codes, which attain the Shannon capacity, can be made into\nEAQEC codes attaining the hashing bound. In a quantum computation setting,\nEAQEC codes give rise to catalytic quantum codes which maintain a region of\ninherited noiseless qubits.\n  We also give an alternative construction of EAQEC codes by making classical\nentanglement assisted codes coherent. \n\n"}
