The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter.

We find that it is not easy\nto reach the CDF central value of $B_s \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ decays when other decay\nchannels are considered. Our analysis also reveals that, for well-measured\ncharmless B decays into two final pseudoscalar mesons, the QCD factorization\npredictions with large annihilation parameters show good agreement with the\nexperimental data except $B_s \\to K^+ K^-$ and $B_d \\to K^0 \\bar{K}^0$ decays.\nThough other possibilities can not be excluded, this may indicate that the\nSU(3) flavor symmetry breaking should be taken into account for the\nannihilation topology.

Due to the strong correlation between\nthe Higgs decays to W+W- and to ga,ga predicted in the MSSM, the deficit of a\nW+W- final state signal would be in direct conflict with the ga,ga peak. If we\nconsider W+W- on its own, the absence of the W+W- signal would imply that the\nSM-like Higgs boson has reduced coupling to W+-, and that the other non-SM-like\nHiggs bosons should not be too heavy and do not decouple. If both the ga,ga\nexcess and the absence of W+W- continue, new physics beyond the MSSM will be\nrequired. A similar correlation exists between the W+W- and tau+tau- channels:\na reduced W+W- channel would force the tau+tau- channel to be larger. Future\nsearches for the SM-like Higgs boson at the LHC will provide critical tests for\nthe MSSM prediction. We emphasize the potential importance of the electroweak\nprocesses pp->H+H-, H+-A0, which are independent of the SUSY parameters except\nfor their masses.

For example, by using the conventional way of setting $\\mu_r \\in\n[m_t/2,2m_t]$, one obtains the total $t \\bar{t}$ production cross-section\n$\\sigma_{t \\bar{t}}$ with the uncertainty $\\Delta \\sigma_{t \\bar{t}}/\\sigma_{t\n\\bar{t}}\\sim ({}^{+3%}_{-4%})$ at the Tevatron and LHC even for the present\nNNLO level. The Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) eliminates the\nrenormalization scale ambiguity in precision tests of Abelian QED and\nnon-Abelian QCD theories. In this paper we apply PMC scale-setting to predict\nthe $t \\bar t$ cross-section $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ at the Tevatron and LHC\ncolliders. It is found that $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ remains almost unchanged by\nvarying $\\mu^{\\rm init}_r$ within the region of $[m_t/4,4m_t]$. The convergence\nof the expansion series is greatly improved. For the $(q\\bar{q})$-channel,\nwhich is dominant at the Tevatron, its NLO PMC scale is much smaller than the\ntop-quark mass in the small $x$-region, and thus its NLO cross-section is\nincreased by about a factor of two. In the case of the $(gg)$-channel, which is\ndominant at the LHC, its NLO PMC scale slightly increases with the subprocess\ncollision energy $\\sqrt{s}$, but it is still smaller than $m_t$ for\n$\\sqrt{s}\\lesssim 1$ TeV, and the resulting NLO cross-section is increased by\n$\\sim 20%$.

In this paper we\npropose a novel type of dark matter detector: detectors made of DNA or RNA\ncould provide nanometer resolution for tracking, an energy threshold of 0.5\nkeV, and can operate at room temperature. When a WIMP from the Galactic Halo\nelastically scatters off of a nucleus in the detector, the recoiling nucleus\nthen traverses hundreds of strings of single stranded nucleic acids (ssNA) with\nknown base sequences and severs ssNA strands along its trajectory. The location\nof the break can be identified by amplifying and identifying the segments of\ncut ssNA using techniques well known to biologists. Thus the path of the\nrecoiling nucleus can be tracked to nanometer accuracy. In one such detector\nconcept, the transducers are nanometer-thick Au-foils of 1m x 1m, and the\ndirection of recoiling nuclei is measured by \"NA Tracking Chamber\" consisting\nof ordered array of ssNA strands.

{"id": "1211.1026", "contents": "Title: Searching for the Origin of CP violation in Cabibbo Suppressed D-meson\n  Decays Abstract: The recent evidence of large direct CP violation in D0 decay at LHCb suggests\nthat such CP studies may become an important avenue for understanding CP. In\nthis paper, we make several suggestions to try to clarify the role of new\nphysics in these results. We propose that the enhancement needed in the\nStandard Model to attribute the observed CP violation in D to two pseudoscalar\nmodes may not operate for inclusive final states where asymmetries will likely\napproximate the quark level expectation. Experimentally testing this principle\nrequires a search for CP asymmetries in final states containing K and K-bar\nwith a total energy of less than M_D. We also propose that CP asymmetries may\nbe enhanced in modes where the tree is color suppressed. In particular, the\nfinal state rho0 rho0 is of special interest; similarly Ds-> rho0 K+ and rho0\nK*+ likewise appear interesting. We discuss how isospin symmetry yields\nobservables sensitive to certain classes of new physics and suppressed in the\nStandard Model. Some modes considered in this context are D-> pi pi, rho pi,\nrho rho as well as Ds-> K* pi. We also consider how such analysis may\neventually be supplemented by information about the weak phases in D0 decay. In\norder to obtain this information experimentally, we consider various methods\nfor preparing an initial state which is a quantum mechanical mixture of D0 and\nD0-bar. This may be done through the use of natural D0 D0-bar oscillations;\nobserving D0-mesons which arise from Bd or Bs mesons which themselves are\noscillating or from quantum correlations in D0 pairs which arise from either\npsi\" decay or B-meson decay. Observing CP violation in the magnitudes of decay\namplitudes should be within the capability of experiments in the near future\nhowever obtaining the weak phases through the methods we discuss will likely\nrequire future generations of machines. \n\n"}

Events are selected with two oppositely charged leptons (l = e, mu)\nand two jets identified as originating from b quarks. The analysis is based on\nthree kinematic observables whose distributions are sensitive to the value of\nM[t]. An invariant mass observable, M[bl], and a `stransverse mass' observable,\nM[T2], are employed in a simultaneous fit to determine the value of M[t] and an\noverall jet energy scale factor (JSF). A complementary approach is used to\nconstruct an invariant mass observable, M[blnu], that is combined with M[T2] to\nmeasure M[t].

Here, we introduce a model that is\nbased on the QCD theory of multi-parton interactions and that allows one to\nstudy interference effects in the production of $m$ particles in hadronic\ncollisions with $N$ parton-parton interactions (\"sources\"). In an expansion in\npowers of $1/(N_c^2-1)$ and to leading order in the number of sources $N$, we\ncalculate interference effects in the $m$-particle spectra and we determine\nfrom them the second and fourth order cumulant momentum anisotropies $v_n$.\nWithout invoking any azimuthal asymmetry and any density dependent non-linear\ndynamics in the incoming state, and without invoking any interaction in the\nfinal state, we find that QCD interference alone can give rise to values for\n$v_n\\lbrace 2\\rbrace$ and $v_n\\lbrace 4\\rbrace$, $n$ even, that persist\nunattenuated for increasing number of sources, that may increase with\nincreasing multiplicity and that agree with measurements in proton-proton (pp)\ncollisions in terms of the order of magnitude of the signal and the approximate\nshape of the transverse momentum dependence.

This documentation refers to the first main version\nrelease, which will form the basis for continued developments, consequently it\nonly implements the key features of those we plan to ultimately include. This\narticle acts as a manual for the program; describing in detail its use,\nstructure, validation and results; whilst also highlighting key aspects of the\nresummation formalism applied. It details the two classes of processes so far\nincluded; these are diphoton production and Drell-Yan production.\n  A main concept behind the development of the tool is that it is a hands-on\nwhite box for the user: significant effort has been made to give the program a\nmodular structure, making the various parts which comprise it independent of\neach other as much as possible and ensuring they are transparently documented,\ncustomizable and, in principle, replaceable with something that may better\nserve the users needs.\n  reSolve is a new C++ program, based on an evolution of the private Fortran\ncode 2gres, previously used for the calculations in refs.

This initial\nversion calculates the low transverse momentum contribution to the fully\ndifferential cross-section for two main categories of processes; the inclusive\nproduction of two photons, and inclusive Drell-Yan production. In all cases\nresummation up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Logarithm (NNLL) is included. We aim\nto extend the program to several more processes in the near future.

In order for decaying DM to\nbe a dominant source of the IceCube high-energy neutrinos, it would require an\nunusually suppressed value of the coupling of DM to neutrinos. We attempt to\nexplain this small coupling in the context of an $R$-parity conserving minimal\nsupergravity model which has right-handed neutrino superfields. With the main\nassumptions of super-partner masses at the PeV scale and also a reheating\ntemperature not much larger than the PeV scale, we find in our model several\nnatural order-of-magnitude \"miracles\", (i) the gravitino is produced via\nfreeze-in as a DM candidate with the correct relic density (ii) the\nright-handed (RH) sneutrino makes up only a tiny fraction ($10^{-6})$, of the\npresent day energy density of the universe, yet its decay lifetime to the\ngravitino and neutrinos is such that it naturally predicts the right\norder-of-magnitude for the IceCube neutrino flux.

They are the S3, U3 and U1 leptoquarks (LQs), and a triplet of\nSM-like vector bosons (VBs). Under the theoretical assumption that the NP\ncouples predominantly to the third generation, previous analyses found that,\nwhen constraints from other processes are taken into account, the S3, U3 and VB\nmodels cannot explain the B anomalies, but U1 is viable. In this paper, we\nreanalyze these models, but without any assumption about their couplings. We\nfind that, even in this most general case, S3 and U3 are excluded.

Because of the LFV constraints, the pattern of couplings of the U1\nLQ is similar to that obtained with the above theoretical assumption. Also, the\nLFV constraints render unimportant those constraints obtained using the\nrenormalization group equations. As for the VB model, it is excluded if the\nabove theoretical assumption is made due to the additional constraints from\n$B^0_s$-${\\bar B}^0_s$ mixing, $\\tau\\to 3\\mu$ and $\\tau \\to \\mu \\nu {\\bar\\nu}$.\nBy contrast, we find a different set of NP couplings that both explains the $b\n\\to s \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ anomaly and is compatible with all constraints.

Abstract: Many studies of possible new physics employ effective field theory (EFT),\nwhereby corrections to the Standard Model take the form of higher-dimensional\noperators, suppressed by a large energy scale. Fits of such a theory to data\ntypically use parton level observables, which limits the datasets one can use.\nIn order to theoretically model search channels involving many additional jets,\nit is important to include tree-level matrix elements matched to a parton\nshower algorithm, and a suitable matching procedure to remove the double\ncounting of additional radiation. There are then two potential problems: (i)\nEFT corrections are absent in the shower, leading to an extra source of\ndiscontinuities in the matching procedure; (ii) the uncertainty in the matching\nprocedure may be such that no additional constraints are obtained from\nobservables sensitive to radiation. In this paper, we review why the first of\nthese is not a problem in practice, and perform a detailed study of the second.\nIn particular, we quantify the additional constraints on EFT expected from top\npair plus multijet events, relative to inclusive top pair production alone. \n\n"}

Abstract: A narrow line shape peak at about 10615 MeV, just above the threshold in the\n$B\\bar B^*$ channel, which can be regarded as the signal of bottomonium\ncounterpart of $X(3872)$, $X_b$, is predicted by using the extended Friedrichs\nscheme. Though a virtual state is found at about 10593 MeV in this scheme, we\npoint out that the peak is contributed mainly by the coupling form factor,\nwhich comes from the convolution of the interaction term and meson wave\nfunctions including the one from $\\chi_{b1}(4P)$, but not mainly by the\nvirtual-state pole. In this picture, the reason why $X_b$ signal is not\nobserved in the $\\Upsilon\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\Upsilon\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$ channels can\nalso be understood. The $\\chi_{b1}(4P)$ mass and width are found to be about\n10771 MeV and 6 MeV, respectively and a dynamically generated broad resonance\nis also found with its mass and width at about 10672 MeV and 78 MeV,\nrespectively.

The main beam-induced background impacting CLIC\nphysics analyses is produced by beamstrahlung radiation from the electron and\npositron bunches traversing the high field of the opposite beam and converting\nto hadrons. The timing selections are a powerful tool to discriminate signal\nfrom background events at CLIC.

From the $D_s$ decay, we obtain masses and widths of\n$f_0(980)$ and $f_0(1370)$. We find evidence for a light and broad scalar\nresonance, the $\\sigma$ meson, in $D^+\\to\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$ decay.

The linearly\npolarised photon beam is produced from coherent bremsstrahlung radiation by 178\nGeV unpolarised electrons incident on an aligned Si crystal, acting as a\nradiator. The linear polarisation of the photon beam is characterised by\nmeasuring the asymmetry in electron-positron pair production in a Ge crystal,\nfor different crystal orientations. The Ge crystal therefore acts as an\nanalyser. The birefringence phenomenon, which converts the linear polarisation\nto circular polarisation, is observed by letting the linearly polarised photons\nbeam pass through a thick Si quarter wave plate crystal, and then measuring the\nasymmetry in electron-positron pair production again for a selection of\nrelative angles between the crystallographic planes of the radiator, analyser\nand quarter wave plate.

In the\nleptonic channel, 5 events are found while 1.31 \\pm 0.22 events are expected\nfrom the Standard Model background. In the hadronic channel, no excess above\nthe expectation for Standard Model processes is found.

The assumption made at the Tevatron is that the spectator parton\ninteraction energy is similar to the ambient level measured in minimum bias\nevents. In this paper, we test this assumption by measuring the ambient charged\ntrack momentum in events containing large transverse energy jets at\n$\\sqrt{s}=1800$ GeV and $\\sqrt{s}=630$ GeV and comparing this ambient momentum\nwith that observed both in minimum bias events and with that predicted by two\nMonte Carlo models.

The fluctuations and correlations are analysed in terms of the\nnormalized scaled factorial moments and cumulants up to the fifth order.

The decomposition\nof the factorial moments into lower-order correlations shows that the dynamical\nfluctuations have important contributions from genuine many-particle\ncorrelations.

We find that\nwhile the string melting scenario, in which hadrons that are expected to be\nformed from initial strings are converted to their valence quarks and\nantiquarks, can explain the measured $p_{T}$-dependence of $v_{2}$ and $ v_{4}\n$ of charged hadrons at midrapidity with a parton scattering cross section of\nabout 10 \\textrm{mb}, the scenario without string melting reproduces better the\nrecent data on $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ of charged hadrons at large pseudorapidity\nin Au + Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=200$ AGeV . Our results thus suggest that a\npartonic matter is formed during early stage of relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions only around midrapidity and that strings remain dominant at large\nrapidities. The $p_{T}$-dependence of $v_{1} $, $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$\nfor charged hadrons at forward pseudorapidity is also predicted, and we find\nthat while $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are appreciable at large pseudorapidity the\nhigher-order anisotropic flows $v_{3}$ and $v_{4} $ are essentially zero. \n\n"}

Abstract: Knowing whether a hadron is formed inside or outside the nuclear medium is\nvery important for correctly interpreting jet quenching in heavy-ion\ncollisions. The cleanest experimental environment to study the space-time\nevolution of hadronization is semi-inclusive DIS on nuclear targets. Two\nframeworks are presently competing to explain the observed attenuation of\nhadron production: quark energy loss, with hadron formation outside the\nnucleus, and nuclear absorption with hadronization starting inside the nucleus.\nI demonstrate that the observed approximate A^(2/3) scaling of experimental\ndata cannot conclusively establish the correctness of either energy loss or\nabsorption. \n\n"}
