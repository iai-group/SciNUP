Convection and the advective-acoustic cycle in the supernova\n  core Abstract: By 2D hydrodynamic simulations including a detailed equation of state and\nneutrino transport, we investigate the interplay between different non-radial\nhydrodynamic instabilities that play a role during the postbounce accretion\nphase of collapsing stellar cores. The convective mode of instability, which is\ndriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by time\nvariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the development\nof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in the\npostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth of\nsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shocked\nflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growth\nof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shock\ninstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can trigger\nconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of the\naverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamic\ninstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through the\nneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition in\nsupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting and\nmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because the\naccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of the\nSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and a\nvariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for the\nadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by the\naccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close an\namplifying global feedback loop.

If these particles make up the dark\nmatter, then they can be captured by the Sun or the Earth, sink to the\nrespective cores, annihilate, and produce neutrinos. Thus, these neutrinos can\nbe a striking dark matter signature at neutrino telescopes looking towards the\nSun and/or the Earth. Here, we improve previous analyses on computing the\nneutrino yields from WIMP annihilations in several respects. We include\nneutrino oscillations in a full three-flavor framework as well as all effects\nfrom neutrino interactions on the way through the Sun (absorption, energy loss,\nand regeneration from tau decays).

It is based on a microscopic model for pion production\noff the nucleon that, besides the dominant Delta pole contribution, takes into\naccount the effect of background terms required by chiral symmetry. Moreover,\nthe model uses a reduced nucleon-to-Delta resonance axial coupling, which leads\nto coherent pion production cross sections around a factor two smaller than\nmost of the previous theoretical estimates. In the coherent production, the\nmain nuclear effects, namely medium corrections on the Delta propagator and the\nfinal pion distortion, are included. We have improved on previous similar\nmodels by taking into account the nucleon motion and employing a more\nsophisticated optical potential. As found in previous calculations the\nmodification of the Delta self-energy inside the nuclear medium strongly\nreduces the cross section, while the final pion distortion mainly shifts the\npeak position to lower pion energies. The angular distribution profiles are not\nmuch affected by nuclear effects. Nucleon motion increases the cross section by\n15% at neutrino energies of 650 MeV, while Coulomb effects on charged pions are\nestimated to be small. Finally, we discuss at length the deficiencies of the\nRein-Sehgal pion coherent production model for neutrino energies below 2 GeV,\nand in particular for the MiniBooNE and T2K experiments.

Two main schemes have been\nproposed for such a 'first' detection: measurements of ellipticity acquired by\na linearly polarized beam of light passing through a magnetic field and direct\nlight-light scattering. The study of the propagation of light through an\nexternal field can also be used to probe for new physics such as the existence\nof axion-like particles and millicharged particles. Their existence in nature\nwould cause the index of refraction of vacuum to be different from unity in the\npresence of an external field and dependent of the polarization direction of\nthe light propagating. The major achievement of reaching the project\nsensitivities in gravitational wave interferometers such as LIGO an VIRGO has\nopened the possibility of using such instruments for the detection of QED\ncorrections in electrodynamics and for probing new physics at very low\nenergies.

It has been considered that the\nLambda(1405) resonance is generated by the attractive interaction of the\nantikaon and the nucleon, as a quasi-bound state below the threshold decaying\ninto the pi Sigma channel. Thus, the structure of Lambda(1405) is closely\nrelated to the Kbar N interaction which is the fundamental ingredient to study\nfew-body systems with antikaon. In this paper, after reviewing the basic\nproperties of the Lambda(1405) resonance, we introduce the dynamical\ncoupled-channel model which respects chiral symmetry of QCD and the unitarity\nof the scattering amplitude. We show that the structure of the Lambda(1405)\nresonance is dominated by the meson-baryon molecule component and is described\nas a superposition of two independent states. The meson-baryon nature of\nLambda(1405) leads to various hadronic molecule states in few-body systems with\nstrangeness which are hadron composite systems driven by the hadronic\ninteractions.

Using new published\nnon-rotating and rotating stellar tracks, we study the integrated properties of\nsynthetic stellar populations and find that the UV to SFR calibration for the\nrotating stellar population is 30% smaller than for the non-rotating stellar\npopulation, and 40% smaller for the Halpha to SFR calibration. These reductions\ntranslate to smaller SFR estimates made from observed UV and Halpha\nluminosities. Using the UV and Halpha fluxes of a sample of ~300 local\ngalaxies, we derive a total (i.e., sky-coverage corrected) SFR within 11 Mpc of\n120-170 Msun/yr and 80-130 Msun/yr for the non-rotating and rotating\nestimators, respectively. Independently, the number of core-collapse supernovae\ndiscovered in the same volume requires a total SFR of 270^{+110}_{-80} Msun/yr,\nsuggesting a mild tension with the SFR estimates made with rotating\ncalibrations. More generally, when compared with the estimated SFR, the local\nsupernova discoveries strongly constrain any physical effects that might\nincrease the energy output of massive stars, including, but not limited to,\nstellar rotation. The cosmic SFR and cosmic supernova rate data on the other\nhand show the opposite trend, with the cosmic SFR almost double that inferred\nfrom cosmic supernovae, constraining a significant decrease in the energy\noutput of massive stars. Together, these lines of evidence suggest that the\ntrue SFR calibration factors cannot be too far from their canonical values. \n\n"}

These stable particles are typically a\nsubdominant DM component, but because they are produced with a large Lorentz\nboost in this process, they can be detected in large volume terrestrial\nexperiments via neutral-current-like interactions with electrons or nuclei.\nThis novel DM signal thus combines the production mechanism associated with\nindirect detection experiments (i.e. galactic DM annihilation) with the\ndetection mechanism associated with direct detection experiments (i.e. DM\nscattering off terrestrial targets). Such processes are generically present in\nmulti-component DM scenarios or those with non-minimal DM stabilization\nsymmetries. As a proof of concept, we present a model of two-component thermal\nrelic DM, where the dominant heavy DM species has no tree-level interactions\nwith the standard model and thus largely evades direct and indirect DM bounds.\nInstead, its thermal relic abundance is set by annihilation into a subdominant\nlighter DM species, and the latter can be detected in the boosted channel via\nthe same annihilation process occurring today.

This progress is largely facilitated by the new\ngeneration of experiments in deuteron electrodisintegration carried out at\nunprecedentedly high momentum transfer. The theoretical analysis of these data\nconfirms the onset of the high energy eikonal regime in the scattering process\nwhich allows one to separate long range nuclear effects from the effects\ngenuinely related to the short distance structure of the deuteron. Our\nconclusion is that for the first time the deuteron is probed at relative\nmomenta beyond 300 MeV/c without dominating long range effects. As a result, at\nthese large nucleon momenta the cross section is sensitive to the nuclear\ndynamics at sub-fermi distances. Due to large internal momenta involved we are\ndealing with the relativistic bound state that is best described by the\nlight-cone momentum distribution of nucleons in the deuteron.

Specifically, we consider a scenario where a $\\sim 4$ PeV scalar\ndark matter particle $\\phi$ can decay to a much lighter dark fermion $\\chi$,\nwhich in turn scatters off nuclei in the IceCube detector.

From these considerations it follows that one is unable to prove,\nespecially model-independently,a discovery of a DM particle with an\naccelerator, or collider.

By detecting reactor antineutrinos from two power plants\nat 53-km distance, JUNO will determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at a 3-4\nsigma significance with six years of running. The measurement of antineutrino\nspectrum will also lead to the precise determination of three out of the six\noscillation parameters to an accuracy of better than 1\\%. Neutrino burst from a\ntypical core-collapse supernova at 10 kpc would lead to ~5000\ninverse-beta-decay events and ~2000 all-flavor neutrino-proton elastic\nscattering events in JUNO. Detection of DSNB would provide valuable information\non the cosmic star-formation rate and the average core-collapsed neutrino\nenergy spectrum. Geo-neutrinos can be detected in JUNO with a rate of ~400\nevents per year, significantly improving the statistics of existing geoneutrino\nsamples. The JUNO detector is sensitive to several exotic searches, e.g. proton\ndecay via the $p\\to K^++\\bar\\nu$ decay channel. The JUNO detector will provide\na unique facility to address many outstanding crucial questions in particle and\nastrophysics.

In addition to publishing a 95% C.L. exclusion limit, the full\nlikelihood information for the narrow resonance model has been released.

We\npresent a simple algorithm that maps an arbitrary model with multiple neutral\nHiggs bosons onto the narrow resonance model and derives the corresponding\nvalue for the exclusion likelihood from the CMS search.

Due to their role neutrinos carry information from the heart of\nthe explosion and, due to their weakly interacting nature, offer the only\ndirect probe of the dynamics and thermodynamics at the center of a supernova.\nIn this paper, we review the present status of modelling the neutrino physics\nand signal formation in collapsing and exploding stars. We assess the\ncapability of current and planned large underground neutrino detectors to yield\nfaithful information of the time and flavor dependent neutrino signal from a\nfuture Galactic supernova.

In Super-Kamiokande, these beta decays\nare the dominant background in 6--18 MeV, relevant for solar neutrinos and the\ndiffuse supernova neutrino background. In a previous paper, we showed that\nthese spallation isotopes are produced primarily in showers, instead of in\nisolation.

A central part of the Higgs programme at an e+e- collider\nis the model-independent determination of the absolute Higgs couplings to\nfermions and to gauge bosons. Here the measurement of the e+e-->HZ\nHiggsstrahlung cross section, using the recoil mass technique, sets the\nabsolute scale for all Higgs coupling measurements. Previous studies have\nconsidered e+e- ->ZH with Z->l+l-, where l = electron or muon. In this paper it\nis shown for the first time that a near model-independent recoil mass technique\ncan be extended to the hadronic decays of the Z boson. Because the branching\nratio for Z->qq is approximately ten times greater than for Z->l+l-, this\nmethod is statistically more powerful than using the leptonic decays.

Lepton mixing may be\nregarded as a deviation from tri-bimaximal mixing, with charged lepton\ncorrections leading to solar mixing sum rules, or tri-maximal lepton mixing\nleading to atmospheric mixing rules. We survey neutrino mass models, using a\nroadmap based on the open questions in neutrino physics. We then focus on the\nseesaw mechanism with right-handed neutrinos, where sequential dominance (SD)\ncan account for large lepton mixing angles and CP violation, with precise\npredictions emerging from constrained SD (CSD).

Stability of new fermion or scalar multiplets is\nensured by an accidental matter parity that survives the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of the gauge group by scalar triplets. The relic abundance of these\nparticles is set by gauge interactions and gives rise to dark matter candidates\nwith masses above the electroweak scale. Dark matter annihilations are thus\nmodified by the Sommerfeld effect, not only in the early Universe, but also\ntoday, for instance, in the Center of the Galaxy. Majorana candidates -\ntriplet, quintuplet, bi-doublet, and bi-triplet - bring only one new parameter\nto the model, their mass, and are hence highly testable at colliders and\nthrough astrophysical observations. Scalar candidates - doublet and 7-plet, the\nlatter being only stable at the renormalizable level - have additional\nscalar-scalar interactions that give rise to rich phenomenology. The particles\nunder discussion share many features with the well-known candidates wino,\nHiggsino, inert doublet scalar, sneutrino, and Minimal Dark Matter.

The interpretation of the excess as a spin-zero s-channel\nresonance implies model-independent lower bounds on both its branching ratio\nand its coupling to photons, which stringently constrain dynamical models. We\nconsider both the case where the excess is described by a narrow and a broad\nresonance. We also obtain model-independent constraints on the allowed\ncouplings and branching fractions to final states other than diphotons, by\nincluding the interplay with 8 TeV searches. These results can guide attempts\nto construct viable dynamical models of the resonance. Turning to specific\nmodels, our findings suggest that the anomaly cannot be accounted for by the\npresence of only an additional singlet or doublet spin-zero field and the\nStandard Model degrees of freedom; this includes all two-Higgs-doublet models.\nLikewise, heavy scalars in the MSSM cannot explain the excess if stability of\nthe electroweak vacuum is required, at least in a leading-order analysis.

However, we provide an existence proof in the form\nof a model with vectorlike quarks with large electric charge that is\nperturbative up to the 100 TeV scale.

In this paper we discuss\nthe sensitivity of the T2HKK experiment, whose possibility is now seriously\ndiscussed as a future extension of the T2K experiment, to such NSI.

Such events would be\nobservationally indistinguishable from neutral current deep-inelastic\nscattering events due to neutrinos. Consequently, one reason for deviations,\nbreaks or excesses in the expected astrophysical power-law neutrino spectrum\ncould be the flux of such a particle. Motivated by features in the recent\n1347-day IceCube high energy starting event data (HESE), we focus on particular\nboosted dark matter ($\\chi$) related realizations of this premise. Here, $\\chi$\nis assumed to be much lighter than, and the result of, the slow decay of a\nmassive scalar ($\\phi$) which constitutes a major fraction of the Universe's\ndark matter. We show that this hypothesis, coupled with a standard power-law\nastrophysical neutrino flux is capable of providing very good fits to the\npresent data, along with a possible explanation of other features in the HESE\nsample. These features include a) the paucity of events beyond $\\sim 2$ PeV b)\na spectral feature resembling a dip or a spectral change in the 400 TeV--1 PeV\nregion and c) an excess in the $50-100$ TeV region.

Specifically, the $q\\bar q$ quark model has difficulties in\nunderstanding the light scalar mesons below 1 GeV, scalar and axial-vector\ncharmed mesons and $1^+$ charmonium-like state $X(3872)$. A common wisdom for\nthe resolution of these difficulties lies on the coupled channel effects which\nwill distort the quark model calculations. In this work, we focus on the near\nmass degeneracy of scalar charmed mesons, $D_{s0}^*$ and $D_0^{*0}$, and its\nimplications. Within the framework of heavy meson chiral perturbation theory,\nwe show that near degeneracy can be qualitatively understood as a consequence\nof self-energy effects due to strong coupled channels. Quantitatively, the\ncloseness of $D_{s0}^*$ and $D_0^{*0}$ masses can be implemented by adjusting\ntwo relevant strong couplings and the renormalization scale appearing in the\nloop diagram. Then this in turn implies the mass similarity of $B_{s0}^*$ and\n$B_0^{*0}$ mesons. The $P_0^* P'_1$ interaction with the Goldstone boson is\ncrucial for understanding the phenomenon of near degeneracy. Based on heavy\nquark symmetry in conjunction with corrections from QCD and $1/m_Q$ effects, we\nobtain the masses of $B^*_{(s)0}$ and $B'_{(s)1}$ mesons, for example,\n$M_{B_{s0}^*}= (5715\\pm1)\\,{\\rm MeV}+\\delta\\Delta_S$,\n$M_{B'_{s1}}=(5763\\pm1)\\,{\\rm MeV}+\\delta\\Delta_S$ with $\\delta\\Delta_S$ being\n$1/m_Q$ corrections.

The\ndetection of even a single neutrino can pin down the energy scale of thermal\nneutrino emission from binary-neutron-star mergers and could strongly support\nor disfavor formation of remnant massive neutron stars.

The systematic error associated with the simplest truncation has been\nquantified, and it underpins a one-parameter model efficacious in describing an\nextensive body of mesonic phenomena. Incipient applications to baryons have\nbrought successes and encountered challenges familiar from early studies of\nmesons, and promise a covariant field theory upon which to base an\nunderstanding of contemporary large momentum transfer data. \n\n"}

{"id": "nucl-th/9903029", "contents": "Title: Signatures of Disoriented Chiral Condensates from Charged Pions Abstract: We show that the variance in the number of charged pions (in a suitable range\nof momentum space) provides a signature for the observation of a disoriented\nchiral condensate (D$\\chi$C). The signal should be observable even if multiple\ndomains of D$\\chi$C form provided the average number of pions per domain is\nsignificantly large than unity. The variance of the number charged pions alone\nprovides a signal which can be used even if the number of neutral pions cannot\nbe measured in a given detector. If the neutrals can be measured, however, the\nfluctuations in the total number of pions provides a signature which\ndistinguishes disoriented chiral condensates from other hypothetical sources of\ncoherent states of pions. \n\n"}

First, 10 crystals were irradiated simultaneously over 30 hours\nby a narrow beam, so that only a small region of each crystal was affected. We\nstudied the effect of the irradiation on the light output non-uniformity. If a\nlocalized degradation was observed, it would indicate damage to the\nscintillation mechanism. Secondly, we detected light output using two\nphototubes attached to sides of a crystal. Since these phototubes detect\nscintillation light only from a small localized region, the effect of\ntransmission loss should be minimal. We did not see any statistically\nsignificant evidence for scintillation mechanism damage with either method. The\neffect is consistent with zero, and the upper limit is 0.5% at 95% C.L. \n\n"}
