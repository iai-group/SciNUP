These external radiation fields control the amount\nof the inverse Compton radiation with respect to the synchrotron flux.\nTherefore the predicted spectral energy distribution (SED) will depend on where\nthe jet dissipates part of its energy to produce the observed radiation.

This is more so for large black hole masses.

Thanks to the broad bandpass coupled with\nhigh-sensitivity of Suzaku, we measured the evolution of the spectrum over the\n0.4--60 keV band in data segments as short as ~1 ksec. The data show deviations\nfrom a simple power law model, but also a clear spectral variability. The\ntime-resolved spectra are fitted by a synchrotron model, where the observed\nspectrum is due to a exponentially cutoff power law distribution of electrons\nradiating in uniform magnetic field; this model is preferred over a broken\npower law. As another scenario, we separate the spectrum into \"steady\" and\n\"variable\" components by subtracting the spectrum in the lowest-flux period\nfrom those of other data segments.

In contrast, this ratio should decrease according to the standard\nscenario, in which CR positrons are secondaries formed by hadronic interactions\nbetween the primary CR protons and the interstellar medium (ISM). The positron\nexcess is therefore interpreted as evidence for either an annihilation/decay of\nweakly interacting massive particles, or for a direct astrophysical source of\npairs. The common feature of all proposed models is that they invoke new\nphysics or new astrophysical sources. However, this line of argumentation\nrelies implicitly on the assumption of a relatively homogeneous CR source\ndistribution. Inhomogeneity of CR sources on a scale of order a kpc, can\nnaturally explain this anomaly. If the nearest major CR source is about a kpc\naway, then low energy electrons (~GeV) can easily reach us. At higher energies\n(> 10 GeV), the source electrons cool via synchrotron and inverse-Compton\nbefore reaching the solar vicinity. Pairs formed in the local vicinity through\nthe proton/ISM interactions can reach the solar system also at high energies,\nthus increasing the positron/electron ratio. A natural origin of source\ninhomogeneity is the strong concentration of supernovae to the galactic spiral\narms. Assuming supernova remnants (SNRs) as the sole primary source of CRs, and\ntaking into account their concentration near the galactic spiral arms, we\nconsistently predict the observed positron fraction between 1 and 100 GeV,\nwhile abiding to different constraints such as the observed electron spectrum\nand the CRs cosmogenic age. An ATIC like spectral excess at ~600 GeV can be\nexplained, in this picture, as the contribution of a few known nearby SNRs. \n\n"}

In our approach, we evolve the canonical\nmomentum and the canonical energy per baryon and thus circumvent some of the\nproblems that have plagued earlier formulations of relativistic SPH. We further\nuse a much improved artificial viscosity prescription which uses the extreme\nlocal eigenvalues of the Euler equations and triggers selectively on a) shocks\nand b) velocity noise. The shock trigger accurately monitors the relative\ndensity slope and uses it to fine-tune the amount of artificial viscosity that\nis applied. This procedure substantially sharpens shock fronts while still\navoiding post-shock noise. If not triggered, the viscosity parameter of each\nparticle decays to zero. None of these viscosity triggers is specific to\nspecial relativity, both could also be applied in Newtonian SPH. The\nperformance of the new scheme is explored in a large variety of benchmark tests\nwhere it delivers excellent results. Generally, the grad-h terms deliver minor,\nthough worthwhile, improvements.

The\ngamma-ray profile occupies 1/3 of pulse phase and has three closely-spaced\npeaks with the first peak lagging the radio pulse by delta=0.29P. We have also\nidentified a soft Swift source that is the likely X-ray counterpart. In many\nrespects PSR J1741-2054 resembles the Geminga pulsar. The second source, PSR\nJ2032+4127, was detected at the GBT.

Most of them reach a peak flux of\n~15 Crab, but a few only reach a peak flux below a Crab. One of the bursts\nshows a very strong photospheric radius-expansion phase. This allows us to\nevaluate the distance to the source: 3.2 kpc. The burst durations are between\n10 sec to 5 min. However, after one of the intermediate-duration bursts, a\nfaint tail is seen to at least ~2.4 hours after the start of the burst. One\nvery long burst lasted for several hours. This superburst candidate was\nfollowed by a normal type-I burst only 19 days later. This is, to our\nknowledge, the shortest burst-quench time among the superbursters. A superburst\nin this system is difficult to reconcile if it accretes at ~1% L_Edd.

A rising phase is likely present in all GRBs but is usually hidden\nby the prompt tail emission and constitutes the first manifestation of what is\nlater to give rise to the shallow decay phase. Contemporaneous optical\nobservations reveal a rapid evolution of the injection frequency of a fast\ncooling synchrotron spectrum through the optical band, which disfavours the\nafterglow onset (start of the forward shock emission along our line of sight\nwhen the outflow is decelerated) as the origin of the observed re-brightening.\nWe investigate alternative scenarios and find that the observations are\nconsistent with the predictions for a narrow jet viewed off-axis.

We then arranged a set of reference objects mimicking\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the local universe, with which correlations of\nsimulated UHECR events are analyzed. With our model IGMF, the deflection angle\nbetween the arrival direction of super-GZK protons and the sky position of\ntheir actual sources is quite large with the mean value of $<\\theta > \\sim\n15^{\\circ}$ and the median value of $\\tilde \\theta \\sim 7 - 10^{\\circ}$.

The prompt\ndetection, both from space and ground-based telescopes, of a bright optical\ncounterpart to this GRB offered a unique opportunity to complete a detailed\nstudy. Methods. Based on an extensive ground-based observational campaign, we\nobtained the spectrum of the optical afterglow of GRB090426, measuring its\nredshift and obtaining information about the medium in which the event took\nplace. We completed follow-up observation of the afterglow optical light curve\ndown to the brightness level of the host galaxy that we firmly identified and\nstudied.

The\nmagnetopause is a strong shear layer with rapid changes in the azimuthal\nvelocity, the density, and the magnetic field over a short radial distance and\nthus the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability may be important. The plasma\ndynamics is treated using non-relativistic, compressible (isentropic)\nmagnetohydrodynamics. It is necessary to include the displacement current in\norder that plasma wave velocities remain less than the speed of light. We focus\nmainly on the case of a star with an aligned dipole magnetic field so that the\nmagnetic field is axial in the disc midplane and perpendicular to the disc flow\nvelocity. However, we also give results for cases where the magnetic field is\nat an arbitrary angle to the flow velocity. For the aligned dipole case the\nmagnetopause is most unstable for KH waves propagating in the azimuthal\ndirection perpendicular to the magnetic field which tends to stabilize waves\npropagating parallel to it. The wave phase velocity is that of the disc matter.\nA quasi-linear theory of the saturation of the instability leads to a\nwavenumber ($k$) power spectrum $\\propto k^{-1}$ of the density and temperature\nfluctuations of the magnetopause, and it gives the mass accretion and angular\nmomentum inflow rates across the magnetopause.

If confirmed, this will\nbe by far the highest frequency feature observed from an accreting neutron star\nsystem, and hence could be very useful to understand such systems. This\nplausible timing feature was observed simultaneously with lower (~ 585 Hz) and\nupper (~ 904 Hz) kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations. The two kilohertz\nquasi-periodic oscillation frequencies had the ratio of ~ 1.5, and the\nfrequency of the alleged ~ 1860 Hz feature was close to the triple and the\ndouble of these frequencies.

However, recent numerical simulations suggested\nthat the transition to this regime is accompanied by a sudden \"burst\" of\nacceleration. We confirm this finding and attribute the acceleration to the\nsideways expansion of the jet - the magnetic energy is converted into the\nkinetic one in the strong magnetosonic rarefaction wave, which is launched when\nthe jet loses its external support. This type of acceleration, the rarefaction\nacceleration, is specific to relativistic jets because their energy budget can\nstill be dominated by magnetic energy even in highly super-fast magnetosonic\nregime. Just like the collimation acceleration of externally confined\nmagnetized jets, it is connected with the geometry of magnetic flux sufaces. In\nboth cases, in the acceleration zone the poloidal field lines diverge faster\nthan in the monopolar configuration. On the other hand, whereas the collimation\nacceleration keeps the product of jet opening angle and Lorentz factor somewhat\nbelow unity, the rarefaction acceleration allows to make it significantly\nlarger, in agreement with the standard model of jet breaks in afterglow light\ncurves. \n\n"}

The physical self-force along the orbit is then\nobtained via mode-sum regularization. The total self-force contains a\ndissipative piece as well as a conservative piece, and we describe a simple\nmethod for disentangling these two pieces in a time-domain framework. The\ndissipative component is responsible for the loss of orbital energy and angular\nmomentum through gravitational radiation; as a test of our code we demonstrate\nthat the work done by the dissipative component of the computed force is\nprecisely balanced by the asymptotic fluxes of energy and angular momentum,\nwhich we extract independently from the wave-zone numerical solutions. The\nconservative piece of the self force does not affect the time-averaged rate of\nenergy and angular-momentum loss, but it influences the evolution of the\norbital phases; this piece is calculated here for the first time in eccentric\nstrong-field orbits. As a first concrete application of our code we recently\nreported the value of the shift in the location and frequency of the innermost\nstable circular orbit due to the conservative self-force [Phys.

Much of the analysis relates to the 'high energy' cosmic\nrays ($E>10^{14}eV;=0.1PeV$) and their variability due to the changing\nproximity of the solar system to supernova remnants which are generally\nbelieved to be responsible for most cosmic rays up to PeV energies. It is\npointed out that, on a statistical basis, there will have been considerable\nvariations in the likely 100 My between the Earth's biosphere reaching\nreasonable stability and the onset of very elementary life. Interestingly,\nthere is the increasingly strong possibility that PeV cosmic rays are\nresponsible for the initiation of terrestrial lightning strokes and the\npossibility arises of considerable increases in the frequency of lightnings and\nthereby the formation of some of the complex molecules which are the 'building\nblocks of life'.

It has earlier been proposed that UHECRs could be\naccelerated in either the nucleus or the outer lobes of the nearby radio galaxy\nCen A. We show that UHECR production at a spatially intermediate location about\n15 kpc northeast from the nucleus, where the jet emerging from the nucleus is\nobserved to strike a large star-forming shell of gas, is a plausible\nalternative. A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud.

We will show that electrons in the atomic\nshells are stripped during the acceleration process, when the atoms already\nmove relativistically. For typical environment around SNRs the dominant\nionization process is the photo-ionization due to the background galactic\nradiation. The ionization has two interesting consequences.

The power spectral density (PSD)\nfunctions of the R-band variability of all six blazars are fit well by simple\npower-law functions with negative slope such that there is higher amplitude\nvariability on longer timescales. No clear break is identified in the PSD of\nany of the sources. The average slope of the PSD of R-band variability of these\nblazars is similar to what was found by the Fermi team for the gamma-ray\nvariability of a larger sample of bright blazars.

However, until now there has been no\nastrophysical motivation for considering a source highly enriched in heavy\nelements. Here we demonstrate that the outflows from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)\nmay indeed be composed primarily of nuclei with masses A ~ 40-200, which are\nsynthesized as hot material expands away from the central engine. In\nparticular, if the jet is magnetically-dominated (rather than a\nthermally-driven fireball) its low entropy enables heavy elements to form\nefficiently. Adopting the millisecond proto-magnetar model for the GRB central\nengine, we show that heavy nuclei are both synthesized in proto-magnetar winds\nand can in principle be accelerated to energies >1e20 eV in the shocks or\nregions of magnetic reconnection that are responsible for powering the GRB.\nSimilar results may apply to accretion-powered GRB models if the jet originates\nfrom a magnetized disk wind.

At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly.

This scheme combines\ntools from different techniques in General Relativity: It uses a multipolar,\npost-Minkowskian (MPM) expansion for the far-zone metric perturbation (which\nprovides the gravitational waveforms, here taken up to mass hexadecapole and\ncurrent octopole order) and for the local prescription of the self-force (since\nwe are lacking a general prescription for it); a post-Newtonian expansion for\nthe computation of the multipole moments in terms of the trajectories; and a BH\nperturbation theory expansion when treating the trajectories as a sequence of\nself-adjusting Kerr geodesics. The orbital evolution is thus equivalent to\nsolving the geodesic equations with time-dependent orbital elements, as\ndictated by the MPM radiation-reaction prescription.

In this model, a\nsettling subsonic accretion proceeds through a hot shell formed around the NS\nmagnetosphere. The accretion rate onto the NS is determined by the ability of\nthe plasma to enter the magnetosphere.Due to large Reynolds numbers in the\nshell, the interaction of the rotating magnetosphere with plasma initiates a\nsubsonic turbulence. The convective motions are capable of carrying the angular\nmomentum through the shell.

During high\nstate phases, the high-frequency SSC component often dominates the\nlow-frequency synchrotron component, implying that the inverse Compton SSC\nlosses of electrons are at least equal to or greater than the synchrotron\nlosses of electrons.

Here we examine the apparent radius in a\nhomogeneous sample of long, mixed H/He bursts from the low-mass X-ray binaries\nGS 1826-24 and KS 1731-26. The measured blackbody normalisation (proportional\nto the emitting area) in these bursts is constant over a period of up to 60s in\nthe burst tail, even though the flux (blackbody temperature) decreased by a\nfactor of 60-75% (30-40%). The typical rms variation in the mean normalisation\nfrom burst to burst was 3-5%, although a variation of 17% was found between\nbursts observed from GS 1826-24 in two epochs. A comparison of the\ntime-resolved spectroscopic measurements during bursts from the two epochs\nshows that the normalisation evolves consistently through the burst rise and\npeak, but subsequently increases further in the earlier epoch bursts.

In systems\naccreting at well below the Eddington rate, such as the central black hole in\nthe Milky Way (Sgr A*), the rate of Coulomb collisions between particles is\nvery small, making the disk evolve essentially as a collisionless plasma. We\npresent a nonlinear study of the collisionless MRI using first-principles\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations. In this initial study we focus on\nlocal two-dimensional (axisymmetric) simulations, deferring more realistic\nthree-dimensional simulations to future work. For simulations with net vertical\nmagnetic flux, the MRI continuously amplifies the magnetic field until the\nAlfv\\'en velocity, v_A, is comparable to the speed of light, c (independent of\nthe initial value of v_A/c). This is consistent with the lack of saturation of\nMRI channel modes in analogous axisymmetric MHD simulations.

The problem is relevant for probes of magnetic field in\ncosmic voids through gamma-ray observations. In addition, dissipation of such\nbeams could affect considerably the thermal history of the intergalactic medium\nand structure formation. We use a Monte Carlo method to quantify the properties\nof the blazar induced electromagnetic shower, in particular the bulk Lorentz\nfactor and the angular spread of the pair beam generated by the shower, as a\nfunction of distance from the blazar itself. We then use linear and nonlinear\nkinetic theory to study the stability of the pair beam against the growth of\nelectrostatic plasma waves, employing the Monte Carlo results for our\nquantitative estimates. We find that the fastest growing mode, like any\nperturbation mode with even a very modest component perpendicular to the beam\ndirection, cannot be described in the reactive regime. Due to the effect of\nnon-linear Landau damping, which suppresses the growth of plasma oscillations,\nthe beam relaxation timescale is found significantly longer than the inverse\nCompton loss time.

All this information is essential for understanding\nthe energetic particle acceleration that we discuss further in the review. For\ninstance, we show how fast and slow modes accelerate energetic particles\nthrough the second order Fermi acceleration, while density fluctuations\ngenerate magnetic fields in pre-shock regions enabling the first order Fermi\nacceleration of high energy cosmic rays. Very importantly, however, the first\norder Fermi cosmic ray acceleration is also possible in sites of magnetic\nreconnection. In the presence of turbulence this reconnection gets fast and we\npresent numerical evidence supporting the predictions of the Lazarian &\nVishniac (1999) model of fast reconnection. The efficiency of this process\nsuggests that magnetic reconnection can release substantial amounts of energy\nin short periods of time. As the particle tracing numerical simulations show\nthat the particles can be efficiently accelerated during the reconnection, we\nargue that the process of magnetic reconnection may be much more important for\nparticle acceleration than it is currently accepted. In particular, we discuss\nthe acceleration arising from reconnection as a possible origin of the\nanomalous cosmic rays measured by Voyagers as well as the origin cosmic ray\nexcess in the direction of Heliotail. \n\n"}

Several mysteries cloud the interpretation\nof this event: (1) extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray\nlight curve during the first 10 days after the gamma-ray trigger; (2)\nunexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission months after\ntrigger; (3) no obvious evidence for jet precession, despite misalignment\ntypically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disk and BH;\n(4) recent abrupt shut-off in jet X-ray emission after 1.5 years. Here we show\nthat all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one\nassumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi threading the BH.\nInitially, Phi is weak relative to high fall-back mass accretion rate, Mdot,\nand the disk and jets precess about the BH axis = our line of sight. As Mdot\ndrops, Phi becomes dynamically important and leads to a magnetically-arrested\ndisk (MAD). MAD naturally aligns disk and jet axis along the BH spin axis, but\nonly after a violent rearrangement phase (jet wobbling). This explains the\nerratic light curve at early times and the lack of precession at later times.\nWe use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain BH and disrupted star\nproperties, finding that a solar-mass main sequence star disrupted by a\nrelatively low mass, M~10^5-10^6 Msun, BH is consistent with the data, while a\nWD disruption (though still possible) is disfavored.

We examine the influence of the X-rays from the\nwind-wind collision shocks on the radiative driving of the stellar winds using\nsteady state models that include a parameterized line force with X-ray\nionization dependence. Our primary result is that X-ray radiation from the\nshocks inhibits wind acceleration and can lead to a lower pre-shock velocity,\nand a correspondingly lower shocked plasma temperature, yet the intrinsic X-ray\nluminosity of the shocks, LX remains largely unaltered, with the exception of a\nmodest increase at small binary separations.

The wind fluid near the star is composed of neutrons and protons, and\nthe neutrons become relativistic while collisionally coupled with the ions.\nHere, we argue that the neutrons in the flow eventually undergo inelastic\ncollisions around the termination shock inside the stellar material, producing\n~0.1-1 GeV neutrinos, without relying on cosmic-ray acceleration mechanisms.\nEven higher-energy neutrinos may be produced via particle acceleration\nmechanisms.

We explain both puzzles here. Using the publicly available\nVESPA database of SDSS Data Release 7 spectra, we explore a multi-parameter\nspace in galaxy properties, like stellar mass, metallicity, dust etc. to find\nthe sub-set of galaxies that reproduce the recently obtained GRB rate by\nWanderman & Piran (2010). We find that only galaxies with present stellar\nmasses below < 10^{10} Msun and low metallicity reproduce the observed GRB\nrate. This is consistent with direct observations of GRB hosts and provides an\nindependent confirmation of the nature of GRB hosts. Because of the\nsignificantly larger sample of SDSS galaxies, we compute their correlation\nfunction and show that they are anti-biased with respect to the dark matter:\nthey are in filaments and voids. Using recent observations of massive stars in\nlocal dwarfs we show how the fact that GRB hosts galaxies are dwarfs can\nexplain the observation that GRBs are more concentrated in regions of high star\nformation than SNe.

In this paper, we propose a new interpretation of the data\nthat it originates from decay of two dark matter. This interpretation gives a\nrough threshold of the lighter DM component. When DM decays into leptons, the\npositron fraction in the cosmic ray depends on the flavor of the final states,\nand this is fixed by imposing non-Abelian discrete symmetry in our model.

We\nestimate the typical energy and fluence of the neutrinos from such a scenario.\nWe find that $\\sim$PeV neutrinos could be emitted from the shock front as long\nas the ejecta could be accelerated to a relativistic speed. The diffuse\nneutrino flux from these events, even under the most optimistic scenarios, is\ntoo low to account for the two events announced by the IceCube Collaboration,\nbut it is only slightly lower than the diffuse flux of GRBs, making it an\nimportant candidate for the diffuse background of $\\sim$PeV neutrinos. The\nneutron-pion decay of these events make them a moderate contributor to the\nsub-TeV gamma-ray diffuse background. \n\n"}

This code combines Monte Carlo method that tracks the\nradiative processes including inverse Compton scattering, and Fokker-Planck\nequation that follows the cooling and acceleration of particles. It is a\ncomprehensive time dependent code that fully takes into account the light\ntravel time effects. In this study, both the changes of the magnetic field and\nacceleration efficiency are explored as the cause of blazar flares. Under these\nassumption, synchrotron self-Compton and external Compton scenarios produce\ndistinct features that favor the external Compton scenario. The optical flares\nwith/without gamma-ray counterparts can be explained by different allocations\nof energy between the magnetization and particle acceleration, which in turn\ncan be affected by the relative orientation between the magnetic field and the\nshock flow. We compare the details of the observations and simulation, and\nhighlight what implications this study has on our understanding of relativistic\njets. \n\n"}

The tail is most likely caused by the nearly\nedge-on stripping of ESO 137-002's ISM by ram pressure, compared to the nearly\nface-on stripping of ESO 137-001 discussed in our previous work. Spectral\nanalysis of individual regions along the tail shows that the gas throughout it\nhas a rather constant temperature, ~1 keV, very close to the temperature of the\ntails of ESO 137-001, if the same atomic database is used. The derived gas\nabundance is low (~0.2 solar with the single-kT model), an indication of the\nmultiphase nature of the gas in the tail. The mass of the X-ray tail is only a\nsmall fraction (<5%) of the initial ISM mass of the galaxy, suggesting that the\nstripping is most likely at an early stage. However, with any of the single-kT,\ndouble-kT and multi-kT models we tried, the tail is always \"over-pressured\"\nrelative to the surrounding ICM, which could be due to the uncertainties in the\nabundance, thermal vs. non-thermal X-ray emission, or magnetic support in the\nICM.

This could either be due to a true divergence in orbital\nperiod distributions of these two types of system, or to black hole LMXBs being\npreferentially hidden from view at short orbital periods. We explore the latter\npossibility, by investigating whether black hole LMXBs could be concealed by a\nswitch to radiatively inefficient accretion at low luminosities. The peak\nluminosity and the duration of X-ray binary outbursts are related to the disc\nradius and, hence, the orbital period. At short periods, where the peak\noutburst luminosity drops close to the threshold for radiatively inefficient\naccretion, black hole LMXBs have lower outburst luminosities, shorter outburst\ndurations and lower X-ray duty cycles than comparable neutron star systems.\nThese factors can combine to severely reduce the detection probability of short\nperiod black hole LMXBs relative to those containing neutron stars. We estimate\nthe outburst properties and orbital period distribution of black hole LMXBs\nusing two models of the transition to radiatively inefficient accretion: an\ninstantaneous drop in accretion efficiency (eta) to zero, at a fraction (f) of\nthe Eddington luminosity (L_Edd) and a power-law efficiency decrease, eta\n\\propto \\dot{M}^n, for L < f*L_Edd.

The shock compresses the plasma and\naccelerates electrons to energies up to gamma(max) > 1E4 times their rest-mass\nenergy, with the value of gamma(max) determined by the direction of the\nmagnetic field relative to the shock front.

The density of high-energy electrons in the plasma\nchanges randomly with time in a manner consistent with the power spectral\ndensity of flux variations derived from observations of blazars.

In this paper, we compute light curves and images associated with\ncompact emission regions (hot spots) orbiting around Kerr and non-Kerr black\nholes. We study how the analysis of the properties of the radiation emitted by\na hot spot can be used to test the Kerr nature of SgrA$^*$. We find that the\nsole observation of the hot spot light curve can at most constrain a\ncombination of the black hole spin and of possible deviations from the Kerr\nsolution. This happens because the same orbital frequency around a Kerr black\nhole can be found for a non-Kerr object with a different spin parameter.

An intriguing\npossibility is the decay of sterile neutrino, a long-sought dark matter\nparticle candidate. Assuming that all dark matter is in sterile neutrinos with\nm_s=2E=7.1 keV, our detection in the full sample corresponds to a neutrino\ndecay mixing angle sin^2(2theta)=7e-11, below the previous upper limits.\nHowever, based on the cluster masses and distances, the line in Perseus is much\nbrighter than expected in this model.

The inner boundary of the\nsimulation domain is carefully chosen so that the fiducial Bondi radius is\nresolved and the accretion rate of the black hole is determined\nself-consistently. In analogy to previous works, we assume that the specific\nangular momentum of the galaxy is low. It is well-known that when the accretion\nrates are high and low, the central AGNs will be in cold and hot accretion\nmodes, which correspond to the radiative and kinetic feedback modes,\nrespectively. The emitted spectrum from the hot accretion flows is harder than\nthat from the cold accretion flows, which could result in a higher Compton\ntemperature accompanied by a more efficient radiative heating, according to\nprevious theoretical works.

We find that the ICM entropy around the quasar is significantly lower\nthan that of other similarly massive strong cool core clusters within the\ncentral 80 kpc, and that the entropy lies significantly below the extrapolated\nbaseline entropy profile from hierarchical structure formation. By comparing\nthe scaled temperature profile with those of other strong cool core clusters of\nsimilar total mass, we see that the entropy deficiency is due to the central\ntemperature being significantly lower. This suggests that the presence of the\nquasar in the core of H1821+643 has had a dramatic cooling effect on the\nintracluster medium around it.

I: Stellar mass at z<1 Abstract: LGRBs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to star\nformation. The conditions necessary to produce LGRBs can affect the relation\nbetween the LGRB rate and star formation. By using the power of a complete LGRB\nsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,\nwhat is its origin. In this first paper, we build the SED of the z<1 host\ngalaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample, and determine their stellar masses from SED\nfitting. We compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) with\nstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA); (ii) with\nsemi-analitical models of the z<1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) with\nnumerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for\nthe progenitor star environment. We find that at z<1 LGRBs tend to avoid\nmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forming\ngalaxies. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with\nthat of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted for their SFR. This\nimplies that, at least at z<1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star\nformation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-end\nof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow SFR-Mass relation for\nthe low mass galaxy population. GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to\nreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order\nof Z_th=0.3-0.5Z_sun is necessary.

At a redshift of z=0.7403, derived from narrow absorption lines,\niPTF13ajg peaked at an absolute magnitude M(u,AB)=-22.5, one of the most\nluminous supernovae to date. The uBgRiz light curves, obtained with the P48,\nP60, NOT, DCT, and Keck telescopes, and the nine-epoch spectral sequence\nsecured with the Keck and the VLT (covering 3 rest-frame months), are tied\ntogether photometrically to provide an estimate of the flux evolution as a\nfunction of time and wavelength. The observed bolometric peak luminosity of\niPTF13ajg is 3.2x10^44 erg/s, while the estimated total radiated energy is\n1.3x10^51 erg. We detect narrow absorption lines of Mg I, Mg II, and Fe II,\nassociated with the cold interstellar medium in the host galaxy, at two\ndifferent epochs with X-shooter at the VLT.

These column densities, as well as the Mg I and\nMg II equivalent widths of a sample of hydrogen-poor SLSNe taken from the\nliterature, are at the low end of those derived for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs),\nwhose progenitors are also thought to be massive stars. This suggests that the\nenvironments of SLSNe and GRBs are different.

However, recently, it has been claimed that nonlinear Landau damping\nrenders it physically irrelevant by reducing the effective damping rate to a\nlow level. Here, we show with numerical calculations that the effective damping\nrate is $8\\times 10^{-4}$ of the growth rate of the linear instability, which\nis sufficient for the \"oblique\" instability to be the dominant cooling\nmechanism of these pair beams. In particular, we show that previous estimates\nof this rate ignored the exponential cutoff in the scattering amplitude at\nlarge wavenumber and assumed that the damping of scattered waves entirely\ndepends on collisions, ignoring collisionless processes. We find that the total\nwave energy eventually grows to approximate equipartition with the beam by\nincreasingly depositing energy into long wavelength modes. As we have not\nincluded the effect of nonlinear wave-wave interactions on these long\nwavelength modes, this scenario represents the \"worst-case\" scenario for the\noblique instability. As it continues to drain energy from the beam at a faster\nrate than other processes, we conclude that the \"oblique\" instability is\nsufficiently strong to make it the physically dominant cooling mechanism for\nhigh-energy pair beams in the intergalactic medium. \n\n"}

In general, in this\nkind of leading order tunnelling calculations, the exponent arises indeed from\nthe classical action and the pre-factor is an order Planck constant correction.\nBut in the case of emissions of Hawking quanta, the variation of the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy is order 1 for an emitted particle having energy of\norder the Hawking temperature. As a consequence, the exponent in the Parikh and\nWilczek probability of emission is order unity and one asks what is the real\nsignificance of that scaling if the pre-factor is unknown.

Recent\ninvestigations on thermal timescale mass transfer in WD binaries demonstrate\nthat the resultant MSPs are likely to have relatively wide orbit periods\n($\\gtrsim 10$ days).

Likewise, quasiperiodic\nvariability has been observed in several sources. Such measurements commonly\nmake the assumption that black holes are described by the Kerr metric, which\naccording to the no-hair theorem characterizes black holes uniquely in terms of\ntheir masses and spins.

Each 'step' in the cascade will modify the observable\nsignatures of dark matter annihilation and decay, shifting the resulting\nphotons and other final state particles to lower energies and broadening their\nspectra. We explore, in a model-independent way, the effect of multi-step\ndark-sector cascades on the preferred regions of parameter space to explain the\nGeV excess. We find that the broadening effects of multi-step cascades can\nadmit final states dominated by particles that would usually produce too\nsharply peaked photon spectra; in general, if the cascades are hierarchical\n(each particle decays to substantially lighter particles), the preferred mass\nrange for the dark matter is in all cases 20-150 GeV. Decay chains that have\nnearly-degenerate steps, where the products are close to half the mass of the\nprogenitor, can admit much higher DM masses. We map out the region of\nmass/cross-section parameter space where cascades (degenerate, hierarchical or\na combination) can fit the signal, for a range of final states.

We examine radii ~0.1-100 pc around a black hole (BH), where the\naccretion rate onto the BH is determined and where AGN-powered winds and\nradiation couple to the ISM. We conclude: (1) The BH accretion rate is\ndetermined by exchange of angular momentum between gas and stars in\ngravitational instabilities. This produces accretion rates ~0.03-1 Msun/yr,\nsufficient to power luminous AGN. (2) The gas disk in the galactic nucleus\nundergoes an initial burst of star formation followed by several Myrs where\nstellar feedback suppresses the star formation rate (SFR). (3) AGN winds\ninjected at small radii with momentum fluxes ~L/c couple efficiently to the ISM\nand have dramatic effects on ISM properties within ~100 pc.

Such a BH-torus system can be formed in compact binary\nmergers and is able to launch a relativistic jet, which can then produce the\nSGRB. This basic scenario, however, has recently been challenged by Swift\nsatellite observations, which have revealed long-lasting X-ray afterglows in\nassociation with a large fraction of SGRB events.

Here we assume that the neutrino flux from FSRQs is\nproportional to their gamma-ray ones, and obtain the gamma-ray/neutrino flux\nratio by the diffuse gamma-ray flux from Fermi-LAT measurement of FSRQs and the\ndiffuse neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We apply this ratio to individual\nFSRQs and hence predict their neutrino flux. We find that a large fraction of\ncandidate FSRQs from the northern sky in the IceCube point source search has\npredicted neutrino flux above the IceCube upper limit; and for the sample of\nstacking search for neutrinos by IceCube, the predicted stacked flux is even\nlarger than the upper limit of stacked flux by orders of magnitude. Therefore\nthe IceCube limit from stacking searches, combined with the Fermi-LAT\nobservations, already rejects FSRQs as the main sources of IceCube-detected\ndiffuse neutrinos: FSRQs can only account for <10% (4%) of the IceCube-detected\ndiffuse neutrino flux, according to the stacking searches from the whole\n(northern) sky. The derived neutrino/gamma-ray flux ratio is <<1, also implying\nthat the gamma-ray emission from FSRQs cannot be produced by the secondary\nleptons and photons from the pion production processes. The caveat in the\nassumptions is discussed. \n\n"}

Their orbits are expected to be circular\ndue to tidal interactions during the binary evolution, as observed in most of\nthe binary MSPs. There are some peculiar systems that do not fit this picture.\nThree recent examples are PSRs J2234$+$06, J1946$+$3417 and J1950$+$2414, all\nof which are MSPs in eccentric orbits but with mass functions compatible with\nexpected He white dwarf companions. It has been suggested these MSPs may have\nformed from delayed accretion-induced collapse of massive white dwarfs, or the\neccentricity may be induced by dynamical interaction between the binary and a\ncircumbinary disk. Assuming that the core density of accreting neutron stars in\nLMXBs may reach the density of quark deconfinement, which can lead to phase\ntransition from neutron stars to strange quark stars, we show that the\nresultant MSPs are likely to have an eccentric orbit, due to the sudden loss of\nthe gravitational mass of the neutron star during the transition. The\neccentricities can be reproduced with a reasonable estimate of the mass loss.\nThis scenario might also account for the formation of the youngest known X-ray\nbinary Cir X$-$1, which also possesses a low-field compact star in an eccentric\norbit. \n\n"}

Using analytical models of\nstructure formation and dark matter halo properties, we compute the gamma-ray\nflux distribution due to annihilations in extragalactic dark matter halos, as\nit would be observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope.

The sample consists of nearly 340 sources with\neither photometric (212) or spectroscopic (128) redshift in the above range.\nThe combination of deep and shallow survey fields provides a luminosity\nbaseline of three orders of magnitude, Lx(2-10keV)~1e43-1e46erg/s at z>3. We\nfollow a Bayesian approach to determine the binned AGN space density and\nexplore their evolution in a model-independent way. Our methodology accounts\nfor Poisson errors in the determination of X-ray fluxes and uncertainties in\nphotometric redshift estimates. We demonstrate that the latter is essential for\nunbiased measurement of space densities. We find that the AGN X-ray luminosity\nfunction evolves strongly between the redshift intervals z=3-4 and z=4-5. There\nis also suggestive evidence that the amplitude of this evolution is luminosity\ndependent. The space density of AGN with Lx<1e45erg/s drops by a factor of 5\nbetween the redshift intervals above, while the evolution of brighter AGN\nappears to be milder. Comparison of our X-ray luminosity function with that of\nUV/optical selected QSOs at similar redshifts shows broad agreement at bright\nluminosities, Lx>1e45erg/s. The faint-end slope of UV/optical luminosity\nfunctions however, is steeper than for X-ray selected AGN. This implies that\nthe type-I AGN fraction increases with decreasing luminosity at z>3, opposite\nto trends established at lower redshift. We also assess the significance of AGN\nin keeping the hydrogen ionised at high redshift. Our X-ray luminosity function\nyields ionising photon rate densities that are insufficient to keep the\nUniverse ionised at redshift z>4.

It is generally accepted that these jets are powered\nelectromagnetically, by the magnetised rotation of a central compact object.\nHowever, how they produce the observed emission and survive the propagation for\nmany orders of magnitude in distance without being disrupted by current-driven\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities is the subject of active debate. We carry out\ntime-dependent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic,\nPoynting flux dominated jets. The jets are launched self-consistently by the\nrotation of a strongly magnetised central compact object. This determines the\nnatural degree of azimuthal magnetic field winding, a crucial factor that\ncontrols jet stability. We find that the jets are susceptible to two types of\ninstability: (i) a global, external kink mode that grows on long time scales\nand causes the jets to bodily bend sideways. Whereas this mode does not cause\njet disruption over the simulated distances, it substantially reduces jet\npropagation speed. We show, via an analytic model, that the growth of the\nexternal kink mode depends on the slope of the ambient medium density profile.\nIn flat density distributions characteristic of galactic cores, an AGN jet may\nstall, whereas in stellar envelopes the external kink weakens as the jet\npropagates outward; (ii) a local, internal kink mode that grows over short time\nscales and causes small-angle magnetic reconnection and conversion of about\nhalf of jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat. Based on the robustness and\nenergetics of the internal kink mode, we suggest that this instability is the\nmain dissipation mechanism responsible for powering GRB prompt emission. \n\n"}

These facts may lead people to believe that\ngravitational theories with long-ranged scalar fields have already been\nconstrained strongly from binary pulsar observations. Here we challenge this\n\"lore\" by investigating the decoupling limit of Gauss-Bonnet gravity as an\nexample, in which the scalar field couples linearly to the Gauss-Bonnet density\nin the action. We prove a theorem that neutron stars in this theory cannot\npossess a scalar charge. Thus Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the strong binary\npulsar constraints on dipole radiation. We discuss the astrophysical systems\nyielding the best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity and related quadratic\ngravity theories. To achieve this we explicitly compute the scalar charge for\nslowly-rotating neutron stars in quadratic gravity theories. In generic case,\neither neutron star-binary or neutron star-black hole systems can be used to\nconstrain the theory, but Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the neutron star-binary\nconstraints. However, black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity do anchor scalar\ncharge. The best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity will thus come from black\nhole observations, for example via pulsar-black hole binaries. We estimate\nthese constraints to be ten times better than the current estimated bound, and\nalso include estimated constraints on generic quadratic gravity theories. \n\n"}

Previous studies have predominantly\nemployed model WDs composed entirely of carbon-oxygen (CO), whereas WDs are\nexpected to have a non-negligible helium envelope. Given that helium is more\nsusceptible to explosive burning than CO under the conditions characteristic of\nWD collision, a legitimate concern is whether or not early time He detonation\nignition can translate to early time CO detonation, thereby drastically\nreducing $^{56}$Ni synthesis. We investigate the role of He in determining the\nfate of WD collisions by performing a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamics\ncalculations. We find that a necessary condition for non-trivial reduction of\nthe CO ignition time is that the He detonation birthed in the contact region\nsuccessfully propagates into the unshocked shell. We determine the minimal He\nshell mass as a function of the total WD mass that upholds this condition.\nAlthough we utilize a simplified reaction network similar to those used in\nprevious studies, our findings are in good agreement with detailed\ninvestigations concerning the impact of network size on He shell detonations.\nThis allows us to extend our results to the case with more realistic burning\nphysics. Based on the comparison of these findings against evolutionary\ncalculations of WD compositions, we conclude that most, if not all, WD\ncollisions will not be drastically impacted by their intrinsic He components. \n\n"}

We here re-analyze an\nintriguing gedanken experiment which was designed by Bekenstein to challenge\nthe GSL. In this historical gedanken experiment an entropy-bearing box is\nlowered into a charged Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole. For the GSL to work,\nthe resulting increase in the black-hole surface area (entropy) must compensate\nfor the loss of the box's entropy. We show that if the box can be lowered\nadiabatically all the way down to the black-hole horizon, as previously assumed\nin the literature, then for near-extremal black holes the resulting increase in\nblack-hole surface-area (due to the assimilation of the box by the black hole)\nmay become too small to compensate for the loss of the box's entropy. In order\nto resolve this apparent violation of the GSL, we here suggest to use a\ngeneralized version of the hoop conjecture. In particular, assuming that a\nphysical system of mass $M$ and electric charge $Q$ forms a black hole if its\ncircumference radius $r_{\\text{c}}$ is equal to (or smaller than) the\ncorresponding Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black-hole radius\n$r_{\\text{RN}}=M+\\sqrt{M^2-Q^2}$, we prove that a new (and larger) horizon is\nalready formed before the entropy-bearing box reaches the horizon of the\noriginal near-extremal black hole.

This\nsupernova model takes into account the formation and evolution of a\nprotoneutron star, neutrino-matter interaction, and neutrino transport, all\nwithin a two-dimensional shock hydrodynamics simulation. With this, we\nseparately discuss three situations: (i) a CCSN at the Galactic Center, (ii) an\nextremely nearby CCSN within hundreds of parsecs, and (iii) a CCSN in nearby\ngalaxies within several Mpc. These distance regimes necessitate different\nstrategies for synergistic observations. In a Galactic CCSN, neutrinos provide\nstrategic timing and pointing information.

In a magnetar, the\nLandau levels of degenerate and relativistic electrons are strongly quantized.\nA new quantity $g_{n}$, the electron Landau-level stability coefficient is\nintroduced. According to the requirement that $g_{n}$ decreases with increasing\nthe magnetic field intensity $B$, the magnetic-field index $\\beta$ in the\nexpression of $E_{\\rm F}(e)$ must be positive.

We\nre-observed the sample using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in\nfull polarization, with 6 GHz of densely sampled frequency coverage spanning\n1.3 to 10 GHz. We have devised a general polarization modelling technique that\nallows us to identify multiple polarized emission components in a source, and\nto characterize their properties.

We use numerical simulations to explore the evolution\nof BHBs inside the radius of influence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in\ngalactic centers. In this region the evolution of binaries is dominated by\nperturbations from the central SMBH. In particular, as first pointed out by\nAntonini and Perets, the Kozai-Lidov (KL) mechanism trades relative inclination\nof the BHB to the SMBH for eccentricity of the BHB, and for some orientations\ncan bring the BHB to an eccentricity near unity. At very high eccentricities,\nGW emission from the BHB can become efficient, causing the members of the BHB\nto coalesce. We use a novel combination of two N-body codes to follow this\nevolution.

These events with visual peak\nmagnitudes $\\lesssim-21$ are called superluminous SNe (SLSNe). Aims: There are\na few intermediate events which have luminosities between these two classes.\nHere we study one such object, SN 2012aa. Methods: The optical photometric and\nspectroscopic follow-up observations of the event were conducted over a time\nspan of about 120 days. Results: With V_abs at peak ~-20 mag, the SN is an\nintermediate-luminosity transient between regular SNe Ibc and SLSNe. It also\nexhibits an unusual secondary bump after the maximum in its light curve. We\ninterpret this as a manifestation of SN-shock interaction with the CSM. If we\nwould assume a $^{56}$Ni-powered ejecta, the bolometric light curve requires\nroughly 1.3 M_sun of $^{56}$Ni and an ejected mass of ~14 M_sun. This would\nalso imply a high kinetic energy of the explosion, ~5.4$\\times10^{51}$ ergs. On\nthe other hand, the unusually broad light curve along with the secondary peak\nindicate the possibility of interaction with CSM. The third alternative is the\npresence of a central engine releasing spin energy that eventually powers the\nlight curve over a long time. The host of the SN is a star-forming Sa/Sb/Sbc\ngalaxy. Conclusions: Although the spectral properties and velocity evolution of\nSN 2012aa are comparable to those of normal SNe Ibc, its broad light curve\nalong with a large peak luminosity distinguish it from canonical CCSNe,\nsuggesting the event to be an intermediate-luminosity transient between CCSNe\nand SLSNe at least in terms of peak luminosity.

Recently, several empirical luminosity correlations have been\nstatistically proposed from GRB observations. However, to treat GRB as the\ndistance indicator, there are two key issues: the redshift evolution of\nluminosity correlations and their calibrations. In this paper, we choose the\nAmati relation, the correlation between the peak spectra energy and the\nequivalent isotropic energy of GRBs ($E_{\\rm p}-E_{\\rm iso}$), as an example,\nand find that the current GRB dataset implies that there could be a evolution\nof the luminosity correlation with respect to the redshift. Therefore, we\npropose an extended Amati relation with two extra redshift-dependent terms to\ncorrect the redshift evolution of GRB relation. Secondly, we carefully check\nthe reliability of the calibration method using the low-redshift GRB data.\nImportantly, we find that the low-redshift calibration method does not take\nwhole correlations between $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and coefficients into account.\nNeglecting these correlation information can break the degeneracies and obtain\nthe biased constraint on $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ which is very sensitive to values of\nparameters for the calibration. A small shift of parameters of \"calibrated\"\nrelation could significantly change the final constraint on $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ in\nthe low-redshift calibration method. Finally, we simulate several GRB samples\nwith different statistical errors and find that, in order to correctly recover\nthe fiducial value of $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ using the low-redshift calibration\nmethod, we need a large number of GRB samples with high precisions. \n\n"}

We undertake a population synthesis study to compute the delay-time\ndistribution of core-collapse supernovae, that is, the supernova rate versus\ntime following a starburst, taking into account binary interactions. We test\nthe systematic robustness of our results by running various simulations to\naccount for the uncertainties in our standard assumptions. We find that a\nsignificant fraction, $15^{+9}_{-8}$%, of core-collapse supernovae are `late',\nthat is, they occur 50-200 Myrs after birth, when all massive single stars have\nalready exploded. These late events originate predominantly from binary systems\nwith at least one, or, in most cases, with both stars initially being of\nintermediate mass ($4-8M_{\\odot}$). The main evolutionary channels that\ncontribute often involve either the merging of the initially more massive\nprimary star with its companion or the engulfment of the remaining core of the\nprimary by the expanding secondary that has accreted mass at an earlier\nevolutionary stage. Also, the total number of core-collapse supernovae\nincreases by $14^{+15}_{-14}$% because of binarity for the same initial stellar\nmass. The high rate implies that we should have already observed such late\ncore-collapse supernovae, but have not recognized them as such.

In recent years, high-quality X-ray observations\nhave allowed for detailed measurements of the Fe K$\\alpha$ emission line, where\nrelativistic line broadening allows constraints on the spin parameter (the\nX-ray reflection method).

A detailed comparison of the two methods is also useful because\nneither method can be applied to all AGN. The X-ray reflection technique\ntargets mostly local (z $\\lesssim$ 0.1) systems, while the CF method can be\napplied at higher redshift, up to and beyond the peak of AGN activity and\ngrowth.

Previous studies of such stars were either unable to\nresolve hydrodynamical timescales or considered stars in isolation, not in the\nextreme accretion flows in which they actually form. Therefore, they could not\nself-consistently predict their final masses at collapse, or those of the\nresulting supermassive black hole seeds, but rather invoked comparison to\nsimple polytropic models. Here, we systematically examine the birth, evolution\nand collapse of accreting non-rotating supermassive stars under accretion rates\nof 0.01-10 solar masses per year, using the stellar evolution code KEPLER. Our\napproach includes post-Newtonian corrections to the stellar structure and an\nadaptive nuclear network, and can transition to following the hydrodynamic\nevolution of supermassive stars after they encounter the general relativistic\ninstability. We find that this instability triggers the collapse of the star at\nmasses of 150,000-330,000 solar masses for accretion rates of 0.1-10 solar\nmasses per year, and that the final mass of the star scales roughly\nlogarithmically with the rate. The structure of the star, and thus its\nstability against collapse, is sensitive to the treatment of convection, and\nthe heat content of the outer accreted envelope. Comparison with other codes\nsuggests differences here may lead to small deviations in the evolutionary\nstate of the star as a function of time, that worsen with accretion rate.

The generalization to rapid\nrotation is important because on one hand the rapid rotation can magnify the\ndeviations from general relativity compared to the static case and on the other\nhand some of the most efficient emitters of gravitational radiation, such as\nthe binary neutron star merger remnants, are supposed to be rotating close to\ntheir Kepler (mass-shedding) limits shortly after their formation.

We use an artificial neural network algorithm\naimed at distinguishing BL Lacs from FSRQs to investigate the source subclass\nof 559 3FGL unassociated sources characterised by $\\gamma$-ray properties very\nsimilar to those of Active Galactic Nuclei. Based on our method, we can\nclassify 271 objects as BL Lac candidates, 185 as FSRQ candidates, leaving only\n103 without a clear classification. we suggest a new zoo for $\\gamma$-ray\nobjects, where the percentage of sources of uncertain type drops from 52% to\nless than 10%. The result of this study opens up new considerations on the\npopulation of the $\\gamma$-ray sky, and it will facilitate the planning of\nsignificant samples for rigorous analyses and multiwavelength observational\ncampaigns. \n\n"}

This makes GRB111117A the most distant\nhigh-confidence short duration GRB detected to date. Our spectroscopic redshift\nsupersedes a lower, previously estimated photometric redshift value for this\nburst. We use the spectroscopic redshift, as well as new imaging data to\nconstrain the nature of the host galaxy and the physical parameters of the GRB.\nThe rest-frame X-ray derived hydrogen column density, for example, is the\nhighest compared to a complete sample of sGRBs and seems to follow the\nevolution with redshift as traced by the hosts of long GRBs (lGRBs). The host\nlies in the brighter end of the expected sGRB host brightness distribution at\n$z = 2.211$, and is actively forming stars.

At redshift z=0.031, Gaia17biu is also the lowest redshift\nSLSN-I to date, and the absence of a larger population of SLSNe-I in dwarf\ngalaxies of similar redshift suggests that metallicity is likely less important\nto the production of SLSNe-I than previously believed. With the smallest\ndistance and highest apparent brightness for an SLSN-I, we are able to study\nGaia17biu in unprecedented detail. Its pre-peak near-ultraviolet to optical\ncolor is similar to that of Gaia16apd and among the bluest observed for an\nSLSN-I while its peak luminosity (M_g = -21 mag) is substantially lower than\nGaia16apd.

However, evolving the full Boltzmann\nequations of radiative transport is extremely expensive.

The algorithm is based\non a gray two-moment scheme, in which we evolve the energy density and momentum\ndensity of the radiation.

The connection\nbetween relativistic precession and the resulting QPO has been made either in\nterms of a simplified model involving a single test particle producing the QPO,\nor in terms of a global model where a geometrically thick accretion flow\nprecesses coherently as a rigid body.

We find that the dipole axis is not\nstationary with respect to the neutron star's surface and does not in general\ncoincide with the location of the magnetic spot. This is due to\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities of the toroidal field that displace the poloidal\ndipole axis at rates that may reach $0.4^{\\circ}$ per century. A misaligned\npoloidal dipole axis with the toroidal field leads to more significant\ndisplacement of the dipole axis than the fully aligned case.

This behaviour might be explained by quasispherical accretion onto a\nslowly rotating magnetised neutron star. In quiescence, the neutron star in\n4U1700-37 is surrounded by a hot radiatively cooling shell. Its presence is\nsupported by the detection of mHz quasi periodic oscillations likely produced\nby its convection cells. The high plasma temperature and the relatively low\nX-ray luminosity observed during the quiescence, point to a small emitting area\nabout 1 km, compatible with a hot spot on a NS surface.

Since the shadow is determined by a set of\nspecial photon orbits, rather than horizon properties, it is possible that\ndifferent horizon geometries yield similar shadows. One may then ask how\nsensitive is the shadow to details of the horizon geometry? As a case study, we\nconsider the double Schwarzschild BH and analyse the impact on the lensing and\nshadows of the conical singularity that holds the two BHs in equilibrium --\nherein taken to be a strut along the symmetry axis in between the two BHs.\nWhereas the conical singularity induces a discontinuity of the scattering angle\nof photons, clearly visible in the lensing patterns along the direction of the\nstrut's location, it produces no observable effect on the shadows, whose edges\nremain everywhere smooth.

Approximately after half of the\nlight curves, the correlation between the broad emission lines and the\nlag-corrected ultraviolet continua becomes weak. This anomalous behavior is\naccompanied by an increase of soft X-ray emission. We propose a simple model to\nunderstand this anomalous behavior, i.e., the corona might fall down, thereby\nincreasing the covering fraction of the inner disk. Therefore, X-ray and\nextreme ultraviolet emission suffer from spectral variations. The ultraviolet\ncontinua variations are driven by both X-ray and extreme ultraviolet\nvariations. Consequently, the spectral variability induced by the falling\ncorona would dilute the correlation between the broad emission lines and the\nultraviolet continua. Our model can explain many additional observational\nfacts, including the dependence of the anomalous behavior on velocity and\nionization energy. We also show that the time lag and correlation between the\nX-ray and the ultraviolet variations change as NGC 5548 displays the anomalous\nbehavior. The time lag is dramatically longer than the expectation from disk\nreprocessing if the anomalous behavior is properly excluded. During the\nanomalous state, the time lag approaches the light-travel timescale of disk\nreprocessing albeit with a much weaker correlation. We speculate that the time\nlag in the normal state is caused by reprocessing of the broad line region gas.\nAs NGC 5548 enters the abnormal state, the contribution of the broad line\nregion gas is smaller; the time lag reflects disk reprocessing.

We show\nthat this conclusion is valid only for non-magnetized jets. RMSs that propagate\nin moderately magnetized plasma develop a collisionless subshock which locally\nheats the plasma to a relativistic temperature, and the hot electrons emit\ncopious synchrotron photons inside the RMS.

We find that z_max=1.70 +\\- 0.20---an important new probe of the\nUniverse's geometry. The most strongly favoured model is R_h=ct, followed by\nPlanck LCDM.

According to these results, the R_h=ct\nuniverse, which predicts z_max=1.718, has a ~92.8% probability of being the\ncorrect cosmology. For consistency, we also carry out model selection based on\nd_A(z) itself. This test confirms that R_h=ct and Planck LCDM are among the few\nmodels that account for angular-size data better than those that are\ndisfavoured by z_max.

If strong\nfirst-order phase transitions do not exist within neutron stars, both neutron\nstars are described by the same equation of state, and their Lambdas are highly\ncorrelated through their masses even if the equation of state is unknown. If,\nhowever, a strong phase transition exists between the central densities of the\ntwo stars, so that the more massive star has a phase transition and the least\nmassive star does not, this correlation will be weakened. In all cases, a\nminimum Lambda for each neutron star mass is imposed by causality, and a less\nconservative limit is imposed by the unitary gas constraint, both of which we\ncompute. In order to make the best use of gravitational wave data from mergers,\nit is important to include the correlations relating the Lambdas and the masses\nas well as lower limits to the Lambdas as a function of mass. Focusing on the\ncase without strong phase transitions, and for mergers where the chirp mass\nM_chirp<1.4M_sun, which is the case for all observed double neutron star\nsystems where a total mass has been accurately measured, we show that the\ndimensionless Lambdas satisfy Lambda_1/Lambda_2= q^6, where q=M_2/M_1 is the\nbinary mass ratio; $M$ is mass of each star, respectively. Moreover, they are\nbounded by q^{n_-}>Lambda_1/Lambda_2> q^{n_{0+}+qn_{1+}}, where\nn_-<n_{0+}+qn_{1+}; the parameters depend only on M_chirp, which is accurately\ndetermined from the gravitational-wave signal. We also provide analytic\nexpressions for the wider bounds that exist in the case of a strong phase\ntransition. We argue that bounded ranges for Lambda_1/Lambda_2, tuned to\nM_chirp, together with lower bounds to Lambda(M), will be more useful in\ngravitational waveform modeling than other suggested approaches. \n\n"}

We argue that\nAbell 1319 is likely in its pre-merging phase, where three separate cluster\ncomponents are about to merge. There are no radio halos nor radio relics\ndetected in this system. Abell 1314 is a highly-disturbed, low-mass cluster\nwhich is likely in the process of merging. This low-mass system does not show a\nradio halo, however, we argue that the merger activates mechanisms that cause\nelectron re-acceleration in the large 800 kpc radio tail associated with\nIC~711. In the cluster Z7215 we discover diffuse radio emission at the cluster\ncenter, and we classify this emission as a radio halo, although it is dimmer\nand smaller than expected by the radio halo power versus cluster mass\ncorrelation. We suggest that the disturbed cluster Z7215 is in its post-merging\nphase. Systematic studies of this kind over a larger sample of clusters\nobserved with LoTSS will help constrain the time scales involved in turbulent\nre-acceleration and the subsequent energy losses of the underlying electrons. \n\n"}

Depending on their heating mechanism, the optical jet bullets\nmay serve as a probe of the collimated radiation coming from the inner region\nclose to the compact object. The optical interferometer VLTI/GRAVITY has\nallowed to spatially resolved the optical jets in SS 433 for the first time.

GRAVITY reveals elongated\nexponential-like spatial profiles for the optical jets, suggestive of a heating\nmechanism acting throughout a long portion of the jet and naturally explained\nby photoionization by the collimated radiation. We also spatially resolve the\nmovement of the optical bullets for the first time, detecting extended jet\ncomponents corresponding to previous ejections. \\texttt{Cloudy} photoionization\nmodels explain both the spatial intensity profiles measured with GRAVITY and\nthe line ratios from XSHOOTER, and constrain the properties of the optical\nbullets and the ionizing radiation.

Understanding the progenitors and the\nmechanism driving SN Ic-bl explosions vs those of their SNe Ic cousins is key\nto understanding the SN-GRB relationship and jet production in massive stars.\nHere we present the largest set of host-galaxy spectra of 28 SNe Ic and 14 SN\nIc-bl, all discovered before 2013 by the same untargeted survey, namely the\nPalomar Transient Factory (PTF). We carefully measure their gas-phase\nmetallicities, stellar masses (M*s) and star-formation rates (SFRs) by taking\ninto account recent progress in the metallicity field and propagating\nuncertainties correctly. We further re-analyze the hosts of 10 literature\nSN-GRBs using the same methods and compare them to our PTF SN hosts with the\ngoal of constraining their progenitors from their local environments by\nconducting a thorough statistical comparison, including upper limits. We find\nthat the metallicities, SFRs and M*s of our PTF SN Ic-bl hosts are\nstatistically comparable to those of SN-GRBs, but significantly lower than\nthose of the PTF SNe Ic. The mass-metallicity relations as defined by the SNe\nIc-bl and SN-GRBs are not significantly different from the same relations as\ndefined by the SDSS galaxies, in contrast to claims by earlier works. Our\nfindings point towards low metallicity as a crucial ingredient for SN Ic-bl and\nSN-GRB production since we are able to break the degeneracy between high SFR\nand low metallicity. We suggest that the PTF SNe Ic-bl may have produced jets\nthat were choked inside the star or were able break out of the star as unseen\nlow-luminosity or off-axis GRBs. \n\n"}

Abstract: Mass accretion rate is a key parameter in accretion disk theory. It\ndetermines black hole accretion mode. In large scale cosmological simulations\nstudying galaxy formation and evolution, Bondi radius can at most be marginally\nresolved. In those simulations, Bondi accretion formula is always used to\nestimate black hole accretion rate. Bondi solution is too simple, which cannot\nrepresent the real accretion process. We perform simulations of hot accretion\nflow at parsec scale irradiated by a low luminosity active galactic nucleus\n(AGN). We perform 77 simulations with varying density and temperature at outer\nboundary (10 parsec). Our purpose is to find a formula to calculate real black\nhole accretion rate based on the gas density and temperature at parsec scale.\nWe define Eddington accretion rate to be $\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}=10L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$,\nwith $L_{\\rm Edd}$ and $c$ been Eddington luminosity and speed of light\nrespectively. We set black hole mass to be $10^8M_{\\odot}$, $M_{\\odot}$ is\nsolar mass. We find that black hole accretion rate can be expressed as\n$\\frac{\\dot M_{\\rm BH} }{\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}}=10^{-3.11} (\\rho_0/10^{-22}{\\rm g\ncm}^{-3})^{1.36} (T_0/10^7 {\\rm K})^{-1.9}$, with $\\rho_0$ and $T_0$ being\ndensity and temperature at parsec scale, respectively. We find the formula can\naccurately predict the luminosity of observed low-luminosity AGNs (with black\nhole mass $\\sim 10^8M_{\\odot}$). This formula can be used in the sub-grid\nmodels in large scale cosmological simulations with a black hole mass of $\\sim\n10^8M_{\\odot}$. \n\n"}

Here, we\nrevisit the correlation relating the instantaneous flux, $F$, and the photon\nindex below the spectral break, $\\alpha$, in individual emission pulses, by\nstudying the 38 most prominent pulses in the Fermi/GBM GRB catalogue. First, we\nsearch for signatures of the bias in the determination of $\\alpha$ due to the\nlimited spectral coverage (window effect) expected in the synchrotron case. The\nabsence of such a characteristic signature argues against the simplest\nsynchrotron models. We instead find that the observed correlation between $F$\nand $\\alpha$ can, in general, be described by the relation $F(t) \\propto {\\rm\ne}^{k\\,\\alpha(t)}$, for which the median $k = 3$. We suggest that this\ncorrelation is a manifestation of subphotospheric heating in a flow with a\nvarying entropy. Around the peak of the light curve, a large entropy causes the\nphotosphere to approach the saturation radius, leading to an intense emission\nwith a narrow spectrum. As the entropy decreases the photosphere secedes from\nthe saturation radius, and weaker emission with a broader spectrum is expected.\nThis simple scenario naturally leads to a correlated variation of the intensity\nand spectral shape, covering the observed range. \n\n"}

{"id": "1901.03717", "contents": "Title: Tidal disruption events: the role of stellar spin Abstract: The tidal force from a supermassive black hole can rip apart a star that\npasses close enough in what is known as a Tidal Disruption Event. Typically\nhalf of the destroyed star remains bound to the black hole and falls back on\nhighly eccentric orbits, forming an accretion flow which powers a luminous\nflare. In this paper we use analytical and numerical calculations to explore\nthe effect of stellar rotation on the fallback rate of material. We find that\nslowly spinning stars ($\\Omega_* \\lesssim 0.01 \\Omega_{\\rm{breakup}}$) provide\nonly a small perturbation to fallback rates found in the non-spinning case.\nHowever when the star spins faster, there can be significant effects. If the\nstar is spinning retrograde with respect to its orbit the tidal force from the\nblack hole has to spin down the star first before disrupting it, causing\ndelayed and sometimes only partial disruption events. However, if the star is\nspinning prograde this works with the tidal force and the material falls back\nsooner and with a higher peak rate. We examine the power-law index of the\nfallback curves, finding that in all cases the fallback rate overshoots the\ncanonical $t^{-5/3}$ rate briefly after the peak, with the depth of the\novershoot dependent on the stellar spin. We also find that in general the late\ntime evolution is slightly flatter than the canonical $t^{-5/3}$ rate. We\ntherefore conclude that considering the spin of the star may be important in\nmodelling observed TDE lightcurves. \n\n"}

The leading theory postulates that this\nGeV excess is the aggregate emission from a large number of faint millisecond\npulsars (MSPs). The electrons and positrons ($e^\\pm$) injected by this\npopulation could produce detectable inverse-Compton (IC) emissions by\nup-scattering ambient photons to gamma-ray energies. In this work, we calculate\nsuch IC emissions using GALPROP. A triaxial three-dimensional model of the\nbulge stars obtained from a fit to infrared data is used as a tracer of the\nputative MSP population. This model is compared against one in which the MSPs\nare spatially distributed as a Navarro-Frenk-White squared profile.
