The free energies of the two thermal systems are\nfunctions of three independent state variables, and we find a similarity of our\ntwo thermal systems with the magnetized gas in laboratory, which gives us a\nphysical understanding of the necessity of three independent state variables.\nThen, via the thermodynamic consistency with three independent state variables,\nthe breakdown of entropy-area law for CEH is suggested. The validity of the law\nfor BEH can not be judged, but we clarify the key issue for BEH's entropy.\nFinally we make comments which may suggest the breakdown of entropy-area law\nfor BEH, and also propose two discussions; one of them is on the quantum\nstatistics of underlying quantum gravity, and another is on the SdS black hole\nevaporation from the point of view of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. \n\n"}

This\nspin-spin misalignment requires that the origin of most of B's present-day spin\nis connected to the supernova that formed pulsar B. Under the simplified\nassumption of a single, instantaneous kick during the supernova, the spin could\nbe thought of as originating from the off-center nature of the kick, causing\npulsar B to tumble to its misaligned state. With this assumption, and using\ncurrent constraints on the kick magnitude, we find that pulsar B's\ninstantaneous kick must have been displaced from the center of mass of the\nexploding star by at least 1 km and probably 5--10 km. Regardless of the\ndetails of the kick mechanism and the process that produced pulsar B's current\nspin, the measured spin-spin misalignment in the double pulsar system provides\nan empirical, direct constraint on the angular momentum production in this\nsupernova. This constraint can be used to guide core-collapse simulations and\nthe quest for understanding the spins and kicks of compact objects. \n\n"}

The distance to the source,\nits transient nature, and high internal column density serve to complicate\nseveral means of estimating the mass of the black hole. Utilizing newly-refined\nrelationships between black hole mass, radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity,\nand de-beaming the source flux, a weak constraint on the black hole mass is\nobtained: log(M/Msun) = 5.5 +/- 1.1 (1 sigma confidence). The confidence\ninterval is determined from the current intrinsic scatter in the relation,\nwhich includes effects from X-ray variability and accretion modes. This mass\nrange is broad, but it includes low values that are consistent with some\nvariability arguments, and it safely excludes high mass values where it becomes\nimpossible for black holes to disrupt stars.

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio. This method in principle can also be applied to any accreting\ncompact objects with detectable accretion disk wind absorption line features. \n\n"}

This leads to the fact that scalar radiation is emitted\nfrom a binary containing at least one BH. In this letter, we find the\nconstraints on this theory from BH low-mass X-ray binaries (BH-LMXBs). The main\nresult of this letter is that from the orbital decay rate of A0620-00, we\nobtained a conservative bound that is six orders of magnitude stronger than the\nsolar system bound. In addition to this, we look at XTE J1118+480, whose\norbital decay rate has been recently measured with an excess compared to the\ntheoretical prediction in GR due to the radiation reaction. The cause of this\nexcess is currently unknown. Although it is likely that the cause is of\nastrophysical origin, here we investigate the possibility of explaining this\nexcess with the additional scalar radiation in sGB theory. We find that there\nstill remains a parameter range where the excess can be explained while also\nsatisfying the constraint obtained from A0620-00. The interesting point is that\nfor most of other alternative theories of gravity, it seems difficult to\nexplain this excess with the additional radiation. This is because it would be\ndifficult to evade the constraints from binary pulsars or they have already\nbeen constrained rather strongly from other observations such as solar system\nexperiments. We propose several ways to determine whether the excess is caused\nby the scalar radiation in sGB gravity including future gravitational wave\nobservations with space-borne interferometers, which can give a constraint\nthree orders of magnitude stronger than that from A0620-00. \n\n"}

The long-duration gravitational-waveforms emitted\nby such systems encode the structure of the strong field region of the massive\nblack hole, in which the inspiral occurs. The detection and analysis of EMRIs\nwill therefore allow us to study the geometry of massive black holes and\ndetermine whether their nature is as predicted by General Relativity and even\nto test whether General Relativity is the correct theory to describe the\ndynamics of these systems. To achieve this, EMRI modeling in alternative\ntheories of gravity is required to describe the generation of gravitational\nwaves. In this paper, we explore to what extent EMRI observations with LISA or\neLISA/NGO might be able to distinguish between General Relativity and a\nparticular modification of it, known as Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified\nGravity.

In order to confirm the Kerr-nature of these\nobjects, we need to probe the geometry of the space-time around them and see if\nthe observations are consistent with the predictions of the Kerr metric. That\ncan be achieved, for instance, by studying the properties of the\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by the gas in the accretion disk. The\nhigh-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in the X-ray flux of some\nstellar-mass black hole candidates might do the job. As the frequencies of\nthese oscillations depend only very weakly on the observed X-ray flux, it is\nthought they are mainly determined by the metric of the space-time. In this\npaper, I consider the resonance models proposed by Abramowicz and Kluzniak and\nI extend previous results to the case of non-Kerr space-times. The emerging\npicture is more complicated than the one around a Kerr black hole and there is\na larger number of possible combinations between different modes.

Our results show that: (i) post-Newtonian effects cause\na small reduction in the GW background signal; (ii) below 100 Hz the background\ndepends primarily on the local coalescence rate $r_0$ and the average chirp\nmass and is independent of the chirp mass distribution; (iii) the effects of\ncosmic star formation rates and delay times between the formation and merger of\nbinaries are linear below 100 Hz and can be represented by a single parameter\nwithin a factor of ~ 2; (iv) a simple power law model of the energy density\nparameter $\\Omega_{GW}(f) ~ f^{2/3}$ up to 50-100 Hz is sufficient to be used\nas a search template for ground-based interferometers. In terms of the\ndetection prospects of the background signal, we show that: (i) detection (a\nsignal-to-noise ratio of 3) within one year of observation by the Advanced LIGO\ndetectors (H1-L1) requires a coalescence rate of $r_0 = 3 (0.2) Mpc^{-3}\nMyr^{-1}$ for binary neutron stars (binary black holes); (ii) this limit on\n$r_0$ could be reduced 3-fold for two co-located detectors, whereas the\ncurrently proposed worldwide network of advanced instruments gives only ~ 30%\nimprovement in detectability; (iii) the improved sensitivity of the planned\nEinstein Telescope allows not only confident detection of the background but\nalso the high frequency components of the spectrum to be measured.

In this paper we focus on the systematic\nbiases that would result from using them to estimate binary parameters, and\nconsider a one-parameter family of configurations at one choice of mass ratio\nand effective single spin. We find that for low-mass binaries within that\nfamily of configurations, where the observable waveform is dominated by the\ninspiral, the systematic bias in all physical parameters is smaller than the\nparameter uncertainty due to degeneracies between the mass ratio and the spins,\nat least up to signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 50. For higher-mass binaries,\nwhere the merger and ringdown make a greater contribution to the observed\nsignal, the bias in the mass ratio is comparable to its uncertainty at SNRs of\nonly $\\sim$30, and the bias in the measurement of the total spin is\n\\emph{larger} than the uncertainty defined by the 90% confidence region even at\nan SNR of only 10. Although this bias may be mitigated in future models by a\nbetter choice of single-effective-spin parameter, these results suggest that it\nmay be possible to accurately measure \\emph{both} black-hole spins in\nintermediate-mass binaries. \n\n"}

Among\npossible EM emission from the NS merger, emission powered by radioactive\nr-process nuclei is one of the best targets for follow-up observations.\nHowever, prediction so far does not take into account detailed r-process\nelement abundances in the ejecta.

We show that the opacity in the NS merger ejecta is about kappa =\n10 cm^2 g^{-1}, which is higher than that of Fe-rich Type Ia supernova ejecta\nby a factor of ~ 100. As a result, the emission is fainter and longer than\npreviously expected. The spectra are almost featureless due to the high\nexpansion velocity and bound-bound transitions of many different r-process\nelements.

The templates map the waveform shapes to physical\nparameters, thus allowing us to produce posterior probability distributions for\nthese parameters.

If strong field gravity is not accurately described\nby General Relativity (GR), then using GR templates may result in fundamental\nbias in the recovered parameters, or even worse, a complete failure to detect\nsignals.

First, we show that there exist modified theories compatible\nwith all existing tests that would fail to be detected by the LIGO/Virgo\nnetwork using searches based on GR templates, but which would be detected using\na one parameter post-Einsteinian extension. Second, we study modified theories\nthat produce departures from GR that turn on suddenly at a critical frequency,\nproducing waveforms that do not naively fit into the simplest parameterized\npost-Einsteinian (ppE) scheme.

Using a large number of accurate\nnumerical-relativity simulations of binaries with nuclear equations of state,\nwe find that the postmerger emission is characterized by two distinct and\nrobust spectral features. While the high-frequency peak has already been\nassociated with the oscillations of the hypermassive neutron star produced by\nthe merger and depends on the equation of state, a new correlation emerges\nbetween the low-frequency peak, related to the merger process, and the total\ncompactness of the stars in the binary.

If the mass of the binary is known from the inspiral\nsignal, the combined use of the two frequency peaks sets four simultaneous\nconstraints to be satisfied. Ideally, even a single detection would be\nsufficient to select one equation of state over the others.

I: Stellar mass at z<1 Abstract: LGRBs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to star\nformation. The conditions necessary to produce LGRBs can affect the relation\nbetween the LGRB rate and star formation. By using the power of a complete LGRB\nsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,\nwhat is its origin. In this first paper, we build the SED of the z<1 host\ngalaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample, and determine their stellar masses from SED\nfitting. We compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) with\nstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA); (ii) with\nsemi-analitical models of the z<1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) with\nnumerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for\nthe progenitor star environment. We find that at z<1 LGRBs tend to avoid\nmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forming\ngalaxies. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with\nthat of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted for their SFR. This\nimplies that, at least at z<1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star\nformation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-end\nof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow SFR-Mass relation for\nthe low mass galaxy population. GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to\nreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order\nof Z_th=0.3-0.5Z_sun is necessary. Models without a metallicity threshold or\nwith an extreme threshold of Z_th = 0.1Z_sun are excluded at z<1. The use of\nthe BAT6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biases\nwhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples.

We find that, depending on\nthe ST parameters, the number of GW cycles can be substantially smaller than in\nGR. In particular, we obtain that when dynamical scalarization sets in around a\nGW frequency of ~130 Hz, the sole inclusion of the ST binding energy causes a\nreduction of GW cycles from ~120 Hz up to the end of the sequence (~1200 Hz) of\n~11% with respect to the GR case.

It has been speculated that such outflows hinder star formation (SF) in\ntheir host galaxies, providing a form of feedback to the process of galaxy\nformation. Previous studies, however, indicated that only jets from extremely\nrare, high power quasars or radio galaxies could impart significant feedback on\ntheir hosts. Here we present detailed observations of the gas and dust\ncontinuum of NGC1266 at millimeter wavelengths. Our observations show that\nmolecular gas is being driven out of the nuclear region at $\\dot{M}_{\\rm out}\n\\approx 110 M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, of which the vast majority cannot escape the\nnucleus. Only 2 $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is actually capable of escaping the galaxy.\nMost of the molecular gas that remains is very inefficient at forming stars.\nThe far-infrared emission is dominated by an ultra-compact ($\\lesssim50$pc)\nsource that could either be powered by an AGN or by an ultra-compact starburst.\nThe ratio of the SF surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$) to the gas surface\ndensity ($\\Sigma_{\\rm H_2}$) indicates that SF is suppressed by a factor of\n$\\approx 50$ compared to normal star-forming galaxies if all gas is forming\nstars, and $\\approx$150 for the outskirt (98%) dense molecular gas if the\ncentral region is is powered by an ultra-compact starburst. The AGN-driven bulk\noutflow could account for this extreme suppression by hindering the\nfragmentation and gravitational collapse necessary to form stars through a\nprocess of turbulent injection. This result suggests that even relatively\ncommon, low-power AGNs are able to alter the evolution of their host galaxies\nas their black holes grow onto the M-$\\sigma$ relation. \n\n"}

Anisotropy is known to affect the\nbulk properties of nonrotating neutron stars in General Relativity.

Our\nsimulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the\nefficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization\nif radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams\nself-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the\nintersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a\ngeometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring\nrapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a\ngeometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is\nefficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and\nforms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated\nenergy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the\nsubsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to\n~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find\nthat a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced\ncircularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning\nblack hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably\nlong in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black\nhole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important\nnodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the\nother hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in\nthe radiatively inefficient case. We also discuss the relationship between our\nsimulations and the parabolic TDEs that are characteristic of most stellar\ntidal disruptions. \n\n"}

Phenomenological models of\ntiming noise, such as from superfluid turbulence, suggest that the timing noise\nspectrum plateaus below some critical frequency, $f_c$, potentially aiding the\nhunt for gravitational waves.

In this\npaper, we present and discuss the mass spectrum of compact remnants that we\nobtained with SEVN, a new public population-synthesis code, which couples the\nPARSEC stellar evolution tracks with up-to-date recipes for SN explosion\n(depending on the Carbon-Oxygen mass of the progenitor, on the compactness of\nthe stellar core at pre-SN stage, and on a recent two-parameter criterion based\non the dimensionless entropy per nucleon at pre-SN stage). SEVN can be used\nboth as a stand-alone code and in combination with direct-summation N-body\ncodes (Starlab, HiGPUs). The PARSEC stellar evolution tracks currently\nimplemented in SEVN predict significantly larger values of the Carbon-Oxygen\ncore mass with respect to previous models.

We study\nwhether gravitational wave observations of neutron star binaries in\nquasicircular inspirals will allow us to distinguish between equations of state\nof differing internal composition, thereby providing important information\nabout the properties of extremely high density matter. We carry out a Bayesian\nmodel selection analysis, and find that second generation gravitational wave\ndetectors can heavily constrain equations of state that contain only quark\nmatter, but hybrid stars containing both normal and quark matter are harder to\ndistinguish from normal matter stars.

In such an\nenvironment, the disc evolution may differ significantly from ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic predictions. We present non-ideal global axisymmetric\nsimulations of geometrically thick discs around a rotating black hole. The\nsimulations are carried out using a new code ${\\rm\\it grim}$, which evolves a\ncovariant extended magnetohydrodynamics model derived by treating non-ideal\neffects as a perturbation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Non-ideal effects are\nmodeled through heat conduction along magnetic field lines, and a difference\nbetween the pressure parallel and perpendicular to the field lines. The model\nrelies on an effective collisionality in the disc from wave-particle scattering\nand velocity-space (mirror and firehose) instabilities. We find that the\npressure anisotropy grows to match the magnetic pressure, at which point it\nsaturates due to the mirror instability. The pressure anisotropy produces\noutward angular momentum transport with a magnitude comparable to that of MHD\nturbulence in the disc, and a significant increase in the temperature in the\nwall of the jet. We also find that, at least in our axisymmetric simulations,\nconduction has a small effect on the disc evolution because (1) the heat flux\nis constrained to be parallel to the field and the field is close to\nperpendicular to temperature gradients, and (2) the heat flux is choked by an\nincrease in effective collisionality associated with the mirror instability. \n\n"}

The setup\ntherein, however, considered the light source to be a celestial sphere\nsufficiently far away from the BH. Here, we analyse KBHsSH surrounded by an\nemitting torus of matter, simulating a more realistic astrophysical\nenvironment, and study the corresponding lensing of light as seen by a very far\naway observer, to appropriately model ground-based observations of Sgr A*. We\nfind that the differences in imaging between KBHsSH and comparable vacuum Kerr\nBHs remain, albeit less dramatic than those observed for the corresponding\nshadows in the previous setup.

With masses of ~10^7M_Sun\nand sizes of only a few parsecs, nuclear star clusters are the densest stellar\nsystems observed in the local universe and represent a robust environment where\n(stellar mass) black hole binaries can dynamically form, harden and merge. We\nshow that due to their large escape speeds, nuclear star clusters can keep a\nlarge fraction of their merger remnants while also evolving rapidly enough that\nthe holes can sink back to the central regions where they can swap in new\nbinaries that can subsequently harden and merge. This process can repeat\nseveral times and produce black hole mergers of several tens of solar masses\nsimilar to GW150914 and up to a few hundreds of solar masses, without the need\nof invoking extremely low metallicity environments or implausible initial\nconditions.

Some of\nthis uncertainty may be removed through future gravitational wave observations\nof neutron star binaries by extracting the tidal deformabilities (or Love\nnumbers) of neutron stars. Previous studies showed that only a certain\ncombination of the individual deformabilities of each body (chirp tidal\ndeformability) can be measured with second-generation gravitational wave\ninterferometers, such as Adv. LIGO, due to correlations between the individual\ndeformabilities. To overcome this, we search for approximately universal (or\nequation-of-state independent) relations between two combinations of the\nindividual tidal deformabilities, such that once one of them has been measured,\nthe other can be automatically obtained and the individual ones decoupled\nthrough these relations. We find an approximately universal relation between\nthe symmetric and the anti-symmetric combination of the individual tidal\ndeformabilities that is equation-of-state-insensitive to $20\\%$ for binaries\nwith masses less than $1.7M_\\odot$. We show that these relations can be used to\neliminate a combination of the tidal parameters from the list of model\nparameters, thus breaking degeneracies and improving the accuracy in parameter\nestimation. A simple study shows that the universal relations can improve the\naccuracy in the extraction of the symmetric combination of tidal parameters by\nas much as an order of magnitude, making the overall accuracy in the extraction\nof this parameter slightly better than that of the chirp tidal deformability.\nThese new universal relations and the improved measurement accuracy on tidal\nparameters not only are important to astrophysics and nuclear physics, but also\nimpact our ability to probe extreme gravity with gravitational waves and\ncosmology. \n\n"}

The spirit\nof the test lies in the \"no-hair\" conjecture for black holes where all\nproperties of a black hole are characterised by the mass and the spin of the\nblack hole. The method relies on observationally measuring the quadrupole\nmoments of the compact binary constituents induced due to their spins.

Otherwise, the quadrupole moment can\ndepend on additional parameters (such as equation of state of the object).

Recently, however, the hypothesis that the BH\ninterior does not exist has been gaining traction, as it provides a means for\nresolving the BH information-loss problem. Here, we propose a simple method for\nanswering the following question: Does the BH interior exist and, if so, does\nit contain some distribution of matter or is it mostly empty? Our proposal is\npremised on the idea that, similar to the case of relativistic, ultra-compact\nstars, any BH-like object whose interior has some matter distribution should\nsupport fluid modes in addition to the conventional spacetime modes. In\nparticular, the Coriolis-induced Rossby (r-) modes, whose spectrum is mostly\ninsensitive to the composition of the interior matter, should be a universal\nfeature of such BH-like objects. In fact, the frequency and damping time of\nthese modes are determined by only the object's mass and speed of rotation. The\nr-modes oscillate at a lower frequency, decay at a slower rate and produce\nweaker GWs than do modes of the spacetime class. Hence, they imprint a\nmodel-insensitive signature of a non-empty interior in the GW spectrum\nresulting from a BH merger.

This resonant tide can induce phase shift in the\ngravitational waveforms, and potentially provide a new window of studying NS\ninterior using gravitational waves. Previous works have considered tidal\nexcitations of pure g-modes (due to stable stratification of the star) and pure\ninertial modes (due to Coriolis force), with the rotational effect treated in\nan approximate manner. However, for realistic NSs, the buoyancy and rotational\neffects can be comparable, giving rise to mixed inertial-gravity modes. We\ndevelop a non-perturbative numerical spectral code to compute the frequencies\nand tidal coupling coefficients of these modes. We then calculate the phase\nshift in the gravitational waveform due to each resonance during binary\ninspiral. We adopt polytropic NS models with a parameterized stratification. We\nderive relevant scaling relations and survey how the phase shift depends on\nvarious properties of the NS. We find that for canonical NSs (with mass M =\n1.4M_sun and radius R = 10 km) and modest rotation rates (< 300 Hz), the\ngravitational wave phase shift due to a resonance is generally less than 0.01\nradian.

The goal of this paper is to test these relations with extreme\nequations of state at supranuclear densities constrained to satisfy only a\nhandful of generic, physically sensible conditions. By requiring that the\nequation of state be (i) barotropic and (ii) its associated speed of sound be\nreal, we construct a piecewise function that matches a tabulated equation of\nstate at low densities, while matching a stiff equation of state parametrized\nby its sound speed in the high-density region. We show that the I-Love-Q\nrelations hold to 1 percent with this class of equations of state, even in the\nextreme case where the speed of sound becomes superluminal and independently of\nthe transition density. We also find further support for the interpretation of\nthe I-Love-Q relations as an emergent symmetry due to the nearly constant\neccentricity of isodensity contours inside the star. These results reinforce\nthe robustness of the I-Love-Q relations against our current incomplete picture\nof physics at supranuclear densities, while strengthening our confidence in the\napplicability of these relations in neutron star astrophysics. \n\n"}

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from coalescing binary neutron stars\nrepresents another milestone in gravitational-wave astronomy.

We review a few astrophysical channels\nthat might produce black holes below 3 $M_{\\odot}$ (roughly the upper bound on\nthe maximum mass of a neutron star), as well as existing constraints for these\nchannels.

However, it is essential that the General Relativity sector of\nthese templates accounts for all predictable physics. Otherwise, missing\nphysics might be mimicked by the \"beyond General Relativity\" sector of the\ntemplates, leading the analysis to report apparent deviations from General\nRelativity. Current parametrized tests implement templates that omit physical\nphenomena such as orbital eccentricity and higher-order modes. In this paper,\nwe show how the omission of higher modes can lead to false deviations from\nGeneral Relativity when these effects are strong enough.

We also assume that the two stars\nhave the same equation of state; we demonstrate that for stars with masses\ncomparable to the component masses of GW170817, this is effectively implemented\nby assuming that the stars' dimensionless tidal deformabilities are determined\nby the binary's mass ratio $q$ by $\\Lambda_1/\\Lambda_2 = q^6$. We investigate\ndifferent choices of prior on the component masses of the neutron stars.

The magnitude and precise direction of this\n\"gravitational Magnus effect\" is still the subject of debate. Starting from the\nrigorous equations of motion for spinning bodies in General Relativity\n(Mathisson-Papapetrou equations), we show that indeed such an effect takes\nplace and is a fundamental part of the spin-curvature force. The effect arises\nwhenever there is a current of mass/energy, non-parallel to a body's spin.

PDS 456\nhad a low X-ray flux compared to past observations, where the first of the two\nnew XMM-Newton observations occurred during a pronounced dip in the X-ray\nlightcurve. The broad-band X-ray spectrum is highly absorbed, attenuated by a\nsoft X-ray absorber of column density $N_{\\rm H}=6\\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. An\nincrease in obscuration occurs during the dip, which may be due to an X-ray\neclipse. In addition, the persistent, fast Fe K outflow is present, with\nvelocity components of $-0.25c$ and $-0.4c$. The soft absorber is less ionized\n($\\log\\xi=3$) compared to the iron K outflow ($\\log\\xi=5$) and is outflowing\nwith a velocity of approximately $-0.2c$. A soft X-ray excess is present below\n1 keV against the highly absorbed continuum and can be attributed to the\nre-emission from a wide angle wind.

These orbits are of special interest for forthcoming\nLIGO/VIRGO/GEO gravitational wave observations.

The tidal work done on the star through this driving has an effect on\nthe evolution of the inspiral and on the phasing of the emitted gravitational\nwave signal. For a neutron star of mass M, radius R, spin frequency f_spin,\nmodeled as a Gamma =2 polytrope, with a companion also of mass M, the\ngravitational wave phase shift for the m=2 mode is\n(0.1radians)(R/10km)^4(M/1.4M_sun)^{-10/3}(f_spin/100Hz)^{2/3} for optimal spin\norientation.

Our analysis is based\non the method of matched asymptotic expansions and is valid to all orders in\nthe strength of internal gravity in each star, but is perturbative in the\n``tidal expansion parameter'' (stellar radius)/(orbital separation). At first\norder in the tidal expansion parameter, we show that the internal structure of\neach star is unaffected by its companion, in agreement with post-1-Newtonian\nresults of Wiseman (gr-qc/9704018). We also show that relativistic interactions\nthat scale as higher powers of the tidal expansion parameter produce\nqualitatively similar effects to their Newtonian counterparts: there are\ncorrections to the Newtonian tidal distortion of each star, both of which occur\nat third order in the tidal expansion parameter, and there are corrections to\nthe Newtonian decrease in central density of each star (Newtonian ``tidal\nstabilization''), both of which are sixth order in the tidal expansion\nparameter. There are additional interactions with no Newtonian analogs, but\nthese do not change the central density of each star up to sixth order in the\ntidal expansion parameter. These results, in combination with previous analyses\nof Newtonian tidal interactions, indicate that (i) there are no large\ngeneral-relativistic crushing forces that could cause the stars to collapse to\nblack holes prior to the dynamical orbital instability, and (ii) the\nconventional wisdom with respect to coalescing binary neutron stars as sources\nof gravitational-wave bursts is correct: namely, the finite-stellar-size\ncorrections to the gravitational waveform will be unimportant for the purpose\nof detecting the coalescences. \n\n"}

In the case of\ninspiralling compact binaries, gravitational waves emitted at low frequency\nearly in the inspiral will travel slightly slower than those emitted at high\nfrequency later, modifying the phase evolution of the observed inspiral\ngravitational waveform, similar to that caused by post-Newtonian corrections to\nquadrupole phasing. Matched filtering of the waveforms can bound such\nfrequency-dependent variations in propagation speed, and thereby bound the\ngraviton mass. The bound depends on the mass of the source and on noise\ncharacteristics of the detector, but is independent of the distance to the\nsource, except for weak cosmological redshift effects.

The ``primary effect'' says that the extra matter can afford to be a\npart of source or whole source of the wormhole when the wormhole is being\nformed. Thus the matter does not affect the stability of wormhole and the\nwormhole is still safe. If the extra matter is extotic, it can be the whole\npart of the source of the wormhole.\n  The ``auxiliary effect'' is that the extra matter plays the role of the\nadditional matter to the stably-existed wormhole by the other exotic matter.\nThis additional matter will change the geometry of wormhole enough to prevent\nfrom forming the wormhole by backreaction. In the minimally coupled massless\nscalar field case, the self-consistent solution was found. The backreaction of\nthe scalar field can dominate the exotic matter part so that it will hinder the\nformation of the wormhole. \n\n"}
