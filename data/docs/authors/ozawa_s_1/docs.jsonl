Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors).

Developments in observations, theory, and instrumentation have\nprepared the way so that the next decade can be the one in which we finally\nanswer the question, \"What are gamma-ray bursts?\" This question encompasses not\nonly what the progenitors are that produce the GRBs, but also how the enormous\nluminosity of the GRBs, concentrated in gamma rays, is achieved.

The radio\nemitting relativistic particles and magnetic fields were probably seeded in the\npast by a pair of radio-jets originating in the AGN of the central cD galaxy.\nThe extremely steep high-frequency radio spectrum of the north-western bubble,\nlocated ~100 kpc from cluster centre, indicates radiation losses, possibly\nbecause having detached, it is rising buoyantly and moving away into the\nputative hot intra-cluster medium. The other bubble, closer to the cluster\ncentre, shows signs of ongoing particle re-acceleration. We estimate that the\nradio jets which inflated these two bubbles might have also fed enough energy\ninto the intra-cluster medium to create an enormous system of cavities and\nshock fronts, and to drive a massive outflow from the AGN, which could\ncounter-balance and even quench a cooling flow. Therefore, this source presents\nan excellent opportunity to understand the energetics and the dynamical\nevolution of radio-jet inflated plasma bubbles in the hot cluster atmosphere. \n\n"}

To date, central engine-driven SNe have been\ndiscovered exclusively through their gamma-ray emission, yet it is expected\nthat a larger population goes undetected due to limited satellite sensitivity\nor beaming of the collimated emission away from our line-of-sight. In this\nframework, the recovery of undetected GRBs may be possible through radio\nsearches for SNe Ibc with relativistic outflows.

We show that contrary\nto earlier indications the accumulated data speak against this possibility.\nAnother method would be to use correlation between a distance dependent and a\ndistance independent variable to measure distance and determine cosmological\nparameters as is done using Cepheid variables and to some extent Type Ia\nsupernovae.

We investigate\nthe evolution of this outburst with two-dimensional axisymmetric gasdynamical\ncalculations in which the cavities are inflated by relativistic cosmic rays.\nMany key observational features of the cavities and associated shocks are\nsuccessfully reproduced. The radial elongation of the cavities indicates that\ncosmic rays were injected into the cluster gas by a (jet) source moving out\nfrom the central AGN. AGN jets of this magnitude must be almost perfectly\nidentically bipolar. The relativistic momentum of a single jet would cause a\ncentral AGN black hole of mass 10^9 M_{sun} to recoil at ~6000 km s^{-1},\nexceeding kick velocities during black hole mergers, and be ejected from the\ncluster-center galaxy. When the cavity inflation is complete, 4PV\nunderestimates the total energy received by the cluster gas. Deviations of the\ncluster gas from hydrostatic equilibrium are most pronounced during the early\ncavity evolution when the integrated cluster mass found from the observed gas\npressure gradient can have systematic errors near the cavities of ~10-30%.

Substantial observational efforts have been\ndevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. the\ninitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.\nIn spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are still\nseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, their\nenergetics and the environment. Aim: Independently of specific gamma-ray burst\ntheoretical recipes, spectra in the GeV/TeV range are predicted to be\nremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and therefore\noffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background light\ndistribution. Furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-high\nenergies, i.e. at $\\sim 100$\\,GeV, would solve the ambiguity about the\nimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barely\ndistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. Methods: We used the results of\nthe MAGIC telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\\sim0.76$)\n\\object{GRB\\,080430} at energies above about 80\\,GeV, to evaluate the\nperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based GeV/TeV\ntelescopes.

We speculate that this\ntimescale is the same as that on which Ha emission is varying and is equal to\nthe rotation period of the star. The corresponding longitudinal magnetic field,\nmeasured during each of the three seasons, increases slowly from 100 to 150G,\nimplying that the polar strength of the putatively-dipolar large-scale magnetic\nfield of HD108 is at least 0.5kG and most likely of the order of 1-2 kG. The\nstellar and wind properties are derived through a quantitative spectroscopic\nanalysis with the code CMFGEN. The effective temperature is difficult to\nconstrain because of the unusually strong HeI4471 and HeI5876 lines. Values in\nthe range 33000-37000 K are preferred. A mass loss rate of about 1e-7 Msun/yr\n(with a clumping factor f=0.01) and a wind terminal velocity of 2000 km/s are\nderived. The wind confinement parameter eta_star is larger than 100, implying\nthat the wind of HD108 is magnetically confined. Stochastic short-term\nvariability is observed in the wind-sensitive lines but not in the photospheric\nlines, excluding the presence of pulsations. Material infall in the confined\nwind is the most likely origin for lines formed in the inner wind.\nWind-clumping also probably causes part of the Ha variability. The projected\nrotational velocity of HD108 is lower than 50 km/s, consistent with the\nspectroscopic and photometric variation timescales of a few decades. Overall,\nHD108 is very similar to the magnetic O star HD191612 except for an even slower\nrotation. \n\n"}

The\noscillatory motion is influenced by the strong interaction between the shear\nmodes of the crust and Alfven-like modes in the core. We study the dynamics\nwhich arises through this interaction, and present several new results: (1) We\nshow that global {\\it edge modes} frequently reside near the edges of the core\nAlfven continuum. (2) We compute the magnetar's oscillatory motion for\nrealistic axisymmetric magnetic field configurations and core density profiles,\nbut with a simplified model of the elastic crust. We show that one may\ngenerically get multiple gaps in the Alfven continuum. One obtains discrete\nglobal {\\it gap modes} if the crustal frequencies belong to the gaps. (3) We\nshow that field tangling in the core enhances the role of the core discrete\nAlfven modes and reduces the role of the core Alfven continuum in the overall\noscillatory dynamics of the magnetar. (4) We demonstrate that the system\ndisplays transient and/or drifting QPOs when parts of the spectrum of the core\nAlfven modes contain discrete modes which are densely and regularly spaced in\nfrequency. (5) We show that if the neutrons are coupled into the core Alfven\nmotion, then the post-flare crustal motion is strongly damped and has a very\nweak amplitude. Thus magnetar QPOs give evidence that the proton and neutron\ncomponents in the core are dynamically decoupled and that at least one of them\nis a quantum fluid. (6) We show that it is difficult to identify the\nhigh-frequency 625 Hz QPO as being due to the physical oscillatory mode of the\nmagnetar, if the latter's fluid core consists of the standard\nproton-neutron-electron mixture and is magnetised to the same extent as the\ncrust.

These pulses will reach\nEarth-based telescopes dispersed, and therefore reduced in amplitude, due to\ntheir propagation through the Earth's ionosphere. To maximise the received\nsignal to noise ratio and subsequent chances of pulse detection, ionospheric\ndispersion must therefore be corrected, and since the high time resolution\nwould require excessive data storage this correction must be made in real time.\nThis requires an accurate knowledge of the dispersion characteristic which is\nparameterised by the instantaneous Total Electron Content (TEC) of the\nionosphere.

As an attempt to discriminate among several possible\nproduction scenarios, astrophysicists try to test the statistical isotropy of\nthe directions of arrival of these cosmic rays. At the highest energies, they\nare supposed to point toward their sources with good accuracy. However, the\nobservations are so rare that testing the distribution of such samples of\ndirectional data on the sphere is nontrivial. In this paper, we choose a\nnonparametric framework that makes weak hypotheses on the alternative\ndistributions and allows in turn to detect various and possibly unexpected\nforms of anisotropy. We explore two particular procedures. Both are derived\nfrom fitting the empirical distribution with wavelet expansions of densities.\nWe use the wavelet frame introduced by [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 38 (2006b) 574-594\n(electronic)], the so-called needlets. The expansions are truncated at scale\nindices no larger than some ${J^{\\star}}$, and the $L^p$ distances between\nthose estimates and the null density are computed. One family of tests (called\nMultiple) is based on the idea of testing the distance from the null for each\nchoice of $J=1,\\ldots,{J^{\\star}}$, whereas the so-called PlugIn approach is\nbased on the single full ${J^{\\star}}$ expansion, but with thresholded wavelet\ncoefficients. We describe the practical implementation of these two procedures\nand compare them to other methods in the literature. As alternatives to\nisotropy, we consider both very simple toy models and more realistic\nnonisotropic models based on Physics-inspired simulations. The Monte Carlo\nstudy shows good performance of the Multiple test, even at moderate sample\nsize, for a wide sample of alternative hypotheses and for different choices of\nthe parameter ${J^{\\star}}$. On the 69 most energetic events published by the\nPierre Auger Collaboration, the needlet-based procedures suggest statistical\nevidence for anisotropy. Using several values for the parameters of the\nmethods, our procedures yield $p$-values below 1%, but with uncontrolled\nmultiplicity issues. The flexibility of this method and the possibility to\nmodify it to take into account a large variety of extensions of the problem\nmake it an interesting option for future investigation of the origin of\nultrahigh energy cosmic rays. \n\n"}

We\nfirst consider a collision between two test particles following the radial\ngeodesics in the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m naked singular geometry. An initially\nradially ingoing particle turns back due to the repulsive effect of gravity in\nthe vicinity of naked singularity. Such a particle then collides with an\nanother radially ingoing particle. We show that the center of mass energy of\ncollision taking place at $r \\approx M$ is unbound, in the limit where the\ncharge transcends the mass by arbitrarily small amount $0<1-M/Q\\ll1$.The\nacceleration process we described avoids fine tuning of the parameters of the\nparticle geodesics for the unbound center of mass energy of collisions and the\nproper time required for the process is also finite. We show that the\ncoordinate time required for the trans-Plankian collision to occur around one\nsolar mass naked singularity is around million years while it is many orders of\nmagnitude larger than Hubble time in the black hole case.

We find that the NS is\ntidally disrupted irrespective of the mass ratio when the BH has a moderately\nlarge prograde spin, whereas only binaries with low mass ratios, MBH/MNS <~ 3\nor small compactnesses of the NSs, bring the tidal disruption when the BH spin\nis zero or retrograde.

Suzaku found the source in a minimum flux level;\na comparison with the XMM-Newton data implies an increase of a factor of 2.5 in\nthe 0.5-10 keV flux, in the 6 months separating the two observations. The iron\nK complex is detected in both datasets, with rather low equivalent width(s).\nThe intensity of the iron K complex does not respond to the change in continuum\nflux. An ultra-fast, high-ionization outflowing gas is clearly detected in the\nXIS data; the absorber is most likely unstable. Indeed, during the XMM-Newton\nobservation, which was 6 months after, the absorber was not detected. No clear\nroll-over in the hard X-ray emission is detected, probably due to the emergence\nof the jet as a dominant component in the hard X-ray band, as suggested by the\ndetection above ~ 100 keV with the GSO on-board Suzaku, although the present\ndata do not allow us to firmly constrain the relative contribution of the\ndifferent components.

The SN had a peak\nluminosity, M_R ~ -20.2 mag, significantly more luminous than known GRB-SNe and\none of the most luminous SNe Ib/c ever discovered. The absorption velocity of\nSN 2010ay is v_Si ~ 19,000 km/s at ~40 days after explosion, 2-5 times higher\nthan other broad-lined SNe and similar to the GRB-SN 2010bh at comparable\nepochs. Moreover, the velocity declines ~2 times slower than other SNe Ic-BL\nand GRB-SNe. Assuming that the optical emission is powered by radioactive\ndecay, the peak magnitude implies the synthesis of an unusually large mass of\n56 Ni, M_Ni = 0.9 M_solar.

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio.

In order to constrain the\nflux-dependent accretion geometry of this source over wider energy bands than\nemployed in most of previous works, the present study utilized two out of the\nseven data sets.

An important question is\nwhether the distribution of arrival directions for such UHECR nuclei can\nexhibit observable anisotropy or positional correlations with their\nastrophysical source objects despite the expected strong deflections by\nintervening magnetic fields. For this purpose, we have simulated the\npropagation of UHECR nuclei including models for both the extragalactic\nmagnetic field and the Galactic magnetic field. Assuming that only iron nuclei\nare injected steadily from sources with equal luminosity and spatially\ndistributed according to the observed large scale structure in the local\nUniverse, at the number of events published by the PAO so far, the arrival\ndistribution of UHECRs would be consistent with no auto-correlation at 95%\nconfidence if the mean number density of UHECR sources $n_s >~ 10^{-6}$\nMpc$^{-3}$, and consistent with no cross-correlation with sources within 95%\nerrors for $n_s >~ 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. On the other hand, with 1000 events\nabove $5.5 \\times 10^{19}$ eV in the whole sky, next generation experiments can\nreveal auto-correlation with more than 99% probability even for $n_s <~\n10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, and cross-correlation with sources with more than 99%\nprobability for $n_s <~ 10^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. In addition, we find that the\ncontribution of Centaurus A is required to reproduce the currently observed\nUHECR excess in the Centaurus region. Secondary protons generated by\nphotodisintegration of primary heavy nuclei during propagation play a crucial\nrole in all cases, and the resulting anisotropy at small angular scales should\nprovide a strong hint of the source location if the maximum energies of the\nheavy nuclei are sufficiently high. \n\n"}

We introduce a novel method of data randomization to evaluate\nquantitatively the effect of these biases and to assess the intrinsic\nsignificance of an apparent correlation between radio and gamma-ray flux\ndensities of blazars. The novelty of the method lies in a combination of data\nrandomization in luminosity space (to ensure that the randomized data are\nintrinsically, and not just apparently, uncorrelated) and significance\nassessment in flux space (to explicitly avoid Malmquist bias and automatically\naccount for the limited dynamical range in both frequencies).

We examine steady-state\nconfigurations of the disk and migrating SMBH system, self-consistently\naccounting for tidal and viscous torques and heating, radiative diffusion\nlimited cooling, gas and radiation pressure, and the decay of the binary's\norbit. We obtain a \"phase diagram\" of the system as a function of binary\nparameters, showing regimes in which both the disk structure and migration have\na different character. Although massive binaries can create a central gap in\nthe disk at large radii, the tidal barrier of the secondary causes a\nsignificant pile-up of gas outside of its orbit, which can lead to the closing\nof the gap. We find that this spillover occurs at an orbital separation as\nlarge as ~200 M_7^{-1/2} gravitational radii, where M = 10^7 M_7 Msun is the\ntotal binary mass. If the secondary is less massive than ~10^6 Msun, then the\ngap is closed before gravitational waves (GWs) start dominating the orbital\ndecay. In this regime, the disk is still strongly perturbed, but the piled-up\ngas continuously overflows as in a porous dam, and crosses inside the\nsecondary's orbit. The corresponding migration rate, which we label Type 1.5,\nis slower than the usual limiting cases known as Type I and II migration.\nCompared to an unperturbed disk, the steady-state disk in the overflowing\nregime is up to several hundred times brighter in the optical bands.

During this\nphase, the inflaton typically oscillates at the bottom of its potential and\ngradually transfers its energy to radiation. At the same time, the amplitude of\nthe fields coupled to the inflaton may undergo parametric resonance and, as a\nconsequence, explosive particle production can take place. A priori, these\nphenomena could lead to an amplification of the super-Hubble scale curvature\nperturbations which, in turn, would modify the standard inflationary\npredictions. However, remarkably, it has been shown that, although the\nMukhanov-Sasaki variable does undergo narrow parametric instability during\npreheating, the amplitude of the corresponding super-Hubble curvature\nperturbations remain constant. Therefore, in single field models, metric\npreheating does not affect the power spectrum of the large scale perturbations.\nIn this article, we investigate the corresponding effect on the scalar\nbi-spectrum. Using the Maldacena's formalism, we analytically show that, for\nmodes of cosmological interest, the contributions to the scalar bi-spectrum as\nthe curvature perturbations evolve on super-Hubble scales during preheating is\ncompletely negligible. Specifically, we illustrate that, certain terms in the\nthird order action governing the curvature perturbations which may naively be\nexpected to contribute significantly are exactly canceled by other\ncontributions to the bi-spectrum.

Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies.

These models are energized by nuclear energy deposition when the shock\nfront passes through the silicon-rich layer and/or later it touches the\noxygen-rich layer. Depending on the neutrino luminosity and its decay time, a\ndiagnostic energy of explosion increases up to a few times 10^50 erg for models\nwith nuclear burning compared to the corresponding models without. We point out\nthat these features are most remarkable for the Limongi-Chieffi progenitor in\nboth 1D and 2D, because the progenitor model possesses a massive oxygen layer\nwith its inner-edge radius being smallest among the employed progenitors, so\nthat the shock can touch the rich fuel on a shorter timescale after bounce.

The window of VHE gamma rays was opened only in 1989 by the\nWhipple collaboration, reporting the observation of TeV gamma rays from the\nCrab nebula. After a slow start, this new field of research is now rapidly\nexpanding with the discovery of more than 150 VHE gamma-ray emitting sources.\nProgress is intimately related with the steady improvement of detectors and\nrapidly increasing computing power. We give an overview of the early attempts\nbefore and around 1989 and the progress after the pioneering work of the\nWhipple collaboration. The main focus of this article is on the development of\nexperimental techniques for Earth-bound gamma-ray detectors; consequently, more\nemphasis is given to those experiments that made an initial breakthrough rather\nthan to the successors which often had and have a similar (sometimes even\nhigher) scientific output as the pioneering experiments. The considered energy\nthreshold is about 30 GeV. At lower energies, observations can presently only\nbe performed with balloon or satellite-borne detectors.

Muon\nenergy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss\n(dE/dx) along the muon's path and relating the dE/dx to the muon energy.\nBecause high-energy muons (E_mu > 1 TeV) lose energy randomly, the spread in\ndE/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 in\nlog10(E_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the IceCube\ndetector. In this paper, we present an improved method that uses a truncated\nmean and other techniques to determine the muon energy.

The elimination of\nsegments with the highest dE/dx results in an overall dE/dx that is more\nclosely correlated to the muon energy.

We\nmodel this flare using asymmetric flare templates and constrain the physical\nsize and energetics of the emitting region. Furthermore, the spectral index of\nthe object softens considerably during the course of the flare from\nalpha(nu)=-1.0 to alpha(nu)=-1.4.

Following recent theoretical models of wind mass loss and core\ncollapse supernovae, we assume that the mass of the stellar remnants depends on\nthe metallicity of the progenitor stars. In particular, massive metal-poor\nstars (Z<=0.3 Zsun) are enabled to form massive stellar black holes (MSBHs,\nwith mass >=25 Msun) through direct collapse. We find that three-body\nencounters, and especially dynamical exchanges, dominate the evolution of the\nMSBHs formed in our simulations. In SCs with Z=0.01 and 0.1 Zsun, about 75 per\ncent of simulated MSBHs form from single stars and become members of binaries\nthrough dynamical exchanges in the first 100 Myr of the SC life. This is a\nfactor of >~3 more efficient than in the case of low-mass (<25 Msun) stellar\nblack holes. A small but non-negligible fraction of MSBHs power wind-accreting\n(10-20 per cent) and Roche lobe overflow (RLO, 5-10 per cent) binary systems.\nThe vast majority of MSBH binaries that undergo wind accretion and/or RLO were\nborn from dynamical exchange.

In this paper, we study the hot\nX-ray coronae beyond the optical disks of two normal massive spirals, NGC1961\nand NGC6753. Based on XMM-Newton X-ray observations, hot gaseous emission is\ndetected to ~60 kpc - well beyond their optical radii. The hot gas has a\nbest-fit temperature of kT~0.6 keV and an abundance of ~0.1 Solar, and exhibits\na fairly uniform distribution, suggesting that the quasi-static gas resides in\nhydrostatic equilibrium in the potential well of the galaxies. The bolometric\nluminosity of the gas in the (0.05-0.15)r_200 region (r_200 is the virial\nradius) is ~6e40 erg/s for both galaxies. The baryon mass fractions of NGC1961\nand NGC6753 are f_b~0.1, which fall short of the cosmic baryon fraction. The\nhot coronae around NGC1961 and NGC6753 offer an excellent basis to probe\nstructure formation simulations.

Consequences for\n  secondary star formation in the context of self-enrichment via fast rotating\n  massive stars Abstract: The self-enrichment scenario for globular clusters (GC) requires large\namounts of residual gas after the initial formation of the first stellar\ngeneration. Recently, Krause et al. (2012) found that supernovae may not be\nable to expel that gas, as required to explain their present day gas-free\nstate, and suggested that a sudden accretion on to the dark remnants, at a\nstage when type II supernovae have ceased, may plausibly lead to fast gas\nexpulsion. Here, we explore the consequences of these results for the\nself-enrichment scenario via fast rotating massive stars (FRMS). We analyse the\ninteraction of FRMS with the intra-cluster medium (ICM), in particular where,\nwhen and how the second generation of stars may form. From the results, we\ndevelop a timeline of the first approximately 40 Myr of GC evolution. The\nresults of Paper I imply three phases during which the ICM is in a\nfundamentally different state, namely the wind bubble phase (lasting 3.5 to 8.8\nMyr), the supernova phase (lasting 26.2 to 31.5 Myr), and the dark remnant\naccretion phase (lasting 0.1 to 4 Myr): (i) Quickly after the first generation\nmassive stars have formed, stellar wind bubbles compress the ICM into thin\nfilaments. No stars may form in the normal way during this phase, due to the\nhigh Lyman-Werner flux density. If the first generation massive stars have\nhowever equatorial ejections, as we proposed in the FRMS scenario, accretion\nmay resume in the shadow of the equatorial ejecta. The second generation stars\nmay then form due to gravitational instability in these discs that are fed by\nboth the FRMS ejecta and pristine gas. [...] \n\n"}

Here, we simulate the merger of two CO WDs using a moving-mesh code that\nallows for the inclusion of thin helium (He) shells (0.01\\,\\msun) on top of the\nWDs, at an unprecedented numerical resolution. The accretion of He onto the\nprimary WD leads to the formation of a detonation in its He shell.

Abstract: Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), if exist in nature, are expected to mix with\nphotons in the presence of an external magnetic field. The energy range of\nphotons which undergo strong mixing with ALPs depends on the ALP mass, on its\ncoupling with photons as well as on the external magnetic field and particle\ndensity configurations. Recent observations of blazars by the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope in the 0.1-300 GeV energy range show a break in their spectra\nin the 1-10 GeV range. We have modeled this spectral feature for the\nflat-spectrum radio quasar 3C454.3 during its November 2010 outburst, assuming\nthat a significant fraction of the gamma rays convert to ALPs in the large\nscale jet of this blazar. Using theoretically motivated models for the magnetic\nfield and particle density configurations in the kiloparsec scale jet, outside\nthe broad-line region, we find an ALP mass $m_a\\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-7}$ eV and\ncoupling $g_{a\\gamma} \\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ after performing an\nillustrative statistical analysis of spectral data in four different epochs of\nemission.

Application in the\n  redshift range 0-1.1 Abstract: Long Gamma Ray Bursts (LGRBs) are related to the final stages of evolution of\nmassive stars. As such, they should follow the star formation rate (SFR) of\ngalaxies. We can use them to probe for star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the\ndistant universe following this assumption. The relation between the rate of\nLGRBs in a given galaxy and its SFR (that we call the LGRB \"bias\") may be\ncomplex, as we have indications that the LGRB hosts are not perfect analogues\nto the general population of SFGs. In this work, we try to quantify the\ndependence of the LGRB bias on physical parameters of their host galaxy such as\nthe SFR or the stellar mass. We propose an empirical method based on the\ncomparison of stellar mass functions (and SFR distributions) of LGRB hosts and\nof SFGs in order to find how the bias depends on the stellar mass or the SFR.\nBy applying this method to a sample of LGRB hosts at redshifts lower than 1.1,\nwhere the properties of SFGs are well established, and where the properties of\nLGRB host galaxies can be deduced from observations (for stellar masses larger\nthan 10**9.25 Msun and SFR larger than 1.8 Msun / yr), we find that the LGRB\nbias depends on both the stellar mass and SFR. We find that the bias decreases\nwith the SFR, i.e. we see no preference for highly SFGs, once taken into\naccount the larger number of massive stars in galaxies with larger SFR. We do\nnot find any trend with the specific star formation rate (SSFR) but the\ndynamical range in SSFR in our study is narrow. Although through an indirect\nmethod, we relate these trends to a possible decrease of the LGRBs rate / SFR\nratio with the metallicity. The method we propose suggests trends that may be\nuseful to constrain models of LGRB progenitors, showing a clear decrease of the\nLGRB bias with the metallicity. This is promising for the future as the number\nof LGRB hosts studied will increase. \n\n"}

The analysis by Dainotti of GRB Swift afterglow\nlightcurves with known redshifts and definite X-ray plateau shows an\nanti-correlation between the rest frame time when the plateau ends (the plateau\nend time) and the calculated luminosity at that time (or approximately an\nanti-correlation between plateau duration and luminosity).

Since some of this correlation could result from the redshift\ndependences of these intrinsic parameters, namely their cosmological evolution\nwe use the Efron-Petrosian method to reveal the intrinsic nature of this\ncorrelation.

Before using them as efficient tools in the early Universe,\nhowever, the environmental factors that govern the formation of GRBs need to be\nunderstood. Metallicity is theoretically thought to be a fundamental driver in\nGRB explosions and energetics, but is still, even after more than a decade of\nextensive studies, not fully understood. This is largely related to two\nphenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likely\nhigh-metallicity GRB hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack of\nefficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies including\nmetallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the GRB host population.\nThe subject of this work is the very energetic GRB 110918A, for which we\nmeasure one of the largest host-integrated metallicities, ever, and the highest\nstellar mass for z<1.9.

For all remnants\nplanned to be observed by NuSTAR (and several others), we conclude that\nr-process nuclei are detectable only if the remnant possesses a large\noverabundance O > 1e3 relative to the average yield per SN. Prospects are\nbetter for the next Galactic SN (assumed age of 3 years and distance of 10\nkpc), for which an average r-process yield is detectable via the 10.7(9.2) keV\nline complexes of Os194 by LOFT at 6 sigma (5 sigma) confidence; the 27.3 keV\nline complex of Sb125 is detectable by NuSTAR at 2 sigma for O > 2. We also\nconsider X-rays lines from the remnants of Galactic magnetars, motivated by the\nmuch higher r-process yields of the magneto-rotationally driven SNe predicted\nto birth magnetars. The ~ 3.6-3.9 keV lines of Sn126 are potentially detectable\nin the remnants of the magnetars 1E1547.0-5408 and 1E2259+586 by LOFT for an\nassumed r-process yield predicted by recent simulations. The (non-)detection of\nthese lines can thus probe whether magnetars are indeed born with millisecond\nperiods. Finally, we consider a blind survey of the Galactic plane with LOFT\nfor r-process lines from the most recent binary neutron star merger remnant,\nconcluding that a detection is unlikely without additional information on the\nmerger location. \n\n"}

Using the precisely located 870um\nALMA positions of 99 SMGs, together with 24um and radio imaging of this field,\nwe deblend the Herschel/SPIRE imaging of this region to extract their\nfar-infrared fluxes and colours. The median photometric redshifts for ALMA LESS\n(ALESS) SMGs which are detected in at least two SPIRE bands increases with\nwavelength of the peak in their SEDs, with z=2.3+/-0.2, 2.5+/-0.3 and 3.5+/-0.5\nfor the 250, 350 and 500-um peakers respectively.

In this paper, we\ndetermine the number of distinct observables that can be derived from pulse\nprofile modeling and show that using only bolometric pulse profiles is\ninsufficient for breaking the degeneracy between inferred neutron-star radius\nand mass.

The light curves show that the\nvariability amplitudes in $\\gamma$-ray and optical bands are larger than those\nin the hard X-ray and radio bands and that the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) peaks move to shorter wavelengths when the source becomes brighter, which\nare similar to other blazars, i.e., more variable at wavelengths shorter than\nthe SED peak frequencies. Analysis shows that the characteristic variability\ntimescales in the 14.5 GHz, the optical, the X-ray, and the $\\gamma$-ray bands\nare comparable to each other. The variations of the hard X-ray and 14.5 GHz\nemissions are correlated with zero-lag, so are the V band and $\\gamma$-ray\nvariations, which are consistent with the leptonic models.

The models were computed with\nthe Vertex-CoCoNuT code, using three-flavor, energy-dependent neutrino\ntransport in the ray-by-ray-plus approximation. Our results confirm the close\nsimilarity of the mean energies of electron antineutrinos and heavy-lepton\nneutrinos and even their crossing during the accretion phase for stars with\nM>10 M_sun as observed in previous 1D and 2D simulations with state-of-the-art\nneutrino transport.

For a selected\nhigh-quality sample of 161 measured extensive air showers, we have\nreconstructed the wavefront by measuring pulse arrival times to sub-nanosecond\nprecision in 200 to 350 individual antennas. For each measured air shower, we\nhave fitted a conical, spherical, and hyperboloid shape to the arrival times.\nThe fit quality and a likelihood analysis show that a hyperboloid is the best\nparametrization. Using a non-planar wavefront shape gives an improved angular\nresolution, when reconstructing the shower arrival direction. Furthermore, a\ndependence of the wavefront shape on the shower geometry can be seen. This\nsuggests that it will be possible to use a wavefront shape analysis to get an\nadditional handle on the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, which is\nsensitive to the mass of the primary particle. \n\n"}

Recently Fermi has\nsignificantly extended the spectral coverage of GRB observations and improved\nthe characterization of this spectral evolution. We study how internal shocks\ncan reproduce these observations. In this model the emission comes from the\nsynchrotron radiation of shock accelerated electrons, and the spectral\nevolution is governed by the evolution of the physical conditions in the\nshocked regions. We present a comprehensive set of simulations of a single\npulse and investigate the impact of the model parameters, related to the shock\nmicrophysics and to the initial conditions in the ejecta.\n  We find a general qualitative agreement between the model and the various\nobservations used for the comparison. All these properties or relations are\ngoverned by the evolution of the peak energy and photon indices of the\nspectrum. In addition, we identify the conditions for a quantitative agreement.\nWe find that the best agreement is obtained for (i) steep electron slopes\n(p>~2.7), (ii) microphysics parameters varying with shock conditions so that\nmore electrons are accelerated in stronger shocks, (iii) steep variations of\nthe initial Lorentz factor in the ejecta. When simulating short GRBs by\ncontracting all timescales, all other parameters being unchanged, we show that\nthe hardness-duration correlation is reproduced, as well as the evolution with\nduration of the pulse properties. Finally, we investigate the signature at high\nenergy of these different scenarios and find distinct properties - delayed\nonset, longer emission, and flat spectrum in some cases - suggesting that\ninternal shocks could have a significant contribution to the prompt LAT\nemission.

Here we\nstudied NGC6705, that is a young and massive open cluster located towards the\ninner region of the Milky Way. This cluster is located inside the solar circle.\nThis makes it an important tracer of the inner disk abundance gradient. This\nstudy makes use of BVI and ri photometry and comparisons with theoretical\nisochrones to derive the age of NGC6705. We study the density profile of the\ncluster and the mass function to infer the cluster mass. Based on abundances of\nthe chemical elements distributed in the first internal data release of the\nGaia-ESO Survey, we study elemental ratios and the chemical homogeneity of the\nred clump stars. Radial velocities enable us to study the rotation and internal\nkinematics of the cluster.\n  The estimated ages range from 250 to 316Myr, depending on the adopted stellar\nmodel. Luminosity profiles and mass functions show strong signs of mass\nsegregation. We derive the mass of the cluster from its luminosity function and\nfrom the kinematics, finding values between 3700 M$_{\\odot}$ and 11 000\nM$_{\\odot}$.

The instrumental dead time per\nevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percent\nevent-to-event. The most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noise\nlevel in the power density spectrum (PDS) that cannot be modeled easily with\nthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data. Because the effect\ndescribed above produces a variability pattern in difference light curves\nbetween pairs of lensed images which is correlated with the time-lagged\ncontinuum variability, it can potentially produce systematic errors in\nmeasurement of time delays between pairs of lensed images.

We find that, depending on\nthe ST parameters, the number of GW cycles can be substantially smaller than in\nGR.

However, recently, it has been claimed that nonlinear Landau damping\nrenders it physically irrelevant by reducing the effective damping rate to a\nlow level. Here, we show with numerical calculations that the effective damping\nrate is $8\\times 10^{-4}$ of the growth rate of the linear instability, which\nis sufficient for the \"oblique\" instability to be the dominant cooling\nmechanism of these pair beams. In particular, we show that previous estimates\nof this rate ignored the exponential cutoff in the scattering amplitude at\nlarge wavenumber and assumed that the damping of scattered waves entirely\ndepends on collisions, ignoring collisionless processes. We find that the total\nwave energy eventually grows to approximate equipartition with the beam by\nincreasingly depositing energy into long wavelength modes. As we have not\nincluded the effect of nonlinear wave-wave interactions on these long\nwavelength modes, this scenario represents the \"worst-case\" scenario for the\noblique instability.

In contrast, the detailed time evolutions of the two\nflares present interesting differences. Indeed, the light curves of the two\nflares show both a different structure and peak energy flux ($9.6 \\pm1.8 \\times\n10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $7.1 \\pm1.3 \\times 10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$, respectively in 2010 and 2014). While the tail of the 2010 flare the\nflux decayed exponentially, in 2014 it persisted at a high level.

This uncertainty about the underlying physics has resulted\nin various different star formation laws, all having substantial intrinsic\nscatter. Extending upon previous works that define the column density of star\nformation (Sigma_SFR) by the gas column density (Sigma_gas), we develop a new\nuniversal star formation (SF) law based on the multi-freefall prescription of\ngas. This new SF law relies predominantly on the probability density function\n(PDF) and on the sonic Mach number of the turbulence in the star-forming\nclouds. By doing so we derive a relation where the star formation rate (SFR)\ncorrelates with the molecular gas mass per multi-freefall time, whereas\nprevious models had used the average, single-freefall time. We define a new\nquantity called maximum (multi-freefall) gas consumption rate (MGCR) and show\nthat the actual SFR is only about 0.4% of this maximum possible SFR, confirming\nthe observed low efficiency of star formation.

In the\nframework of star-quake model, based on~\\cite{Baym1971}, the glitch-sizes (the\nrelative increases of spin-frequencies during glitches) $\\Delta \\Omega/\\Omega$\ndepend on the released energies during glitches, with less released energies\ncorresponding to smaller glitch sizes. On the other hand, as one of dark matter\ncandidates, our Galaxy might be filled with the so called strange nuggets (SNs)\nwhich are the relics from the early Universe. In this case the collisions\nbetween pulsars and SNs is inevitable, and these collisions would lead to\nglitches when enough elastic energy has been accumulated during the spin-down\nprocess. The SNs-triggered glitches could release less energy, because the\naccumulated elastic energy would be less than that in the scenario of glitches\nwithout SNs. Therefore, if a pulsar is hit frequently by SNs, it would tend to\nhave more small size glitches, whose values of $\\Delta \\Omega/\\Omega$ are\nsmaller than that in standard star-quake model (with larger amounts of released\nenergy).

The bolometric peak luminosity of most TDE candidates, a\nfew x 10^{44} erg/s, implies that we observe only ~1% of the energy expected\nfrom radiatively efficient accretion.

In this work we present the results of\nthe search for the companion stars of four binary milli-second pulsars, carried\nout with archival data from the Gemini South telescope.

In Super-Kamiokande, these beta decays\nare the dominant background in 6--18 MeV, relevant for solar neutrinos and the\ndiffuse supernova neutrino background.

The relic abundance of these\nparticles is set by gauge interactions and gives rise to dark matter candidates\nwith masses above the electroweak scale. Dark matter annihilations are thus\nmodified by the Sommerfeld effect, not only in the early Universe, but also\ntoday, for instance, in the Center of the Galaxy. Majorana candidates -\ntriplet, quintuplet, bi-doublet, and bi-triplet - bring only one new parameter\nto the model, their mass, and are hence highly testable at colliders and\nthrough astrophysical observations.

We use the scattering properties to\nestimate an intrinsic brightness temperature of 7*10^12 K, which is consistent\nwith expected theoretical limits, but which is ~15 times lower than estimates\nthat neglect substructure. At 6.2 cm, the substructure influences the measured\nvalues appreciably but gives an estimated brightness temperature that is\ncomparable to models that do not account for the substructure. At 1.35 cm, the\nsubstructure does not affect the extremely high inferred brightness\ntemperatures, in excess of 10^13 K. We also demonstrate that for a source\nhaving a Gaussian surface brightness profile, a single long-baseline estimate\nof refractive substructure determines an absolute minimum brightness\ntemperature, if the scattering properties along a given line of sight are\nknown, and that this minimum accurately approximates the apparent brightness\ntemperature over a wide range of total flux densities. \n\n"}

Here we explore the non-trivial coupling between these two\nprocesses and analyze how the global properties of externally supplied\ncircumbinary disks depend on the binary accretion rate. By formulating our\nresults in terms of the angular momentum flux driven by internal stresses, we\ncome up with a very simple classification of the possible global disk\nstructures, which differ from the standard constant $\\dot M$ accretion disk\nsolution. Suppression of accretion by the binary tides, leading to a\nsignificant mass accumulation in the inner disk, accelerates binary inspiral.\nWe show that once the disk region strongly perturbed by the viscously\ntransmitted tidal torque exceeds the binary semi-major axis, the binary can\nmerge in less than its mass-doubling time due to accretion. Thus, unlike the\ninspirals driven by stellar scattering, the gas-assisted merger can occur even\nif the binary is embedded in a relatively low mass disk (lower than its own\nmass). This is important for resolving the \"last parsec\" problem for SMBH\nbinaries and understanding powerful gravitational wave sources in the Universe.\nWe argue that the enhancement of accretion by the binary found in some recent\nsimulations cannot persist for a long time and should not affect the long-term\norbital inspiral.

While progresses have been made in understanding\ntheir formation and growth, their observational signatures remain largely\nunexplored. As a result, no detection of such sources has been confirmed so\nfar. Supported by numerical simulations, we present a novel photometric method\nto identify black hole seed candidates in deep multi-wavelength surveys.

We\ndemonstrate the accuracy of our formalism for CR acceleration at shocks through\nsimulations of plane-parallel shock tubes that are compared to newly derived\nexact solutions of the Riemann shock tube problem with CR acceleration.

If a component of\nthe kick along the line of sight is present, gravitational waves emitted during\nthe final orbits and merger will be gradually Doppler shifted as the kick\nbuilds up. We develop a simple prescription to capture this effect in existing\nwaveform models, showing that future gravitational wave experiments will be\nable to perform direct measurements, not only of the black hole kick velocity,\nbut also of its accumulation profile.

Relativistic reconnection produces hard power-law\nelectron energy distributions N(gamma) = N_0 gamma^(-p) exp(-gamma/gamma_max)\nwith index p -> 1 and exponential cut-off Lorentz factor gamma_max ~ sigma in\nthe limit of magnetization sigma = B^2/(4 pi w) >> 1 (where w is the\nrelativistic enthalpy density). Reconnection in electron-proton plasma can\nadditionally boost gamma_max by the mass ratio m_p/m_e.

At the same time, relativistic AGN jets should be\nhighly inhomogeneous due to filamentary loading of protons, which should\ndetermine the value of sigma_mean roughly independently of the blazar class. \n\n"}

For the first time, we compute here the pair-production opacities\nin the GeV range produced by a realistic BLR accounting for the radial\nstratification and radiation anisotropy. Using photoionization modelling with\nthe CLOUDY code, we calculate a series of BLR models of different sizes,\ngeometries, cloud densities, column densities and metallicities. The strongest\nemission features in the model BLR are Ly$\\alpha$ and HeII Ly$\\alpha$.\nContribution of recombination continua is smaller, especially for hydrogen,\nbecause Ly continuum is efficiently trapped inside the large optical depth BLR\nclouds and converted to Lyman emission lines and higher-order recombination\ncontinua. The largest effects on the gamma-ray opacity are produced by the BLR\ngeometry and localization of the gamma-ray source. We show that when the\ngamma-ray source moves further from the central source, all the absorption\ndetails move to higher energies and the overall level of absorption drops\nbecause of decreasing incidence angles between the gamma-rays and BLR photons.\nThe observed positions of the spectral breaks can be used to measure the\ngeometry and the location of the gamma-ray emitting region relative to the BLR.\nStrong dependence on geometry means that the soft photons dominating the\npair-production opacity may be actually produced by a different population of\nBLR clouds than the bulk of the observed broad line emission. \n\n"}

Determining gas\nand dust mass-loss rates (MLRs) is important in quantifying the contribution of\nevolved stars to the enrichment of the interstellar medium. Aims: Attempt to,\nfor the first time, spectrally resolve CO thermal line emission in a small\nsample of AGB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Methods: ALMA was used to\nobserve 2 OH/IR stars and 4 carbon stars in the LMC in the CO J= 2-1 line.\nResults: We present the first measurement of expansion velocities in\nextragalactic carbon stars. All four C-stars are detected and wind expansion\nvelocities and stellar velocities are directly measured. Mass-loss rates are\nderived from modelling the spectral energy distribution and Spitzer/IRS\nspectrum with the DUSTY code. Gas-to-dust ratios are derived that make the\npredicted velocities agree with the observed ones. The expansion velocities and\nMLRs are compared to a Galactic sample of well-studied relatively low MLRs\nstars supplemented with \"extreme\" C-stars that have properties more similar to\nthe LMC targets. Gas MLRs derived from a simple formula are significantly\nsmaller than derived from the dust modelling, indicating an order of magnitude\nunderestimate of the estimated CO abundance, time-variable mass loss, or that\nthe CO intensities in LMC stars are lower than predicted by the formula derived\nfor Galactic objects. This could be related to a stronger interstellar\nradiation field in the LMC. Conclusions: Although the LMC sample is small and\nthe comparison to Galactic stars is non-trivial because of uncertainties in\ntheir distances it appears that for C stars the wind expansion velocities in\nthe LMC are lower than in the solar neighbourhood, while the MLRs appear\nsimilar.

Knowing the\ndistributions of their orbital parameters (OPs) is important for a wide range\nof topics, from stellar feedback to binary evolution channels, from the\ndistribution of supernova types to gravitational wave progenitors, yet, no\ndirect measurements exist outside the Milky Way. The Tarantula Massive Binary\nMonitoring was designed to help fill this gap by obtaining multi-epoch radial\nvelocity monitoring of 102 MBs in the 30 Dor. In this paper, we analyse 32\nVLT/FLAMES observations of 93 O- and 7 B-type binaries. We performed a Fourier\nanalysis and obtained orbital solutions for 82 systems: 51 single- and 31\ndouble-lined spectroscopic binaries. Overall, the OPs and binary fraction are\nremarkably similar across the 30 Dor region and compared to existing Galactic\nsamples (GSs). This indicates that within these domains environmental effects\nare of second order in shaping the properties of MBs. A small difference is\nfound in the distribution of orbital periods (OrbPs), which is slightly flatter\n(in log space) in 30 Dor than in the Galaxy, although this may be compatible\nwithin error estimates and differences in the fitting methodology. Also, OrbPs\nin 30 Dor can be as short as 1.1 d; somewhat shorter than seen in GSs. Equal\nmass binaries q>0.95 in 30 Dor are all found outside NGC 2070 the very young\nand massive cluster at 30 Dor's core. One outstanding exception however is the\nfact that earliest spectral types (O2-O7) tend to have shorter OrbPs than\nlatter (O9.2-O9.7). Our results point to a relative universality of the\nincidence rate of MBs and their OPs in the metallicity range from solar\n($Z_{\\odot}$) to about $0.5Z_{\\odot}$.

As shown in previous works, r-mode\ndissipation by shear viscosity is not sufficient to explain observational set\n(a), and enhanced r-mode dissipation at the red-shifted internal temperatures\n$T^\\infty\\sim 10^8$ K is required to stabilize the observed NSs.

The strongest\nand most robust result we find is that the luminosities of all spectral\nfeatures (except those of helium) tend to be higher in objects with steeper\nlate-time V-band decline rates. A steep late-time V-band slope likely arises\nfrom less efficient trapping of gamma-rays and positrons, which could be caused\nby multidimensional effects such as clumping of the ejecta or asphericity of\nthe explosion itself.

With their\njets not directly pointing towards us (i.e. misaligned), they offer a unique\ntool to probe into the nature of the fundamental (and often hidden) physical\nprocesses in AGN. This review highlights and discusses some of the\nobservational and theoretical progress achieved in the gamma-ray regime during\nrecent years, including the evidence for unexpected spectral hardening in\nCentaurus A and extreme short-term variability as seen in IC 310 and M87. \n\n"}

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are\nused to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of\nthe morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification\nmethods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency\nand accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and\ncharacterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and\nsubsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby\nimproving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We\ndemonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first\nobserving run. \n\n"}

In GeV - TeV $\\gamma$-rays, IC310 was\ndetected in low and high flux states by the MAGIC telescopes from October 2009\nto February 2010. Taking into account that the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) up to a few GeV seems to exhibit a double-peak feature and that a\nsingle-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model can explain all of the\nmultiwavelength emission except for the non-simultaneous MAGIC emission, we\ninterpret, in this work, the multifrequency data set of the radio galaxy IC310\nin the context of homogeneous hadronic and leptonic models. In the leptonic\nframework, we present a multi-zone SSC model with two electron populations to\nexplain the whole SED whereas for the hadronic model, we propose that a\nsingle-zone SSC model describes the SED up to a few GeVs and neutral pion decay\nproducts resulting from p$\\gamma$ interactions could describe the TeV - GeV\n$\\gamma$-ray spectra.

And more importantly, helium is unlikely to\nbe completely stripped off the progenitor stars and could be present in the\nejecta. It is a mystery why helium features are not detected, even though\nnon-thermal energy sources, capable of ionizing He atoms, may exist as\nsuggested by the O II absorption series in the early time spectra. At late\ntimes (+240d), our spectra appear to have intrinsically lower [O I]6300A\nluminosities than that of SN2015bn and SN2007bi, possibly an indication of\nsmaller oxygen masses (<10-30Msun). The blue-shifted H-alpha emission relative\nto the hosts for all three events may be in tension with the binary star model\nproposed for iPTF13ehe. Finally, iPTF15esb has a peculiar light curve with\nthree peaks separated from one another by ~ 22 days. The LC undulation is\nhigher in bluer bands.

Using data for 24 RRATs, we find that their period\nderivatives are generally larger than those of normal pulsars, independent of\nany intrinsic correlation with period, indicating that RRATs' highly sporadic\nemission may be associated with intrinsically larger magnetic fields. We carry\nout Lomb$-$Scargle tests to search for periodicities in RRATs' pulse detection\ntimes with long timescales.

About two dozen of these stellar tidal\ndisruption flares (TDFs) may have been detected in optical transient surveys.\nHowever, explaining the observed properties of these events within the tidal\ndisruption paradigm is not yet possible. This theoretical ambiguity has led\nsome authors to suggest that optical TDFs are due to a different process, such\nas a nuclear supernova or accretion disk instabilities. Here we present a test\nof a fundamental prediction of the tidal disruption event scenario: a\nsuppression of the flare rate due to the direct capture of stars by the black\nhole. Using a recently compiled sample of candidate TDFs with black hole mass\nmeasurements, plus a careful treatment of selection effects in this\nflux-limited sample, we confirm that the dearth of observed TDFs from high-mass\nblack holes is statistically significant. All the TDF impostor models we\nconsider fail to explain the observed mass function; the only scenario that\nfits the data is a suppression of the rate due to direct captures. We find that\nthis suppression can explain the low volumetric rate of the luminous TDF\ncandidate ASASSN-15lh, thus supporting the hypothesis that this flare belongs\nto the TDF family. Our work is the first to present the optical TDF luminosity\nfunction. A steep power law is required to explain the observed rest-frame\ng-band luminosity, $dN/dL_{g} \\propto L_{g}^{-2.5}$.

This approach is based on the\nmultipolar expansion of gravitational wave emission and appeals to the global\nphysical properties of the star (energy, angular momentum, and thermal state),\nbut not to canonical energy and angular momentum, which is traditional. It\nleads to simple derivation of the CFS instability criterion for normal modes\nand the evolution equations for a star, affected by this instability. The\napproach also gives a precise form to simple explanation of the CFS\ninstability: it occurs when two conditions met: (a) gravitational wave emission\nremoves angular momentum from the rotating star (thus releasing the rotation\nenergy) and (b) gravitational waves carry less energy, than the released amount\nof the rotation energy. Results are illustrated by r-mode instability in slowly\nrotating Newtonian stars. In resulting evolution equations emission of\ngravitational waves directly affects the spin frequency, being in line with the\narguments by Levin & Ushomirsky (2001), but in contrast to widely accepted\nequations by Lindblom et al.

Our detection rate and the\nmaximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,\nall made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating\ncircular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose\nthat the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength\nsample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.\nCircular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or\nshorter than our median sampling interval <1 month.

The cores of SBs are made of\npurely incompressible superconducting gluon-quark superfluids (henceforth\nSuSu-fluids). Such quantum fluids have a uniform supranuclear density and\ngoverned by the critical EOSs for baryonic matter $P_b = \\mathcal{E}_b$ and for\n$\\phi-$induced dark energy $P_\\phi= -\\mathcal{E}_\\phi.$ The incompressibility\nhere ensures that particles communicate on the shortest possible timescale,\nsuperfluidity and superconductivity enforce SBs to spin-down promptly as\ndictated by the Onsager-Feynman equation, whereas their lowest energy state\ngrants SBs lifetimes that are comparable to those of protons.

Results: We\nconfirm the, previously noted, presence of the low energy (<6 keV) spectral\nrollover and argue that it could be interpreted as thermal emission. The\nspectra are well described by a double thermal model consisting of a \"hot\" (>1\nkeV) and a \"cool\" (<0.7 keV) multicolor black body (MCB). Under the assumption\nthat the \"cool\" MCD emission originates in a disk truncated at the NS\nmagnetosphere, we find that all ULXs in our sample are consistent with\naccretion onto a highly magnetized (B>10^12G) NS. We note a strong correlation\nbetween the strength of the magnetic field, the temperature of the \"hot\"\nthermal component and the total unabsorbed luminosity. Examination of the\nNuSTAR data supported this interpretation and confirmed the presence of a weak,\nhigh energy (>15 keV) tail, most likely the result of modification of the MCB\nemission by inverse Compton scattering. We also note that the apparent high\nenergy tail, may simply be the result of mis-modeling of MCB emission with an\natypical temperature (T) vs radius (r) gradient, using a standard MCD model\nwith a fixed gradient of T~r^-0.75. Conclusions: We have offered a new physical\ninterpretation for the dual-thermal spectra of ULXs.

The orbital eccentricity has important effect on GW\nspectra, and therefore on the SGWB and GW-SGRB co-detection rate. Our results\nshow that the power spectra of the SGWBs from eccentric compact binaries are\ngreatly suppressed at low frequencies.

For some sources, timing noise is\nattributable to a pulsar switching between two different spin-down rates\n$(\\dot{\\nu})$. Such transitions may be common but difficult to resolve using\ncurrent techniques. In this work, we use simulations of $\\dot{\\nu}$-variable\npulsars to investigate the likelihood of resolving individual $\\dot{\\nu}$\ntransitions. We inject step-changes in the value of $\\dot{\\nu}$ with a wide\nrange of amplitudes and switching timescales. We then attempt to redetect these\ntransitions using standard pulsar timing techniques. The pulse arrival-time\nprecision and the observing cadence are varied. Limits on $\\dot{\\nu}$\ndetectability based on the effects such transitions have on the timing\nresiduals are derived. With the typical cadences and timing precision of\ncurrent timing programs, we find we are insensitive to a large region of\n$\\Delta \\dot{\\nu}$ parameter space which encompasses small, short timescale\nswitches.

However, this\ninterpretation, which is based on extrapolations of the Standard Model (SM) to\nultra-LHC energies, is strained from both astrophysical and particle\nphenomenology perspectives. We consider the alternative that after some energy\nthreshold, the first collision of the primary in the atmosphere results in a\nstate, the decay of which leads to a considerably increased shower particle\nmultiplicity, so that light-primary EAS appear heavy-like. We show that a\nminimal implementation of such a model yields predictions for the average EAS\ndepth and shower-to-shower fluctuations that are consistent with each other,\nand an excellent fit to Auger data.

We also find mass-loss rates\n(dM/dt_wind), exceeding the typical mass-accretion rate (dM/dt_accr) of 0.001\nMsun/yr during massive-star formation. We express our mass-loss predictions as\na function of mass and Z, finding log dM/dt = -9.13 + 2.1 log(M/Msun) + 0.74\nlog(Z/Zsun) (Msun/yr). Even if stellar winds would not directly halt & reverse\nmass accretion during star formation, if the most massive stars form by stellar\nmergers stellar wind mass loss may dominate over the rate at which stellar\ngrowth takes place. We therefore argue that the upper-mass limit is effectively\nZ-dependent due to the nature of radiation-driven winds.

We show that for the motion of\nelementary particles in vacuum metrics the DWB equation can be reduced to the\ncovariant form of the LD equation which we use here. Generically, the LD\nequation is plagued by runaway solutions, so we discuss computational ways to\navoid this problem in constructing numerical solutions. We also use the first\niteration of the covariant LD equation which is the covariant Landau-Lifshitz\nequation, comparing results of these two approaches and showing smallness of\nthe third-order Schott term in the ultrarelativistic case.

As a\nresult of the density-dependent dynamics, we find the superfluid to transfer\nangular momentum to different parts of the crust and the core on different\ntimescales. This can cause the spin frequency change to become non-monotonic in\ntime, allowing for a maximum value much larger than the measured glitch size,\nas well as a delay in the recovery.

Previous strong tidal disruption event (TDE)\ncandidates were all associated with the centers of largely isolated galaxies.\nHere we report the discovery of a luminous X-ray outburst from a massive star\ncluster at a projected distance of 12.5 kpc from the center of a large\nlenticular galaxy. The luminosity peaked at ~10^{43} erg/s and decayed\nsystematically over 10 years, approximately following a trend that supports the\nidentification of the event as a TDE. The X-ray spectra were all very soft,\nwith emission confined to be <3.0 keV, and could be described with a standard\nthermal disk. The disk cooled significantly as the luminosity decreased, a key\nthermal-state signature often observed in accreting stellar-mass black holes.\nThis thermal-state signature, coupled with very high luminosities, ultrasoft\nX-ray spectra and the characteristic power-law evolution of the light curve,\nprovides strong evidence that the source contains an intermediate-mass black\nhole (IMBH) with a mass of a few ten thousand solar mass. This event\ndemonstrates that one of the most effective means to detect IMBHs is through\nX-ray flares from TDEs in star clusters. \n\n"}

We first present the general notion of Super-Eddington accretion, and\nthen summarize the different models and numerical simulations developed to\nstudy such regime. We consider optically thick flows in accretion disks as well\nas in spherically symmetric envelopes, and devote particular attention to the\nwidely adopted model based on the SLIM disk solution. While attractive for its\nsimplicity, the SLIM disk solution is challenged by the latest generation of\nthree-dimensional radiation (magneto)-hydrodynamical simulations, in which\nradiative losses can be an order of magnitude higher, and the mechanisms of\nradiation transport is more complex than straight advection as it takes place\nin a complex turbulent regime.

Understanding the statistics of\njitter becomes crucial for properly characterizing arrival-time uncertainties.\nWe characterize the radio-frequency dependence of jitter using data on 48\npulsars in the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves\n(NANOGrav) timing program. We detect significant jitter in 43 of the pulsars\nand test several functional forms for its frequency dependence; we find\nsignificant frequency dependence for 30 pulsars. We find moderate correlations\nof rms jitter with pulse width (R = 0.62) and number of profile components (R =\n0.40); the single-pulse rms jitter is typically ~1% of pulse phase. The average\nfrequency dependence for all pulsars using a power-law model has index -0.42.\nWe investigate the jitter variations for the interpulse of PSR~B1937+21 and\nfind no significant deviations from the main pulse rms jitter. We also test the\ntime-variation of jitter in two pulsars and find that systematics likely bias\nthe results for high-precision pulsars. Pulsar timing array analyses must\nproperly model jitter as a significant component of the noise within the\ndetector. \n\n"}

Even the evaluation of the jet power is not trivial, since\nthe radiation from the jet is enhanced by relativistic beaming, and there are\nfundamental uncertainties concerning the matter content of the jet\n(electron--proton or electron--positron plasma).

But research over the last decade in particular\nhas demonstrated that various non-ideal MHD effects can impede or extinguish\nthe MRI, especially in protoplanetary disks. In this paper we propose a new\nscenario, by which the magnetic field is generated and sustained via the\ngravitational instability (GI). We use 3D stratified shearing box simulations\nto characterise the dynamo and find that it works at low magnetic Reynolds\nnumber (from unity to ~100) for a wide range of cooling times and boundary\nconditions. The process is kinematic, with a relatively fast growth rate ($<\n0.1 \\Omega$), and it shares some properties of mean field dynamos. The magnetic\nfield is generated via the combination of differential rotation and spiral\ndensity waves, the latter providing compressible horizontal motions and\nlarge-scale vertical rolls. At greater magnetic Reynolds numbers the build up\nof large-scale field is diminished and instead small-scale structures emerge\nfrom the breakdown of twisted flux ropes.

These bursts reveal complex time-frequency structures that include\nsub-bursts with finite bandwidths. The frequency-dependent burst structure\ncomplicates the determination of a dispersion measure (DM); we argue that it is\nappropriate to use a DM metric that maximizes frequency-averaged pulse\nstructure, as opposed to peak signal-to-noise, and find DM = 560.57 +/- 0.07\npc/cc at MJD 57644. After correcting for dispersive delay, we find that the\nsub-bursts have characteristic frequencies that typically drift lower at later\ntimes in the total burst envelope. In the 1.1-1.7 GHz band, the ~ 0.5-1-ms\nsub-bursts have typical bandwidths ranging from 100-400 MHz, and a\ncharacteristic drift rate of ~ 200 MHz/ms towards lower frequencies. At higher\nradio frequencies, the sub-burst bandwidths and drift rate are larger, on\naverage. While these features could be intrinsic to the burst emission\nmechanism, they could also be imparted by propagation effects in the medium\nlocal to the source.

In the following 11 years, the source stayed in a quiescent/low\nactivity phase. XTE J1810-197 is one of the closest magnetars, hence its X-ray\nproperties can be studied in detail even in quiescence and an extended\nmonitoring has been carried out to study its long term timing and spectral\nevolution.

They can be further accelerated\nstochastically by the turbulence. To probe the properties of such relativistic\nparticles, we perform magnetohydrodynamic simulations to obtain the turbulent\nfields generated by the MRI, and calculate orbits of the high-energy particles\nusing snapshot data of the MRI turbulence.

The resulting coherent torques efficiently change the\nmagnitude of the angular momenta and rotate the orbital inclination in all\ndirections. As a result, many of the tightly bound stars very near the MBH are\nrapidly destroyed by falling into the MBH on low-angular momentum orbits, while\nthe orbits of the remaining stars are efficiently randomized. We solve\nnumerically the Fokker-Planck equation in energy for the steady state\ndistribution of a single mass population with a RR sink term. We find that the\nsteady state current of stars, which sustains the accelerated drainage close to\nthe MBH, can be up to ~10 times larger than that due to non-coherent 2-body\nrelaxation alone. RR mostly affects tightly bound stars, and so it increases\nonly moderately the total tidal disruption rate, which is dominated by stars\noriginating from less bound orbits farther away. We show that the event rate of\ngravitational wave (GW) emission from inspiraling stars, originating much\ncloser to the MBH, is dominated by RR dynamics. The GW event rate depends on\nthe uncertain efficiency of RR. The efficiency indicated by the few available\nsimulations implies rates ~10 times higher than those predicted by 2-body\nrelaxation, which would improve the prospects of detecting such events by\nfuture GW detectors, such as LISA. However, a higher, but still plausible RR\nefficiency can lead to the drainage of all tightly bound stars and strong\nsuppression of GW events from inspiraling stars.

He\npointed out a strong, non-resonant, current-driven instability that had been\noverlooked in the kinetic treatments, and suggested that it is responsible for\nsubstantial amplification of the ambient magnetic field. Magnetic field\namplification is also an important issue in the problem of the formation and\nstructure of relativistic shock fronts, particularly in relation to models of\ngamma-ray bursts. We have therefore generalised the linear analysis to apply to\nthis case, assuming a relativistic background plasma and a monoenergetic,\nunidirectional incoming proton beam. We find essentially the same non-resonant\ninstability noticed by Bell, and show that also under GRB conditions, it grows\nmuch faster than the resonant waves. We quantify the extent to which thermal\neffects in the background plasma limit the maximum growth rate. \n\n"}

Abstract: In gravitational lensing, steeper mass profiles generically produce longer\ntime delays but smaller magnifications, without necessarily changing the image\npositions or magnification ratios between different images. This is well known.\nWe find in this paper, however, that even if steepness is fixed, time delays\ncan still have significant model dependence, which we attribute to shape\nmodeling degeneracies.

Both data sets showed some measure of a\ncorrelation with the supergalactic plane, the locus of cosmologically nearby\ngalaxies, radio galaxies and clusters of galaxies. We need a reasonable model\nof the true intergalactic magnetic field.

We estimate that the magnetic field strength in supergalactic sheets\nand filaments may be in the range of 0.1 to 1 muG. If such strengths are\nrealized inside our Local Supercluster, this opens up the possibility to focus\ncharged particles in the direction perpendicular to the supergalatic plane,\nanaloguously but in the opposite direction to solar wind modulation.

As a model for the inhomogeneity of the\ncosmological magnetic field, we adopt a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation,\nwhere the field is passively included, and can approximately represent the real\nfield distribution with an arbitrary normalization for the field strength.\nThen, we derive an upper limit of the magnetic field strength by comparing the\nobserved limit of rotational measure with the rotational measure expected from\nthe magnetic field geometry in the simulated model universe.
