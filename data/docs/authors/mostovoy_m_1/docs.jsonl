For model parameters appropriate to manganites, and even\nwithin a simple dynamical mean-filed theory (DMFT) framework, it describes many\nof the unusual phenomena seen in manganites, including colossal\nmagnetoresistance (CMR), qualitatively and quantitatively. However, in the\nabsence of long ranged Coulomb interaction, a system described by such a model\nwould actually phase separate, into macroscopic regions of $l$ and $b$\nelectrons respectively. As we show in this paper, in the presence of Coulomb\ninteractions, the {\\em macroscopic} phase separation gets suppressed, and\ninstead nanometer scale regions of polarons interspersed with band electron\npuddles appear, constituting a new kind of quantum Coulomb glass. Our work\npoints to an interplay of strong correlations, long range Coulomb interaction\nand dopant ion disorder as the origin of nanoscale inhomogeneities, rather than\ndisorder frustrated phase competition as is generally believed. Based on this,\nwe argue that the observed micrometer(meso)-scale inhomogeneities owe their\nexistence to extrinsic causes, eg. strain due to cracks and defects. We suggest\npossible experiments to validate our speculation. \n\n"}

Local OAM state in a Bloch state produces\nasymmetric charge distribution (electric dipole). Presence of surface electric\nfield aligns the electric dipole and results in chiral OAM states and the\nrelevant Rashba- type splitting. Therefore, the band splitting originates from\nelectric dipole interaction, not from the Zeeman splitting as proposed in the\noriginal Rashba picture. The characteristic spin chiral structure of Rashba\nstates is formed through the spin-orbit coupling and thus is a secondary effect\nto the chiral OAM.

In these lecture notes for an international school, I emphasize that even\nthough the low energy properties of a phase of matter are generally emergent\nand entirely determined by the broken symmetry, there are many differences\nbetween a strongly correlated and a weakly correlated state of matter. For\nexample, spin waves are an emergent property for antiferromagnets, but for weak\ncorrelations the normal phase of a (Slater) antiferromagnet is metallic,\nwhereas it is insulating (Heisenberg) for strong correlations. As a function of\ninteraction strength, above the antiferromagnetic phase, the crossover between\na metal and a local moment paramagnetic insulator is described by the Mott\ntransition, whose mean-field theory down to T=0 is best formulated with\ndynamical mean-field theory. A similar situation occurs for superconductors:\ndespite similar emergent properties, there are many differences between both\nkinds of superconductors. Experimental evidence suggests that hole-doped\ncuprates are strongly correlated whereas the correlations are weaker in the\nelectron-doped case, especially near optimal doping. Evidence for a pseudogap\narising from antiferromagnetic fluctuations is strong in the latter case,\nwhereas in the hole-doped case the pseudogap temperature appears as a\nconsequence of Mott physics.

The recently\ndiscovered pressure-induced superconductor CrAs, as a rare example of a\nnon-collinear helimagnetic superconductor, has therefore generated great\ninterest in understanding microscopic magnetic properties and their interplay\nwith superconductivity [6-8].

These\noriginate in the frustrated nature of the interactions between the spins. For\nclassical spins the magnetization is discontinuous in a magnetic field. Here we\nexamine the importance of the connectivity of the icosahedron for the\nappearance of the magnetization discontinuity, and also investigate the\ntransition from the classical to the quantum limit. The influence of\nconnectivity on the magnetic properties is revealed by considering the cluster\nas being made up of a closed strip of a triangular lattice with two additional\nspins attached. The classical magnetization discontinuity is shown to evolve\ncontinuously from the discontinuity effected by these two spins when they are\nuncoupled to the cluster. In the second part the transition from the classical\nto the quantum limit is examined by focusing on the low energy spectrum taking\nfully into account the spatial and the spin symmetry of the model in the\ncharacterization of the states. A symmetry analysis of the highly degenerate\ndue to the connectivity lowest energy classical manifold identifies as its\ndirect fingerprint the low energy quantum states for spin magnitude as low as\n$s=1$, with the latter following a tower of states behavior which relates to\nthe icosahedron having a structure reminiscent of a depleted triangular\nlattice.

Our high resolution ARPES allows us to track the\nFermi surface deformation from four-fold to two-fold symmetry across the\nstructural transition at ~87 K which is stabilized as a result of the dramatic\nsplitting of bands associated with dxz and dyz character.

The k-resolved four-hole spectrum at n=2 represents an interesting\nspecial case where a completely stable quadruplon turns into a resonance by\nmerging with the doublon-doublon continuum at a critical wave vector. For all\nfillings with n > 1, the doublon lifetime is strongly k-dependent and is even\ninfinite at the Brillouin zone edges as demonstrated by k-resolved two-hole\nspectra. This can be traced back to the \"hidden\" charge-SU(2) symmetry of the\nmodel which is explicitly broken off half-filling and gives rise to a massive\ncollective excitation, even for arbitrary higher-dimensional but bipartite\nlattices. \n\n"}

In the presence of a\nsmall concentration of impurity bonds, the effective low-energy Hamiltonian is\nthat of Ising variables encoding the sense of rotation of the local canting\naround the impurities. Those degrees of freedom interact through a dipolar\ninteraction mediated by spin waves. A ferromagnetic Ising ground state\nindicates the instability of the XY ferromagnet towards a spiral state with a\nwave vector proportional to the concentration of impurity bonds.

Although a conventional perspective\nsuggests that delocalized states act as a thermalizing bath for the localized\nstates in the presence of of interactions, there is evidence that such systems\ncan display non-ergodicity. This is in part due to the fact that the\ndelocalized states do not have any kind of protection due to symmetry or\ntopology and are thus susceptible to localization. A study of non-interacting\nincommensurate models shows that they admit extended, partially extended, and\nfully localized many-body states. These models cannot thermalize dynamically\nand remain localized upon the introduction of interactions. In particular, for\na certain range of energy, the system can host a non-ergodic extended (i.e.\nmetallic) phase in which the energy eigenstates violate the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis (ETH) but the entanglement entropy obeys volume-law\nscaling. The level statistics and entanglement growth also indicate the lack of\nergodicity in these models. The phenomenon of localization and non-ergodicity\nin a system with interactions despite the presence of single-particle\ndelocalized states is closely related to the so-called \"many-body proximity\neffect\" and can also be observed in models with disorder coupled to systems\nwith delocalized degrees of freedom. Many-body localization in systems with\nincommensurate potentials (without single-particle mobility edges) have been\nrealized experimentally, and we show how this can be modified to study the the\neffects of such mobility edges.

In turn, the incorporation of heavy charges into the\nconduction sea leads to an increase in the volume of the Fermi surface. This\nprocess, called Kondo scattering, is accompanied by a dramatic, temperature\ndependent transformation of the electronic interactions and masses. Since the\nKondo phenomena is controlled by quantum fluctuations, here we ask, at which\npoint does the Fermi surface change character? A priori, the answer is not\nclear, since near its onset, the Kondo effect cannot be described as a simple\nhybridization of electronic eigenstates. Conventional descriptions of this\nKondo scattering process consider that hybridization, Fermi volume change, and\n$f$-electron mobility occur simultaneously. However, using angle resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy to measure the evolution of excitations, we find\nthat the changes of the Fermi surface emerge at temperatures an order of\nmagnitude higher than the opening of the hybridization gap, and two orders of\nmagnitude higher than the onset of the coherent character of the $f$-electrons.\nWe suggest that the large changes in Fermi volume, driven by electronic\nfluctuations, occur at temperatures where the various $\\Gamma_x \\to \\Gamma_y$\ncrystal field-split $f$ levels become accessible to conduction states of the\ncorresponding symmetries. The separation of these energy scales significantly\nmodifies the conventional description of the Kondo lattice effect, which still\nlacks a full theoretical description. \n\n"}

This\nmodel develops stripes and robust D-wave pairing correlation upon hole doping,\nand it has the advantage that it can be numerically simulated without sign\nproblems. Both static and dynamical information can be obtained. In this work\nit was possible to analyze up to 12x12 site clusters at low temperatures\nranging between 0.01t and 0.1t (between 50K and 500K for a hopping amplitude $t\n\\sim 0.5 eV$). As the temperature is reduced, spectral weight is transferred\nfrom high to low frequencies in agreement with the behavior observed\nexperimentally. Varying the hole density, the Drude weight has a maximum at the\noptimal doping for the model, i.e., at the density where the pairing\ncorrelations are stronger. It was also observed that the inverse of the Drude\nweight, roughly proportional to the resistivity, decreases linearly with the\ntemperature at optimal doping, and it is abruptly reduced when robust pairing\ncorrelations develop upon further reducing the temperature.

It is\nbased on the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme for the self-energy\nwhich is formulated for crystal orbitals (CO-ADC). In this approach, the poles\nof the Green's function are determined by solving a suitable Hermitian\neigenvalue problem. The method is not only applicable to the outer valence and\nconduction bands, it is also stable for inner valence bands where strong\nelectron correlations are effective. The key to the proposed scheme is to\nevaluate the self-energy in terms of Wannier orbitals before transforming it to\na crystal momentum representation. Exploiting the fact that electron\ncorrelations are mainly local, one can truncate the lattice summations by an\nappropriate configuration selection scheme. This yields a flat configuration\nspace; i.e., its size scales only linearly with the number of atoms per unit\ncell for large systems and, under certain conditions, the computational effort\nto determine band structures also scales linearly.

In the polarized Raman spectra at room temperature we\nobserve resonant enhancement of the 969 $cm^{-1}$ phonon mode when the laser\nenergy approaches 2.7 eV, presumably related to the (p-d) electron hopping\nband, $O_3$($p_y$)-V($d_{xy}$), at 3.2 eV. The 969 $cm^{-1}$ mode originates\nfrom the stretching vibrations along the c-axis involving the V-$O_1$ bonds.\nSince an ellipsometric determination of the dielectric function $\\epsilon_{cc}$\nyields no structure in the 1.7 to 5.5 eV photon energy range, we conclude that\nplane bonds couple strongly with the apical oxygens leading to a large Raman\nefficiency. In the low-temperature Raman spectra, almost all modes that become\nactive below the phase transition temperature T$_c$=34 K show resonant\nbehavior. The most interesting ones, those at 66 and 106 $cm^{-1}$, possibly of\nmagnetic origin, exhibit a resonant intensity enhancement, approximately by an\norder of magnitude, for laser photon energies around 1.85 eV with respect to\n2.43 eV. This resonance effect may be associated with a weak absorption band\naround 2 eV. Finally, a destructive interference between the resonant and the\nnonresonant contribution to the Raman scattering amplitude (i.e. an\nantiresonance) is found in the spectra for most of the (bb) low-temperature\nmodes. \n\n"}
