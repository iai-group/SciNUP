Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

The testimator method is\nextended to multiple stages for the first time, shown to be unbiased and the\nvariance of the estimated slope can be proved to be smaller than the standard\nslope estimated from linear regression theory. The Schwarz Information\nCriterion (also known as the Bayesian Information Criterion) is more\nconservative than the Akaike Information Criterion and tends to choose lower\norder models. By using simulated data sets, we verify that these statistical\ntechniques can be used to detect intrinsically linear and/or non-linear P-L\nrelations.

To obtain realistic simulations, we constructed full-sky SZ maps for\nEDE and LCDM cosmologies, taking angular cluster correlation into account.\nUsing these maps, we simulated Planck observations with and without Galactic\nforegrounds and fed the results into our filter pipeline based on the spherical\nmulti-frequency matched filters.\n  Results. For the case of EDE cosmologies, we clearly find an increase in the\ndetected number of clusters compared to the fiducial LCDM case. This shows that\nthe spherical multi-frequency matched filter is sensitive enough to find\ndeviations from the LCDM sample, being caused by EDE. In addition we find an\ninteresting effect of EDE on the completeness of the cluster sample, such that\nEDE helps to obtain cleaner samples. \n\n"}

I\npresent a conceptually new approach to mitigation of RFI in interferometric\ndata. This has been used to develop a software tool (RfiX) to remove RFI from\nobservations using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, India. However, the\nconcept can be used to excise RFI in any interferometer. Briefly, the\nfringe-stopped correlator output of an interferometer baseline oscillates with\nthe fringe-stop period in the presence of RFI. RfiX works by identifying such a\npattern and subtracting it from the data. It is perhaps the only purely\nsoftware technique which can salvage the true visibility value from\nRFI-corrupted data. It neither requires high-speed hardware nor real-time\nprocessing and works best on normal correlator output integrated for 1-10s. It\ncomplements other mitigation schemes with its different approach and the regime\nit addresses. Its ability to work with data integrated over many seconds gives\nit an advantage while excising weak, persistent RFI unlike most other\ntechniques which use high-speed sampling to localise RFI in time-frequency\nplane. RfiX is also different in that it does not require RFI-free data to\nidentify corrupted sections. Some results from the application of RfiX is\npresented including an image at 240 MHz with a Peak/noise ratio of 43000, the\nhighest till date at wavelengths >1m. \n\n"}

One method employs a direct fit to a modified\nblackbody SED; the other involves a comparison of flux ratios to an analytical\nprediction. Fitting fluxes near the SED peak produces inaccurate temperature\nand dust spectral index estimates due to the line of sight temperature (and\ndensity) variations. Longer wavelength fluxes in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the\nspectrum (>~ 600 micron for typical cores) may more accurately recover the\nspectral index, but both methods are very sensitive to noise. The temperature\nestimate approaches the density weighted temperature, or \"column temperature,\"\nof the source as short wavelength fluxes are excluded. An inverse temperature -\nspectral index correlation naturally results from SED fitting, due to the\ninaccurate isothermal assumption, as well as noise uncertainties. We show that\nabove some \"threshold\" temperature, the temperatures estimated through the flux\nratio method can be highly inaccurate. In general, observations with widely\nseparated wavelengths, and including shorter wavelengths, result in higher\nthreshold temperatures; such observations thus allow for more accurate\ntemperature estimates of sources with temperatures less than the threshold\ntemperature. When only three fluxes are available, a constrained fit, where the\nspectral index is fixed, produces less scatter in the temperature estimate when\ncompared to the estimate from the flux ratio method. \n\n"}

These planets are of particular\ninterest because they tend to orbit more massive hosts, and have been subjected\nto variable stellar insolation over their recent histories as their primaries\nevolved off the main sequence. Unfortunately, we have limited information about\nthe physical properties of these planets, as they were all detected by the\nradial velocity method and none have been observed to transit. Here we evaluate\nthe prospects for detecting transits of planetary companions to giant stars. We\nshow that several of the known systems have a priori transit probabilities of\n>~ 10%, and about one transiting system is expected for the sample of host\nstars with R >= 2.5 R_sun. Although the transits are expected to have very\nsmall amplitudes (~few x 10^-4) and long durations (>~ 50 hrs), we argue that\nthe difficulty with detecting these signals in broadband light is one of\nsystematic errors and practicality rather than photon noise, even for modest\naperture ~1m telescopes. We propose a novel method that may overcome these\ndifficulties, which uses narrow-band measurements to isolate the thin ring of\nchromospheric emission expected at the limb of giant stars. The transit signals\nin these narrow bands are expected to be larger in magnitude and briefer in\nduration than in broad-band emission, and thus alleviating many of the\ndifficulties with transit detection in broad-band emission. Finally, we point\nout that it may be possible to discover planetary companions to giant stars\nusing Kepler, provided that a sufficient number of such targets are monitored. \n\n"}

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the semi-major\naxis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricity\ndistribution is determined after the disk dissipation.

This is the largest sample of individual alpha\nelement (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) abundance measurements in any single dSph. The\nmeasurements are made from Keck/DEIMOS medium-resolution spectra (6400-9000 A,\nR ~ 6500).

The Sculptor [Fe/H]\ndistribution has a mean <[Fe/H]> = -1.58 and is asymmetric with a long,\nmetal-poor tail, indicative of a history of extended star formation. Sculptor\nhas a larger fraction of stars with [Fe/H] < -2 than the Milky Way halo. We\nhave discovered one star with [Fe/H] = -3.80 +/- 0.28, which is the most\nmetal-poor star known anywhere except the Milky Way halo, but high-resolution\nspectroscopy is needed to measure this star's detailed abundances.

We discuss both the\nluminosity-metallicity relation and the luminosity-size relation of these\nsatellites, and find that the chemical evolution histories of each host's\nsatellites is similar. The dynamical mass estimates of M31's dSphs are similar\nor smaller than Milky Way dSphs of the same luminosity despite their sizes\nbeing similar or larger, suggesting M31 dSphs are less dense than Milky Way\ncounterparts.

From 2.5 to 20 solar masses Abstract: We extend our theoretical computations for low-mass stars to\nintermediate-mass and massive stars, for which few databases exist in the\nliterature. Evolutionary tracks and isochrones are computed from 2.50 to 20\nsolar masses for agrid of 37 chemical compositions with metal content Z between\n0.0001 and 0.070 and helium content Y between 0.23 and 0.40. Synthetic TP-AGB\nmodels allow stellar tracks and isochrones to be extended until the end of the\nthermal pulses along the AGB. We provide software tools for the bidimensional\ninterpolation (in Y and Z) of the isochrones. We present tracks for\nscaled-solar abundances and the corresponding isochrones from very old ages\ndown to about 10 million years. The extension of the blue loops and the\ninstability strip of Cepheid stars are compared and the Cepheid\nmass-discrepancy is discussed.

This is the only multi-planet system\ndiscovered by any method with measured masses for the star and both planets. In\naddition to the signatures of two planets, this event also exhibits a\nmicrolensing parallax signature and finite source effects that provide a direct\nmeasure of the masses of the star and planets, and the expected brightness of\nthe host star is confirmed by Keck AO imaging, yielding masses of M_* =\n0.51(+0.05-0.04) M_sun, M_b = 231+-19 M_earth, M_c = 86+-7 M_earth. The\nSaturn-analog planet in this system had a planetary light curve deviation that\nlasted for 11 days, and as a result, the effects of the orbital motion are\nvisible in the microlensing light curve. We find that four of the six orbital\nparameters are tightly constrained and that a fifth parameter, the orbital\nacceleration, is weakly constrained. No orbital information is available for\nthe Jupiter-analog planet, but its presence helps to constrain the orbital\nmotion of the Saturn-analog planet. Assuming co-planar orbits, we find an\norbital eccentricity of eccentricity = 0.15 (+0.17-0.10) and an orbital\ninclination of i = 64 (+4-7) deg.

The companion, which is the star monitored today, is\nlikely to have gained mass from its now-defunct partner, and can be considered\nto be a blue straggler. KOI-81 is almost certainly the product of stable mass\ntransfer; KOI-74 may be as well, or it may be the first clear example of a blue\nstraggler created throughthree-body interactions.\n  We show that mass transfer binaries are common enough that Kepler should\ndiscover ~1000 white dwarfs orbiting main sequence stars. Most, like KOI-74 and\nKOI-81, will be discovered through transits, but many will be discovered\nthrough a combination of gravitational lensing and transits, while lensing will\ndominate for a subset. In fact, some events caused by white dwarfs will have\nthe appearance of \"anti-transits\" --i.e., short-lived enhancements in the\namount of light received from the monitored star. Lensing and other mass\nmeasurements methods provide a way to distinguish white dwarf binaries from\nplanetary systems. This is important for the success of Kepler's primary\nmission, in light of the fact that white dwarf radii are similar to the radii\nof terrestrial planets, and that some white dwarfs will have orbital periods\nthat place them in the habitable zones of their stellar companions.

Out of the confirmed variables, we found 90 RR Lyrae stars,\n49 classical Cepheids (including 36 new discoveries), and 38 eclipsing binary\nstars for which we could determine a period.

For each object basic parameters, multi-epoch\nVI photometry collected within 8 or 13 years of observations, and finding\ncharts are provided in the OGLE Internet archive. We present objects of\nparticular interest: exceptionally numerous sample of single-mode\nsecond-overtone pulsators, five double Cepheids, two Cepheids with eclipsing\nvariations superimposed on the pulsation light curves. At least 139\nfirst-overtone Cepheids exhibit low-amplitude secondary variations with periods\nin the range 0.60-0.65 of the primary ones. These stars populate three distinct\nsequences in the Petersen diagram. The origin of this secondary modulation is\nstill unknown.

The two\nmost widely used relative age-dating methods, horizontal and vertical, together\nwith the more recent relative MS-fitting method, were carefully analyzed on a\npurely theoretical basis. The BaSTI library was adopted to perform the present\nanalysis. We find that relative ages derived using the horizontal and vertical\nmethods are largely dependent on the initial He content and heavy element\ndistribution. Unrecognized cluster-to-cluster chemical abundance differences\ncan lead to an error in the derived relative ages as large as ~0.5 (or ~6 Gyr\nif an age of 12.8 Gyr is adopted for normalization), and even larger for some\nextreme cases. It is shown that the relative MS-fitting method is by far the\nage-dating technique for which undetected cluster-to-cluster differences in the\nHe abundance have less impact.

We find that,\ndespite the impact of tidal interaction on the rotation of primary stars, the\namount of angular momentum retained in the core at the presupernova stage in\ndifferent binary model sequences converge to a value similar to those found in\nprevious single star models. This amount is large enough to produce millisecond\npulsars, but too small to produce magnetars or long gamma-ray bursts. We employ\nthe most up-to-date estimate for the Wolf-Rayet mass loss rate, and its\nimplications for SN Ib/c progenitors are discussed in detail. In terms of\nstellar structure, SN Ib/c progenitors in binary systems are predicted to have\na wide range of final masses even up to 7 Msun, with helium envelopes of 0.16 -\n1.5 Msun. Our results indicate that, if the lack of helium lines in the spectra\nof SNe Ic were due to small amounts of helium, the distribution of both initial\nand final masses of SN Ic progenitors should be bimodal. Furthermore, we find\nthat a thin hydrogen layer (0.001 - 0.01 Msun) is expected to be present in\nmany SN Ib progenitors at the presupernova stage. We show that the presence of\nhydrogen, together with a rather thick helium envelope, can lead to a\nsignificant expansion of some SN Ib/c progenitors by the time of supernova\nexplosion.

When the scale factor of fifth dimension and scalar field are not\nconstants, 5D eqs for any geometry admit a power law relation between scalar\nfield and scale factor of fifth dimension.

Compared\nto its twins, the Sun exhibits a deficiency of refractory elements (those with\ncondensation temperatures Tc>900K) relative to volatiles (Tc<900K). This\nfinding is speculated to be a signature of the planet formation that occurred\nmore efficiently around the Sun compared with the majority of solar twins.\nFurthermore, within this scenario, it seems more likely that the abundance\npatterns found are specifically related to the formation of terrestrial\nplanets. In this work we analyze abundance results from six large independent\nstellar abundance surveys to determine whether they confirm or reject this\nobservational finding. We show that the elemental abundances derived for solar\nanalogs in these six studies are consistent with the Tc trend suggested as a\nplanet formation signature. The same conclusion is reached when those results\nare averaged heterogeneously. We also investigate the dependency of the\nabundances with first ionization potential (FIP), which correlates well with\nTc. A trend with FIP would suggest a different origin for the abundance\npatterns found, but we show that the correlation with Tc is statistically more\nsignificant. We encourage similar investigations of metal-rich solar analogs\nand late F-type dwarf stars, for which the hypothesis of a planet formation\nsignature in the elemental abundances makes very specific predictions. Finally,\nwe examine a recent paper that claims that the abundance patterns of two stars\nhosting super-Earth like planets contradict the planet formation signature\nhypothesis. Instead, we find that the chemical compositions of these two stars\nare fully compatible with our hypothesis. \n\n"}

Given that the planet orbits a\nsolar-like star at a distance of on ly 4.5 R*, it is expected that material\nreleased from its surface may then form an exosphere.

We consider two scenarios: (1) the stellar magnetic field\nis strong enough to confine the hot coronal plasma out to the planetary orbit\nand (2) the stellar magnetic field is unable to confine the plasma, which\nescapes in a wind. In both cases, a shock capable of compressing plasma to the\nobserved densities will form around the planet for plasma temperatures T < (4 -\n5) x 10^6 K. In the confined case, the shock always forms directly ahead of the\nplanet, but in the wind case the shock orientation depends on the wind speed\nand hence on the plasma temperature. For higher wind temperatures, the shock\nforms closer to the line of centers between the planet and the star.

The 3D geometry of these\nray-like features is largely unknown and its knowledge should clarify their\nassociation to the CS and place constraints on CME physics and coronal\nconditions.

The ray was observed in the aftermath of a CME\nwhich occurred on 9 April 2008. The twin STEREO spacecraft were separated by\nabout degrees on that day. This significant separation combined with a third\n\"eye\" view supplied by LASCO allow for a truly multi-viewpoint observation of\nthe ray and of the CME. We applied 3D forward geometrical modeling to the CME\nand to the ray as simultaneously viewed by SECCHI-A and B and by SECCHI-A and\nLASCO, respectively.

The ongoing production of radioactive nuclei in\nthe deep interior of the Sun via proton-capture reactions is recorded by\nneutrinos emitted during radioactive decay and detected on Earth.

This is the final phase in the\nevolution of stars initially less massive than ~10 solar masses, during which\nnuclear energy is produced by alternate hydrogen and helium burning in shells\nabove the core. The long-lived radioactive nucleus 26Al is produced in massive\nAGB stars (>4:5 solar masses), where the base of the convective envelope\nreaches high temperatures.

The physical\norigin of the effect has been a puzzle ever since its discovery over a hundred\nyears ago. We build here upon the recent observational and theoretical work of\nSzabo et al. on RRab stars who found with hydrodynamical simulations that the\nfundamental pulsation mode can get destabilized by a 9:2 resonant interaction\nwith the 9th overtone. Alternating pulsation cycles arise, although these\nremain periodic, i.e. not modulated as in the observations.\n  Here we use the amplitude equation formalism to study this nonlinear,\nresonant interaction between the two modes. We show that not only does the\nfundamental pulsation mode break up into a period two cycle through the\nnonlinear, resonant interaction with the overtone, but that the amplitudes are\nmodulated, and that in a broad range of parameters the modulations are\nirregular as in the observations. This irregular behavior is in fact chaotic\nand arises from a strange attractor in the dynamics. \n\n"}

Mid-IR observations, which span the peak of the\nthermal spectral energy distribution, provide useful constraints on the\nproperties of the dust and, ultimately, the circumstellar environment,\nexplosion mechanism, and progenitor system.

This article presents results from a warm Spitzer/IRAC\nsurvey of the positions of all 68 known SNe IIn within a distance of 250 Mpc\nbetween 1999 and 2008 that have remained unobserved by Spitzer more than 100\ndays post-discovery.

Thus, changes in stellar NIR-MIR colors due to interstellar reddening\nare readily apparent, and (under an assumed extinction law) the observed colors\nand magnitudes of stars can be easily and accurately restored to their\nintrinsic values, greatly increasing their usefulness for Galactic structure\nstudies. In this paper we explore this \"Rayleigh-Jeans Color Excess\" (RJCE)\nmethod and demonstrate that use of even a simple variant of the RJCE method\nbased on a single reference color, (H-[4.5um]), can rather accurately remove\ndust effects from previously uninterpretable 2MASS color-magnitude diagrams of\nstars in fields along the heavily reddened Galactic mid-plane, with results far\nsuperior to those derived from application of other dereddening methods.

For each chemical composition we\nconstructed a grid of fundamental (FU) and first overtone (FO) models covering\na broad range of stellar masses and luminosities. To constrain the impact of\nthe helium content on RR Lyrae properties, we adopted two observables --period\ndistribution, luminosity amplitudes-- that are independent of distance and\nreddening. The current predictions confirm that the helium content has a\nmarginal effect on the pulsation properties. The key parameter causing the\ndifference between canonical and He-enhanced observables is the luminosity. We\ncompared current predictions with the sample of 189 RR Lyrae stars in omega Cen\nand we found that the period range of He-enhanced models is systematically\nlonger than observed. These findings apply to metal-poor and metal-intermediate\nHe-enhanced models.

We perform the first realistic\nN-body computations of fully mass-segregated R136-type star clusters in which\nall the massive stars are in primordial binary systems. These calculations\nconfirm that the dynamical ejection of a VMS from a R136-like cluster, with\nkinematic properties similar to those of VFTS 682, is common.

Applying this to the Solar\nSystem, we determine that the planets are close to optimally separated for\nscattering particles between them. Concerning warm dust found around stars that\nalso have Kuiper belt analogues, we show that, if there is to be a dynamical\nlink between the outer and inner regions, then certain architectures for the\nintervening planetary system are incapable of producing the observations.\nFurthermore we show that for certain planetary systems, comets can be scattered\nfrom an outer belt, or with fewer constraints, from an Oort cloud analogue,\nonto star-grazing orbits, in support of a planetary origin to the metal\npollution and dustiness of some nearby white dwarfs. \n\n"}

Abstract: Parenago 1802, a member of the ~1 Myr Orion Nebula Cluster, is a\ndouble-lined, detached eclipsing binary in a 4.674 d orbit, with equal-mass\ncomponents (M_2/M_1 = 0.985 \\pm 0.029). Here we present extensive VIcJHKs light\ncurves spanning ~15 yr, as well as a Keck/HIRES optical spectrum. The light\ncurves evince a third light source that is variable with a period of 0.73 d,\nand is also manifested in the high-resolution spectrum, strongly indicating the\npresence of a third star in the system, probably a rapidly rotating classical T\nTauri star. We incorporate this third light into our radial velocity and light\ncurve modeling of the eclipsing pair, measuring accurate masses (M_1 = 0.391\n\\pm 0.032, M_2 = 0.385 \\pm 0.032 M\\odot), radii (R_1 = 1.73 \\pm 0.02, R_2 =\n1.62 \\pm 0.02 R\\odot), and temperature ratio (T_1/T_2 = 1.0924 \\pm 0.0017).\nThus the radii of the eclipsing stars differ by 6.9 \\pm 0.8%, the temperatures\ndiffer by 9.2 \\pm 0.2%, and consequently the luminosities differ by 62 \\pm 3%,\ndespite having masses equal to within 3%. This could be indicative of an age\ndifference of ~3x10^5 yr between the two eclipsing stars, perhaps a vestige of\nthe binary formation history. We find that the eclipsing pair is in an orbit\nthat has not yet fully circularized, e = 0.0166 \\pm 0.003. In addition, we\nmeasure the rotation rate of the eclipsing stars to be 4.629 \\pm 0.006 d; they\nrotate slightly faster than their 4.674 d orbit. The non-zero eccentricity and\nsuper-synchronous rotation suggest that the eclipsing pair should be tidally\ninteracting, so we calculate the tidal history of the system according to\ndifferent tidal evolution theories. We find that tidal heating effects can\nexplain the observed luminosity difference of the eclipsing pair, providing an\nalternative to the previously suggested age difference. \n\n"}

Abstract: Magnetic Doppler imaging is currently the most powerful method of\ninterpreting high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of stars. This\ntechnique has revealed the presence of unexpected small-scale magnetic fields\non the surfaces of Ap stars. These studies were recently criticisied by Stift\net al. (2012), who claimed that magnetic inversions are not robust and are\nundermined by neglecting a feedback on the Stokes line profiles from the local\natmospheric structure in the regions of enhanced metal abundance. We show that\nStift et al. misinterpreted published magnetic Doppler imaging results and\nneglected some of the most fundamental principles behind magnetic mapping. We\ndemonstrate that the variation of atmospheric structure across the surface of a\nstar with chemical spots affects the local continuum intensity but is\nnegligible for the normalised local Stokes profiles. For the disk-integrated\nspectra of an Ap star with extreme abundance variations, we find that the\nassumption of a mean model atmosphere leads to moderate errors in Stokes I but\nis negligible for polarisation spectra. Employing a new magnetic inversion\ncode, which incorporates the horizontal variation of atmospheric structure, we\nreconstructed new maps of magnetic field and Fe abundance for the Ap star\nalpha^2 CVn. The resulting distribution of chemical spots changes\ninsignificantly compared to the previous modelling based on a single model\natmosphere, while the magnetic field geometry does not change at all. This\nshows that the assertions by Stift et al. are exaggerated as a consequence of\nunreasonable assumptions and extrapolations, as well as methodological flaws\nand inconsistencies of their analysis. Our discussion proves that published\nmagnetic inversions based on a mean stellar atmosphere are robust and reliable,\nand that the presence of small-scale magnetic field structures on the surfaces\nof Ap stars is real. \n\n"}

Our non-rotating models become redder than the previous\nmodels in the literature, given the larger overshooting parameter adopted in\nthis study. In particular, convective dredge-up of the helium core material\ninto the hydrogen envelope is observed in our non-rotating very massive star\nmodels (>~200 Msun), which is potentially important for the chemical yields. On\nthe other hand, the stars become bluer and more luminous with a higher\nrotational velocity. With the Spruit-Tayler dynamo, our models with a\nsufficiently high initial rotational velocity can reach the critical rotation\nearlier and lose more mass as a result, compared to the previous models without\nmagnetic fields. The most dramatic effect of rotation is found with the\nso-called chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE), which is observed for a\nlimited mass and rotational velocity range. CHE has several important\nconsequences: 1) Both primary nitrogen and ionizing photons are abundantly\nproduced. 2) Conditions for gamma-ray burst progenitors are fulfilled for an\ninitial mass range of 13 - 84 Msun. 3) Pair instability supernovae of type Ibc\nare expected for 84 -190 Msun and 4) Both a pulsational pair instability\nsupernova and a GRB may occur from the same progenitor of about 56 - 84 Msun,\nwhich might significantly influence the consequent GRB afterglow.

Three of the four pulsars\nare in binary systems with low-mass companions, which are most likely white\ndwarfs, and which have orbital periods on the order of days. The fourth pulsar\nis isolated. All four pulsars have large dispersion measures (DM > 100 pc\ncm-3), are distant (> 3.4 kpc), faint at 1.4 GHz (< 0.2 mJy), and are fully\nrecycled (with spin periods P between 3.5 and 4.9 ms). The three binaries also\nhave very small orbital eccentricities, as expected for tidally circularized,\nfully recycled systems with low-mass companions. These four pulsars have DM/P\nratios that are among the highest values for field MSPs in the Galaxy. These\ndiscoveries bring the total number of confirmed MSPs from the PALFA survey to\nfifteen.

The systems include cooling flow (CF)\nclusters of galaxies, core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), planetary nebulae\n(PNe), and common envelope (CE) evolution. The similarities include hot bubbles\ninflated by jets in a bipolar structure, vortices on the sides of the jets,\nvortices inside the inflated bubbles, fragmentation of bubbles to two and more\nbubbles, and buoyancy of bubbles. The activity in many cases is regulated by a\nnegative feedback mechanism. Namely, higher accretion rate leads to stronger\njet activity that in turn suppresses the accretion process.

The light curve exhibits an abrupt\ntransition from a well-defined ~120 day plateau to a steep bolometric decline.\nLeading up to peak brightness, a hot emission-line spectrum exhibits signs of\ninteraction with circumstellar material (CSM), in the form of relatively narrow\nP-Cygni features of H I and He I superimposed on broad Lorentzian wings. For\nthe remainder of the plateau phase the spectrum exhibits strengthening P-Cygni\nprofiles of Fe II, Ca II, and H-alpha. By day 147, after the plateau has ended,\nthe SN entered the nebular phase, heralded by the appearance of forbidden\ntransitions of [O I], [O II], and [Ca II] over a weak continuum. At this stage,\nthe light curve exhibits a low luminosity that is comparable to that\nsub-luminous Type II-P supernovae, and a relatively fast visual-wavelength\ndecline that is significantly steeper than the Co-56 decay rate. However, the\ntotal bolometric decline, including the IR luminosity, is consistent with Co-56\ndecay, and implies a low Ni-56 mass of ~0.01 M(Sun). We therefore characterize\nSN 2011ht as a bona-fide core-collapse SN very similar to the peculiar SNe IIn\n1994W and 2009kn.

Much of this soft hot gas is likely to be from\nlocal active star-forming regions; however, besides the nuclear region, the\nmorphology of hot gas does not strongly correlate with sites of active star\nformation.

We interpret the hard\ncomponent as being of thermal origin with kT_e~3.6keV and to be directly\nassociated with a wind fluid produced by supernovae and massive star winds. The\ninferred terminal velocity for this hard component, ~1100 km/s, exceeds the\nlocal galaxy escape velocity suggesting a potential outflow. The softer\nextended emission does not display an obvious outflow geometry. However, the\ncolumn density through which the X-rays are transmitted is lower to the west of\nthe nucleus compared to the east and the surface brightness is higher there\nsuggesting some soft hot gas originates from above the disk; viewed directly\nfrom the western zone but through the intervening galaxy disk from the eastern\nzone.

Taking a distance to the cloud of 415 pc rather than 259 pc, the\ndistribution of ages is shifted to lower values, in the 1-3 Myr range, with a\ntail up to 10 Myr. The mass distribution spans 0.2-1.2 Msun, with median mass\nof 0.7 Msun. The distribution of fractional disk luminosities in Serpens\nresembles that of the young Taurus Molecular Cloud, with most disks consistent\nwith optically thick, passively irradiated disks in a variety of disk\ngeometries (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.1). In contrast, the distributions for the older\nUpper Scorpius and Eta Chamaeleontis clusters are dominated by optically thin\nlower luminosity disks (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.02). This evolution in fractional disk\nluminosities is concurrent with that of disk fractions. The actively accreting\nand non-accreting stars (based on Ha data) in Serpens show very similar\ndistributions in fractional disk luminosities, differing only in the brighter\ntail dominated by strongly accreting stars. In contrast with a sample of Herbig\nAe/Be stars, the T Tauri stars in Serpens do not have a clear separation in\nfractional disk luminosities for different disk geometries: both flared and\nflat disks present wider, overlapping distributions. This result is consistent\nwith previous suggestions of a faster evolution for disks around Herbig Ae/Be\nstars. Furthermore, the results for the mineralogy of the dust in the disk\nsurface do not show any correlation to either stellar and disk characteristics\nor mean cluster age in the 1-10 Myr range probed here. A possible explanation\nfor the lack of correlation is that the processes affecting the dust within\ndisks have short timescales, happening repeatedly, making it difficult to\ndistinguish long lasting evolutionary effects.

Abstract: Based on kinematic data observed for very young, massive clusters that appear\nto be in dynamical equilibrium, it has recently been argued that such young\nsystems set examples where the early residual gas-expulsion did not happen or\nhad no dynamical effect. The intriguing scenario of a star cluster forming\nthrough a single starburst has thereby been challenged. Choosing the case of\nthe R136 cluster of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the most cited one in this\ncontext, we perform direct N-body computations that mimic the early evolution\nof this cluster including the gas-removal phase (on a thermal timescale). Our\ncalculations show that under plausible initial conditions as consistent from\nobservational data, a large fraction (> 60%) of a gas-expelled, expanding\nR136-like cluster is bound to regain dynamical equilibrium by its current age.\nTherefore, the recent measurements of velocity dispersion in the inner regions\nof R136, that indicate that the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium, are\nconsistent with an earlier substantial gas expulsion of R136 followed by a\nrapid re-virialization (in approx. 1 Myr). Additionally, we find that the less\nmassive Galactic NGC 3603 Young Cluster (NYC), with a substantially longer\nre-virialization time, is likely to be found deviated from dynamical\nequilibrium at its present age (approx. 1 Myr). The recently obtained stellar\nproper motions in the central part of the NYC indeed suggest this and are\nconsistent with the computed models. This work significantly extends previous\nmodels of the Orion Nebula Cluster which already demonstrated that the\nre-virialization time of young post-gas-expulsion clusters decreases with\nincreasing pre-expulsion density. \n\n"}

The apsidal motion of a binary system with an eccentric\norbit provides information regarding the interior structure constants of the\nindividual stars. These constants are related to the normalized stellar\ninterior density distribution and can be extracted from the predictions of\nstellar evolution models. We demonstrate that low-mass, pre-main sequence stars\nundergoing radiative core contraction display rapidly changing interior\nstructure constants (greater than 5% per 10 Myr) that, when combined with\nobservational determinations of the interior structure constants (with 5 -- 10%\nprecision), allow for a robust age estimate.

These reductions\ntranslate to smaller SFR estimates made from observed UV and Halpha\nluminosities.

In this study, we present the first\nsteps toward creating three-dimensional magneto-hydrostatic prominence model\nwhere the prominence is formed in the dips of a coronal flux tube. Here 2.5D\nequilibria are created by adding mass to an initially force-free magnetic\nfield, then performing a secondary magnetohydrodynamic relaxation. Two inverse\npolarity magnetic field configurations are studied in detail, a simple o-point\nconfiguration with a ratio of the horizontal field (B_x) to the axial field\n(B_y) of 1:2 and a more complex model that also has an x-point with a ratio of\n1:11.

The o-point of the coronal flux tube was pulled down by the\nprominence material, leading to compression of the magnetic field at the base\nof the prominence. Therefore tension support comes from the small curvature of\nthe compressed magnetic field at the bottom and the larger curvature of the\nstretched magnetic field at the top of the prominence.

The clumps show, for the first time in a \"dense\ngas tracer\", a significant correlation between HCO+ line emission from cold\nmolecular gas and Br{\\gamma} line emission of associated nebulae. This\ncorrelation arises in the HCO+ line's brightness, not its linewidth. In\ncontrast, the correlation between the N2H+ line emission and Br{\\gamma} is weak\nor absent. The HCO+/N2H+ line ratio also varies widely from clump to clump:\nbright HCO+ emission tends to be more closely associated with Br{\\gamma}\nnebulosity, while bright N2H+ emission tends to avoid areas that are bright in\nBr{\\gamma}. Both molecular species show correlations of weak significance with\ninfrared H2 v=1-0 and v=2-1 line emission, in or near the clumps. The H2\nemission line ratio is consistent with fluorescent excitation in most of the\nclumps, although thermal excitation is seen in a few clumps.

This is largely related to\ntwo phenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likely\nhigh-metallicity GRB hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack of\nefficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies including\nmetallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the GRB host population.\nThe subject of this work is the very energetic GRB 110918A, for which we\nmeasure a redshift of z=0.984. GRB 110918A gave rise to a luminous afterglow\nwith an intrinsic spectral slope of b=0.70, which probed a sight-line with\nlittle extinction (A_V=0.16 mag) typical of the established distributions of\nafterglow properties.

Generalizing the Newtonian theory, we show\nthat wave absorption can take place at the corotation resonance, where the\npattern frequency of the wave matches the background disc rotation rate. We\nderive the general relativistic expression for the disc vortensity (vorticity\ndivided by surface density), which governs the behaviour of density\nperturbation near corotation. Depending on the gradient of the generalized disc\nvortensity, corotational wave absorption can lead to the amplification or\ndamping of the spiral wave. We apply our general theory of relativistic wave\ndynamics to calculate the non-axisymmetric inertial-acoustic modes (also called\np-modes) trapped in the inner-most region of a black hole accretion disc.\nBecause general relativity changes the profiles of the radial epicyclic\nfrequency and disc vortensity near the inner disc edge close to the black hole,\nthese p-modes can become overstable under appropriate conditions. We present\nthe numerical results of the frequencies and growth rates of p-modes for\nvarious black hole spin and model disc parameters (the surface density profile\nand sound speed), and discuss their implications for understanding the\nenigmatic high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in black hole\nX-ray binaries. \n\n"}

The phenomenology of such\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretors is particularly rich when an accretion\ndisc forms around the secondary. The outer radius of such discs is commonly\nestimated from the net angular momentum produced by a density variation of\nmaterial across the BHL or Bondi accretion cylinder, as the latter is tilted\nwith respect to the direction to the primary due to orbital motion. But this\napproach has ignored the fact that the wind experiences an outward driving\nforce that the secondary does not. In actuality, the accretion stream falls\ntoward a retarded point in the secondary's orbit as the secondary is pulled\ntoward the primary relative to the stream. The result is a finite separation or\n\"accretion stream impact parameter\" (ASIP) separating the secondary and stream.\nWhen the orbital radius a_o exceeds the BHL radius r_b, the ratio of outer disc\nradius estimated as the ASIP to the conventional estimate\na_o^{1/2}/r_b^{1/2}>1. We therefore predict that discs will form at larger\nradii from the secondary than traditional estimates. This agrees with the\nimportance of the ASIP emphasized by Huarte-Espinosa et al.

This is in contrast to many older\nstar clusters that show a decreasing binary frequency with radius. We study\nthis phenomenon with sophisticated N-body modeling, exploring a range of\ninitial conditions, from smooth virialized density distributions to highly\nsubstructured and collapsing configurations. We find that many of these models\ncan reproduce the cluster's observed properties, although with a modest\npreference for substructured initial conditions. Our models produce the\nobserved radial trend in binary frequency through disruption of soft binaries\n(with semi-major axes, a > 3000 AU), on approximately a crossing time (~ 5.4\nMyr), preferentially in the cluster core. Mass segregation subsequently causes\nthe binaries to sink towards the core. After roughly one initial half-mass\nrelaxation time (t_rh(0) ~ 340 Myr) the radial binary frequency distribution\nbecomes bimodal, the innermost binaries having already segregated towards the\ncore, leaving a minimum in the radial binary frequency distribution that\nmarches outwards with time. After 4-6 t_rh(0), the rising distribution in the\nhalo disappears, leaving a radial distribution that rises only towards the\ncore. Thus, both a radial binary frequency distribution that falls towards the\ncore (as observed for NGC 1818) and one that rises towards the core (as for\nolder star clusters) can arise naturally from the same evolutionary sequence\nowing to binary disruption and mass segregation in rich star clusters. \n\n"}

The\n  Evolutionary Sequence Abstract: We present radiation transfer (RT) simulations of evolutionary sequences of\nmassive protostars forming from massive dense cores in environments of high\nsurface densities. The protostellar evolution is calculated with a detailed\nmulti-zone model, with the accretion rate regulated by feedback from an\nevolving disk-wind outflow cavity. Disk and envelope evolutions are calculated\nself-consistently. In this framework, an evolutionary track is determined by\nthree environmental initial conditions: the initial core mass M_c, the mean\nsurface density of the ambient star-forming clump Sigma_cl, and the\nrotational-to-gravitational energy ratio of the initial core, beta_c.\nEvolutionary sequences with various M_c, Sigma_cl, beta_c are constructed. We\nfind that in a fiducial model with M_c=60Msun, Sigma_cl=1 g/cm^2 and\nbeta_c=0.02, the final star formation efficiency >~0.43. For each evolutionary\ntrack, RT simulations are performed at selected stages, with temperature\nprofiles, SEDs, and images produced. At a given stage the envelope temperature\nis highly dependent on Sigma_cl, but only weakly dependent on M_c. The SED and\nMIR images depend sensitively on the evolving outflow cavity, which gradually\nwides as the protostar grows. The fluxes at <~100 microns increase\ndramatically, and the far-IR peaks move to shorter wavelengths. We find that,\ndespite scatter caused by different M_c, Sigma_cl, beta, and inclinations,\nsources at a given evolutionary stage appear in similar regions on color-color\ndiagrams, especially when using colors at >~ 70 microns, where the scatter due\nto the inclination is minimized, implying that such diagrams can be useful\ndiagnostic tools of evolutionary stages of massive protostars.

Such ordered fields\ncan be measured in the case of planets, stars, and galaxies, or inferred\nindirectly by the action of their dynamical influence, such as jets. Whether\nlarge scale fields are amplified in situ or a remnant from previous stages of\nan object's history is often debated for objects without a definitive magnetic\nactivity cycle. Magnetic helicity, a measure of twist and linkage of magnetic\nfield lines, is a unifying tool for understanding large scale field evolution\nfor both mechanisms of origin. Its importance stems from its two basic\nproperties: (1) magnetic helicity is typically better conserved than magnetic\nenergy; and (2) the magnetic energy associated with a fixed amount of magnetic\nhelicity is minimized when the system relaxes this helical structure to the\nlargest scale available. Here I discuss how magnetic helicity has come to help\nus understand the saturation of and sustenance of large scale dynamos, the need\nfor either local or global helicity fluxes to avoid dynamo quenching, and the\nassociated observational consequences.

Results show that while most SED parameters decrease with radius, the\nemissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but in\nothers is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outer\nones. Despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of the\nphysically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectral\nslopes with beta<= 1. We find that flatter slopes (beta<= 1.5) are associated\nwith cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usual\nTdust-beta degeneracy. This trend is related to variations in Umin since beta\nand Umin are very closely linked over the entire range in Umin sampled by the\nKINGFISH galaxies: low Umin is associated with flat beta<=1.

This requires short prestellar core lifetimes of less than about 0.1Myr. The\nwater vapour profile is shaped through the interplay of FUV photodesorption,\nphotodissociation, and freeze-out. The water vapour line profiles are an\ninvaluable tracer for the FUV photon flux and envelope kinematics.\n  Conclusions: The finding that only a fraction of the oxygen budget is locked\nin water ice can be explained either by a short pre-collapse time of less than\n0.1 Myr at densities of n(H)~1e4 cm-3, or by some other process that resets the\ninitial water ice abundance for the post-collapse phase. A key for the\nunderstanding of the water ice abundance is the binding energy of atomic oxygen\non ice. \n\n"}

Although some\nof these parameters were explored, most previous works assumed that the gas is\nisothermal. However, we know that cold molecular clouds form out of the warm\natomic medium, with the gas passing through chemical and thermodynamic phases\nthat are not isothermal. Here we determine the role of temperature variations\nby modelling non-isothermal turbulence with a polytropic equation of state\n(EOS), where pressure and temperature are functions of gas density,\nP~rho^Gamma, T~rho^(Gamma-1). We use grid resolutions of 2048^3 cells and\ncompare polytropic exponents Gamma=0.7 (soft EOS), Gamma=1 (isothermal EOS),\nand Gamma=5/3 (stiff EOS). We find a complex network of non-isothermal\nfilaments with more small-scale fragmentation occurring for Gamma<1, while\nGamma>1 smoothes out density contrasts. The density probability distribution\nfunction (PDF) is significantly affected by temperature variations, with a\npower-law tail developing at low densities for Gamma>1. In contrast, the PDF\nbecomes closer to a lognormal distribution for Gamma<=1. We derive and test a\nnew density variance - Mach number relation that takes Gamma into account. This\nnew relation is relevant for theoretical models of the SFR and IMF, because it\ndetermines the dense gas mass fraction of a cloud, from which stars form. We\nderive the SFR as a function of Gamma and find that it decreases by a factor of\n~5 from Gamma=0.7 to Gamma=5/3. \n\n"}

Our aim is to calculate the posterior probability\ndistributions for the mass and age of a star given its density, effective\ntemperature, metallicity and luminosity.

This sample doubles the\nnumber of dSph stars with measurements of [C/Fe]. The [C/Fe] ratio in the\nclusters decreases with increasing luminosity above log(L/L_sun) ~= 1.6, which\ncan be explained by deep mixing in evolved giants.

We hypothesize\nthat [C/Fe] (corrected to the initial carbon abundance) declines with\nincreasing [Fe/H] due to the metallicity dependence of the carbon yield of\nasymptotic giant branch stars and due to the increasing importance of Type Ia\nsupernovae at higher metallicities. We also identified 11 very carbon-rich\ngiants (8 previously known) in three dSphs.

To overcome this problem\none can use subgrid-scale (SGS) closures -- models for the influence of\nunresolved, subgrid-scales on the resolved ones. In this work we propose and\nvalidate a set of constant coefficient closures for the resolved, compressible,\nideal MHD equations. The subgrid-scale energies are modeled by Smagorinsky-like\nequilibrium closures. The turbulent stresses and the electromotive force (EMF)\nare described by expressions that are nonlinear in terms of large scale\nvelocity and magnetic field gradients. To verify the closures we conduct a\npriori tests over 137 simulation snapshots from two different codes with\nvarying ratios of thermal to magnetic pressure ($\\beta_\\mathrm{p} = 0.25, 1,\n2.5, 5, 25$) and sonic Mach numbers ($M_s = 2, 2.5, 4$).

Our\napproach combines detection of stream overdensities by a\nDifference-of-Gaussians process with fast streakline models, a continuous\nlikelihood function built from these models, and inference with MCMC. By\ngenerating $\\approx10^7$ model streams, we show that the geometry of the Pal 5\ndebris yields powerful constraints on the solar position and motion, the Milky\nWay and Pal 5 itself. All 10 model parameters were allowed to vary over large\nranges without additional prior information.

The ratio of primordial to enriched\nstars thus has a U-shaped dependency on radius with a minimum near the\nhalf-light radius. N-body simulations show that mass segregation might produce\na trend resembling the observed one, but only if the N-enhanced giants are\n~0.25 Mo less massive than the primordial giants, which requires extreme He\nenhancement (Y~0.40).

Thus the fate of\nrapidly-accreting Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs in the single-degenerate\nchannel remains more mysterious then ever. In this paper, we clarify the nature\nof ignition in Chandrasekhar-mass single-degenerate SNe Ia by analytically\nderiving the existence of a characteristic length scale which establishes a\ntransition from central ignitions to buoyancy-driven ignitions. Using this\ncriterion, combined with data from three-dimensional simulations of convection\nand ignition, we demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of ignition events\nwithin Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs in the single-degenerate channel are\nbuoyancy-driven, and consequently lack a vigorous deflagration phase.

The feedback from stellar winds and dying\nstars is followed in detail. In particular, a novel and detailed approach has\nbeen developed to trace the aging of various stellar populations, which enables\nan accurate calculation of the stellar feedback depending on the stellar age.\nWe build initial equilibrium models of dwarf galaxies that take gas\nself-gravity into account and present different levels of rotational support.\nModels with high rotational support develop prominent bipolar outflows; a\nnewly-born stellar population in these models is preferentially concentrated to\nthe galactic midplane.

Estimating distances is an inference problem in which the use\nof prior assumptions is unavoidable. I investigate the properties and\nperformance of various priors and examine their implications.

In this article, we construct quasi-equilibrium\nconfigurations for different spins, eccentricities, mass ratios, compactnesses,\nand equations of state. For this purpose we employ the SGRID code, which allows\nus to construct such data in previously inaccessible regions of the parameter\nspace. In particular, we consider spinning neutron stars in isolation and in\nbinary systems; we incorporate new methods to produce highly eccentric and\neccentricity reduced data; we present the possibility of computing data for\nsignificantly unequal-mass binaries; and we create equal-mass binaries with\nindividual compactness up to 0.23. As a proof of principle, we explore the\ndynamical evolution of three new configurations. First, we simulate a $q=2.06$\nmass ratio which is the highest mass ratio for a binary neutron star evolved in\nnumerical relativity to date. We find that mass transfer from the companion\nstar sets in a few revolutions before merger and a rest mass of\n$\\sim10^{-2}M_\\odot$ is transferred between the two stars. This configuration\nalso ejects a large amount of material during merger, imparting a substantial\nkick to the remnant. Second, we simulate the first merger of a precessing\nbinary neutron star. We present the dominant modes of the gravitational waves\nfor the precessing simulation, where a clear imprint of the precession is\nvisible in the (2,1) mode. Finally, we quantify the effect of an eccentricity\nreduction procedure on the gravitational waveform.

Upon its destruction, a fraction of this energy is extracted\nand injected into the stellar debris, half of which becomes unbound from the\nblack hole, with the fastest material moving at $\\sim 0.03 c$. In this paper,\nwe present a formalism for determining the fate of these unbound debris streams\n(UDSs) as they depart from the black hole and interact with the surrounding\ngas. As the density and velocity varies along the length of a UDS, we find that\nhydrodynamical drag quickly shapes UDSs into loop-like structures, with the\ndensest portions of the streams leading portions of lower density. As UDSs\ntravel outwards, their drag against the ISM increases quadratically with\ndistance, which causes UDSs to deposit their momentum and energy into the\nambient medium before the surrounding shocked ISM has a chance to cool. This\nsudden injection of $\\sim 10^{50}$ erg into the ambient medium generates a\nSedov-like unbound debris remnant (UDR) that mimics supernova remnants (SNRs)\nin energetics and appearance, accelerates particles which will produce cosmic\nrays and synchrotron emission, and provides momentum feedback into the\nmolecular clouds surrounding a black hole.

We use\nasteroseismic data of red giants, observed by Kepler, to test the current\ntheoretical framework of modelling the Galaxy based on population synthesis\nmodeling and the use of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants.

Gravitational collapse of a\npre-stellar core forms both a central star and a protoplanetary disk. The\ncentral star grows by accretion from the disk, and irradiation by the central\nstar heats up the disk and generates thermal wind, which results in the disk\ndispersal. We calculate the evolution of protoplanetary disks from their parent\npre-stellar cores to dispersal of the disks.

The goal of this work is to use less\nabundant CO isotopologues, whose detection is routine for ALMA, to infer the\ngas mass of disks. Isotope-selective effects need to be taken into account in\nthe analysis, because they can significantly modify CO isotopologues line\nintensities. CO isotope-selective photodissociation has been implemented in the\nphysical-chemical code DALI and 800 disk models have been run for a range of\ndisk and stellar parameters. Dust and gas temperature structures have been\ncomputed self-consistently, together with a chemical calculation of the main\nspecies. Both disk structure and stellar parameters have been investigated.\nTotal fluxes have been ray-traced for different CO isotopologues and for\nvarious transitions for different inclinations. A combination of 13CO and C18O\ntotal intensities allows inference of the total disk mass, although with\nnon-negligible uncertainties. These can be overcome by employing spatially\nresolved observations, i.e. the disk's radial extent and inclination.\nComparison with parametric models shows differences at the factor of a few\nlevel, especially for extremely low and high disk masses. Finally, total line\nintensities for different CO isotopologue and for various low-J transitions are\nprovided and are fitted to simple formulae. The effects of a lower gas-phase\ncarbon abundance and different gas/dust ratios are investigated as well, and\ncomparison with other tracers is made.

Here we present the stellar kinematics of Dragonfly 44, one of the\nlargest Coma UDGs, using a 33.5 hr integration with DEIMOS on the Keck II\ntelescope.

The mass-to-light ratio is M/L=48 M_sun/L_sun, and the dark\nmatter fraction is 98 percent within the half-light radius. The high mass of\nDragonfly 44 is accompanied by a large globular cluster population.

Ionizing\nradiation from faint galaxies likely drives cosmic reionization, and the HFF\ninitiative provides a key opportunity to find such galaxies. Yet, we cannot\nreally assess their ionizing emissivity without a robust measurement of their\nsizes, since this is key to quantifying both their prevalence and the faint-end\nslope to the UV luminosity function.

The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr.

In\nthe context of Galactic archeology, stellar ages provide a direct probe of the\nformation history of the Galaxy. We use the stellar evolution code MESA to\ncompute models with atomic diffusion--with and without radiative\nacceleration--and extra mixing in the surface layers. The extra mixing consists\nof both density-dependent turbulent mixing and envelope overshoot mixing. Based\non these models we argue that it is important to distinguish between initial,\nbulk abundances (parameters) and current, surface abundances (variables) in the\nanalysis of individual stellar ages. In stars that maintain radiative regions\non evolutionary timescales, atomic diffusion modifies the surface abundances.\nWe show that when initial, bulk metallicity is equated with current, surface\nmetallicity in isochrone age analysis the resulting stellar ages can be\nsystematically over-estimated by up to 20%. The change of surface abundances\nwith evolutionary phase also complicates chemical tagging, the concept that\ndispersed star clusters can be identified through unique, high-dimensional\nchemical signatures. Stars from the same cluster, but in different evolutionary\nphases, will show different surface abundances. We speculate that calibration\nof stellar models may allow us to estimate not only stellar ages but also\ninitial abundances for individual stars.

We first analyze the\nSDSS and LAMOST spectra. A first set of stellar parameters is derived from\nthese spectra with the FERRE code, taking advantage of the continuum shape to\ndetermine the atmospheric parameters, in particular, the effective temperature.\nSecond, we select interesting targets for follow-up observations, some of them\nwith very low-quality SDSS or LAMOST data. We then obtain and analyze\nhigher-quality medium-resolution spectra obtained with ISIS on the WHT\ntelescope to arrive at a second, more reliable, set of atmospheric parameters.\nThis allows us to derive, with accuracy, the metallicity, and confirm the\nextremely metal-poor nature in most cases. In this second step we also employ\nFERRE, but we take a running mean to normalize both the observed and the\nsynthetic spectra, and therefore the final parameters do not rely on having an\naccurate flux calibration or continuum placement.

In order to understand the origin of\nsuch abundance spreads, we numerically investigate GC formation from massive\nmolecular clouds (MCs) with fractal structures using our new hydrodynamical\nsimulations with star formation and feedback effects of supernovae (SNe) and\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We particularly investigate star formation\nfrom gas chemically contaminated by SNe and AGB stars within MCs with different\ninitial conditions and environments. The principal results are as follows. GCs\nwith multiple generation of stars can be formed from merging of hierarchical\nstar cluster complexes that are developed from high-density regions of fractal\nMCs. Feedback effects of SNe and AGB stars can control the formation\nefficiencies of stars formed from original gas of MCs and from gas ejected from\nAGB stars. The simulated GCs have radial gradients of helium abundances within\nthe central 3 pc. The original MC masses need to be as large as 10^7 Msun for a\ncanonical initial stellar mass function (IMF) so that the final masses of stars\nformed from AGB ejecta can be 10^5 Msun. Since star formation from AGB ejecta\nis rather prolonged (10^8 yr), their formation can be strongly suppressed by\nSNe of the stars themselves. This result implies that the so-called mass budget\nproblem is much more severe than ever thought in the self-enrichment scenario\nof GC formation. and thus that IMF for the second generation of stars should be\n`top-light'. \n\n"}

However we should ask: Do we expect to find\ntransients in these voids given our understanding of the various heating\nsources operating in astrophysical transients? In this work, we explore a broad\nrange of theoretical models and empirical relations to generate optical light\ncurves and to populate the duration-luminosity phase space (DLPS). We explore\ntransients powered by adiabatic expansion, radioactive decay, magnetar\nspin-down, and circumstellar interaction.

We run (dis)concordance tests within each set and across the sets\nusing a recently introduced index of inconsistency (IOI) capable of dissecting\ninconsistencies between two or more data sets.

While many\nsimulations of protostellar disks predict non-steady accretion onto protostars,\ndeeper investigation requires robust observational constraints on the frequency\nand amplitude of variability events characterised across the observable SED.

Collapsing cores in out-of-virial disguise Abstract: We study the dynamical state of cores by using a simple analytical model, a\nsample of observational massive cores, and numerical simulations of collapsing\nmassive cores. From the model, we find that, if cores are formed from turbulent\ncompressions, they evolve from small to large column densities, increasing\ntheir velocity dispersion as they collapse, while they tend to equipartition\nbetween gravity and kinetic energy.\n  From the observational sample, we find that: (a) cores with substantially\ndifferent column densities in the sample do not follow a Larson-like\nlinewidth-size relation. Instead, cores with higher column densities tend to be\nlocated in the upper-left corner of the Larson velocity dispersion-size\ndiagram, a result predicted previously (Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2011a). (b)\nThe data exhibit cores with overvirial values.\n  Finally, in the simulations we reproduce the behavior depicted by the model\nand observational sample: cores evolve towards larger velocity dispersions and\nsmaller sizes as they collapse and increase their column density. However,\ncollapsing cores appear to approach overvirial states within a free-fall time.\nThe cause of this apparent excess of kinetic energy is an underestimation of\nthe gravitational energy, due to the assumption that the gravitational energy\nis given by the energy of an isolated sphere of constant column density. This\nexcess disappears when the gravitational energy is correctly calculated from\nthe actual spatial mass distribution, where inhomogeneities, as well as the\npotential due to the mass outside of the core, also contribute to the\ngravitational energy. We conclude that the observed energy budget of cores in\nsurveys is consistent with their non-thermal motions being driven by their\nself-gravity and in a hierarchical and chaotic collapse. \n\n"}

The small-scale Lorentz force suppresses\nthe convective motions and also the turbulent mixing of entropy between upflows\nand downflows, leading to a large effective Prandtl number ($\\Pr$). We explore\nthis idea in three-dimensional global rotating convection simulations at\ndifferent thermal conductivity ($\\kappa$), i.e., at different $\\Pr$. In\nagreement with previous non-rotating simulations, the convective velocity is\nreduced with the increase of $\\Pr$ as long as the thermal conductive flux is\nnegligible. A subadiabatic layer is formed near the base of the convection zone\ndue to continuous deposition of low entropy plumes in low-$\\kappa$ simulations.\nThe most interesting result of our low-$\\kappa$ simulations is that the\nconvective motions are accompanied by a change in the convection structure that\nis increasingly influenced by small-scale plumes.

The most discrepant of these (in the Milky Way) is the `feeble\ngiant' Crater II. Using analytic arguments supported by controlled numerical\nsimulations of tidally-stripped flattened two-component dwarf galaxies, we\ninvestigate interpretations of Crater II within standard galaxy formation\ntheory. Heavy tidal disruption is necessary to explain the velocity-dispersion\nsuppression which is plausible if the proper motion of Crater II is\n$(\\mu_{\\alpha*},\\mu_\\delta)=(-0.21\\pm0.09,-0.24\\pm0.09)\\mathrm{mas\\,yr}^{-1}$.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the velocity dispersion of tidally-disrupted\nsystems is solely a function of the total mass loss even for weakly-embedded\nand flattened systems. The half-light radius evolution depends more sensitively\non orbital phase and the properties of the dark matter profile. The half-light\nradius of weakly-embedded cusped systems rapidly decreases producing some\ntension with the Crater II observations. This tension is alleviated by cored\ndark matter profiles, in which the half-light radius can grow after tidal\ndisruption. The evolution of flattened galaxies is characterised by two\ncompeting effects: tidal shocking makes the central regions rounder whilst\ntidal distortion produces a prolate tidally-locked outer envelope. After\n$\\sim70$ per cent of the central mass is lost, tidal distortion becomes the\ndominant effect and the shape of the central regions of the galaxy tends to a\nuniversal prolate shape irrespective of the initial shape. \n\n"}

To date, simulation softwares have been\ndeveloped by individual researchers or research groups in each field, with a\nhuge amount of time and effort, even though numerical algorithms used are very\nsimilar. To improve the situation, we have developed a framework, called FDPS,\nwhich enables researchers to easily develop massively parallel particle\nsimulation codes for arbitrary particle methods. Until version 3.0, FDPS have\nprovided API only for C++ programing language. This limitation comes from the\nfact that FDPS is developed using the template feature in C++, which is\nessential to support arbitrary data types of particle. However, there are many\nresearchers who use Fortran to develop their codes. Thus, the previous versions\nof FDPS require such people to invest much time to learn C++. This is\ninefficient. To cope with this problem, we newly developed a Fortran interface\nlayer in FDPS, which provides API for Fortran. In order to support arbitrary\ndata types of particle in Fortran, we design the Fortran interface layer as\nfollows. Based on a given derived data type in Fortran representing particle, a\nPython script provided by us automatically generates a library that manipulates\nthe C++ core part of FDPS. This library is seen as a Fortran module providing\nAPI of FDPS from the Fortran side and uses C programs internally to\ninteroperate Fortran with C++. In this way, we have overcome several technical\nissues when emulating `template' in Fortran. By using the Fortran interface,\nusers can develop all parts of their codes in Fortran.

This scenario therefore contrasts with the simplified classic paradigm\nof a stable disk+jet system, which is the standard model for low-mass star\nformation, and provides an experimental confirmation of a multi-directional and\nunsteady accretion model for massive star formation. \n\n"}

We use the Gaia DR2 catalog to measure the relative\nproper motion of VFTS 16 and nearby bright stars to test if this star might\nhave been ejected from the central cluster, R136, via dynamical ejection. We\nfind that the position angle and magnitude of the relative proper motion (0.338\n+/- 0.046 mas/yr, or approximately 80 +\\- 11 km/s) of VFTS 16 are consistent\nwith ejection from R136 approximately 1.5 +/- 0.2 Myr ago, very soon after the\ncluster was formed. There is some tension with the presumed age of VFTS 16\nthat, from published stellar parameters, cannot be greater than 0.9 +0.3/-0.2\nMyr. Older ages for this star would appear to be prohibited due to the absence\nof He I lines in its optical spectrum, since this sets a firm lower limit on\nits effective temperature. The dynamical constraints may imply an unusual\nevolutionary history for this object, perhaps indicating it is a merger\nproduct. Gaia DR2 also confirms that another very massive star in the Tarantula\nNebula, VFTS 72 (alias BI253; O2 III-V(n)((f*)), is also a runaway on the basis\nof its proper motion as measured by Gaia. While its tangential proper motion\n(0.392 +/-0.062 mas/yr or 93 +/-15 km/s) would be consistent with dynamical\nejection from R136 approximately 1 Myr ago, its position angle is discrepant\nwith this direction at the 2$\\sigma$ level. From their Gaia DR2 proper motions\nwe conclude that the two ~100 solar mass O2 stars, VFTS 16 and VFTS72, are fast\nrunaway stars, with space velocities of around 100 km/s relative to R136 and\nthe local massive star population.

Furthermore,\nstellar rotation can have a significant effect on a star's photometry and\nevolutionary timescale. In this paper we analyze in 12 nearby open clusters,\nranging from ages of 50 Myr to 350 Myr, how broadband UBV color-color relations\ncan be used to identify turnoff stars that are Be stars, blue stragglers,\ncertain types of binaries, or those affected by differential reddening. This\nUBV color-color analysis also directly measures a cluster's E(B-V) and\nestimates its [Fe/H]. The turnoff stars unaffected by these peculiarities\ncreate a narrower and more clearly defined cluster turnoff. Using four common\nisochronal models, two of which consider rotation, we fit cluster parameters\nusing these selected turnoff stars and the main sequence. Comparisons of the\nphotometrically fit cluster distances to those based on Gaia DR2 parallaxes\nfind that they are consistent for all clusters. For older (>100 Myr) clusters,\nlike the Pleiades and the Hyades, comparisons to ages based on the lithium\ndepletion boundary method finds that these cleaned turnoff ages agree to within\n~10% for all four isochronal models. For younger clusters, however, only the\nGeneva models that consider rotation fit turnoff ages consistent with\nlithium-based ages, while the ages based on non-rotating isochrones quickly\ndiverge to become 30% to 80% younger. This illustrates the importance of\nrotation for deriving ages in the youngest (<100 Myr) clusters. \n\n"}

The location of these\n\"missing baryons\" is unclear. By fitting halo profiles to the rotation curves\nof galaxies in the SPARC data set, we measure the \"missing baryon\" mass for\nindividual late-type systems. Assuming that haloes initially accrete the\ncosmological baryon fraction, we show that the maximum energy available from\nsupernovae is typically not enough to completely eject these \"missing baryons\"\nfrom a halo, but it is often sufficient to heat them to the virial temperature.\nThe energy available from supernovae has the same scaling with galaxy mass as\nthe energy needed to heat or eject the \"missing baryons\", indicating that the\ncoupling efficiency of the feedback to the ISM may be constant with galaxy\nvirial mass.

We compute the projected\naccuracies with which the second generation ground-based detectors, such as\nAdvanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), the third\ngeneration detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, as well as\nspace-based detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be able to\nmeasure these multipole parameters. We find that while Advanced LIGO can\nmeasure the first two or three multipole coefficients with good accuracy,\nCosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope may be able to measure the first four\nmultipole coefficients which enter the phasing formula. Intermediate mass ratio\ninspirals, with mass ratio of several tens, in the frequency band of planned\nspace-based LISA mission should be able to measure all the seven multipole\ncoefficients which appear in the 3.5PN phasing formula.

We used archival data from the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) taken between 1995 and 2014, to derive long-baseline\nastrometric time series for stars near the center of the cluster, using\nstate-of-the-art software to extract high-precision astrometry from images. We\nthen modelled these time-series data, and compared microlensing model fits to\nsimple linear proper-motion fits for each selected star. We find no evidence\nfor astrometric microlensing in M 22, in particular for Bulge stars, which are\nmuch more likely to be lensed than cluster stars, due to the geometry of\nmicrolensing events.

Here\nwe extend these 2D simulations to three dimensions (3D) and find that rings and\ngaps are still formed in the presence of a moderately strong ambipolar\ndiffusion. The rings and gaps form from the same basic mechanism that was\nidentified in the 2D simulations, namely, the redistribution of the poloidal\nmagnetic flux relative to the disk material as a result of the reconnection of\na sharply pinched poloidal magnetic field lines. Thus, the less dense gaps are\nmore strongly magnetized with a large poloidal magnetic field compared to the\nless magnetized (dense) rings. The rings and gaps start out rather smoothly in\n3D simulations that have axisymmetric initial conditions. Non-axisymmetric\nvariations arise spontaneously at later times, but they do not grow to such an\nextent as to disrupt the rings and gaps. These disk substructures persist to\nthe end of the simulations, lasting up to 3000 orbital periods at the inner\nedge of the simulated disk. The longevity of the perturbed yet still coherent\nrings make them attractive sites for trapping large grains that would otherwise\nbe lost to rapid radial migration due to gas drag. As the ambipolar diffusivity\ndecreases, both the disk and the wind become increasingly turbulent, driven by\nthe magnetorotational instability, with tightly-wound spiral arms becoming more\nprominent in the disk. \n\n"}

Note that the chiral asymmetry is a good conserved quantity at\nhigh temperature when the Yukawa interaction is weak enough.

In a hadronic model, acceleration of protons and/or nuclei and\ntheir subsequent interactions with gas in the bubble volume can produce the\nobserved gamma rays.

We propose to\nestimate the variations in shape of the CCF by fitting a Skew Normal (SN)\ndensity which, unlike the commonly employed Normal density, includes a skewness\nparameter to capture the asymmetry of the CCF induced by stellar activity and\nthe convective blueshift. The performances of the proposed method are compared\nto the commonly employed Normal density using both simulations and real\nobservations, with different levels of activity and signal-to-noise ratio. When\nconsidering real observations, the correlation between the RV and the asymmetry\nof the CCF and between the RV and the width of the CCF are stronger when using\nthe parameters estimated with the SN density rather than the ones obtained with\nthe commonly employed Normal density. Using the proposed SN approach, the\nuncertainties estimated on the RV defined as the median of the SN are on\naverage 10% smaller than the uncertainties calculated on the mean of the\nNormal. The uncertainties estimated on the asymmetry parameter of the SN are on\naverage 15% smaller than the uncertainties measured on the Bisector Inverse\nSlope Span (BIS SPAN), which is the commonly used parameter to evaluate the\nasymmetry of the CCF.

Based on simple\nsimulations, we were able to demonstrate that this new model improves the\nplanetary detection limits by 12% compared to the model commonly used to\naccount for stellar activity.

When the\ndonor star does not rotate synchronously with respect to the orbit, dynamical\ntidal waves are excited in its envelope. We show that resonance crossings with\nhigh azimuthal-order $(m\\sim3$ to $6$) fundamental modes induce a visible\n\"polygram\" distortion to the star.

The full\nlight curve consists of 26655 individual points obtained between 1901 and 2001.\nThe light curve and its periodicity were analysed with help of the O-C diagram,\nFourier analysis and time-frequency analysis.

For this, a\nsmoothed and noise-filtered signal was created from the averaged data and with\nhelp of time delay embedding, we have tried to reconstruct the attractor of the\nsystem. The main result is that R Cygni shows such period-doubling events that\ncan be interpreted as caused by a repetitive bifurcation of the chaotic\nattractor between a period 2T orbit and chaos. The switch between these two\nstates occurs in a certain compact region of the phase space, where the light\ncurve is characterized by ~1500-days long transients.

In that sense, the photoevaporation for\nsubgalactic systems is not so perfect as argued by one-dimensional spherical\ncalculations.

By treating the accretion shock as a hotspot on the stellar\nsurface we show that Lyman continuum photons are produced at a rate\napproximately three orders of magnitude lower than that produced by a\ncorresponding black body, and that a strong Lyman continuum is only emitted for\nhigh mass accretion rates. When our models are extended to include a column of\nmaterial accreting on to the hotspot we find that the accretion column is\nextremely optically thick to Lyman continuum photons. Further, we find that\nradiative recombination of hydrogen atoms within the column is not an efficient\nmeans of producing photons with energies greater than 13.6eV, and find that an\naccretion column of any conceivable height suppresses the emission of Lyman\ncontinuum photons to a level below or comparable to that expected from the\nstellar photosphere.

In the region where the\nwinds from the two stars collide, a dense slow flow is formed, such that large\ndust grains may be formed.

The\nphase-averaged spectrum of the three musketeers is best described by a three\ncomponent model. This includes two blackbody components, a cooler one, possibly\noriginating from the bulk of the star surface, and a hotter one, coming from a\nsmaller portion of the star surface (a \"hot spot\"), plus a power law. The\nrelative contributions of the three components are seen to vary as a function\nof phase, as the stars' rotation bring into view different emitting regions.\nThe hot spots, which have very different apparent dimensions (in spite of the\nsimilarity of the three neutron stars polar cap radii) are responsible for the\nbulk of the phase variation.

Recently, extensive two\nand three dimensional simulations improved our understanding of the growth and\nsaturation of the instability in colliding plasma shells. However, the\nsteady-state structure of the shock wave transition layers remains poorly\nunderstood. We use basic physical considerations and order-of-magnitude\narguments to study the steady state structure in relativistic unmagnetized\ncollisionless shocks in pair plasmas. The shock contains an electrostatic layer\nresulting from the formation of stationary, magnetically-focused current\nfilaments. The filaments form where the cold upstream plasma and the\ncounterstreaming thermal plasma interpenetrate. The filaments are not entirely\nneutral and strong electrostatic fields are present. Most of the downstream\nparticles cannot cross this layer into the upstream because they are trapped by\nthe electrostatic field. We identify the critical location in the shock\ntransition layer where the electromagnetic field ceases to be static. At this\nlocation, the degree of charge separation in the filaments reaches a maximum\nvalue, the current inside the filaments comes close to the Alfv\\'en limit, and\nthe phase space distribution function starts to isotropize. We argue that the\nradius of the current filaments upstream of the critical location is about\ntwice the upstream plasma skin depth. Finally, we show that some downstream\nparticles cross the electrostatic layer and run ahead of the shock into the\npreshock medium without causing instability. These particles may play an\nimportant role in particle acceleration. \n\n"}

In this paper we apply statistical tests, the chi-square test and the\nF-test, to the Cepheid data from the MACHO project to test for a non-linearity\nof the V- and R-band PL relations at 10 days, and extend these tests to the\nnear infrared (JHK-band) PL relations with 2MASS data. We correct the\nextinction for these data by applying an extinction map towards the LMC. The\nstatistical test we use, the F-test, is able to take account of small numbers\nof data points and the nature of that data on either side of the period cut at\n10 days. With our data, the results we obtained imply that the VRJH-band PL\nrelations are non-linear around a period of 10 days, while the K-band PL\nrelation is (marginally) consistent with a single-line regression. The choice\nof a period of 10 days, around which this non-linearity occurs, is consistent\nwith the results obtained when this \"break\" period is estimated from the data.\nLong period Cepheids are supplemented from the literature to increase our\nsample size. The photometry of these long period Cepheids is compared with our\ndata and no trend with period is found. Our main results remain unchanged when\nwe supplement our dataset with these long period Cepheids. By examining our\ndata at maximum light, we also suggest arguments why errors in reddening are\nunlikely to be responsible for our results. The non-linearity of the mean\nV-band PL relation as seen in both of the OGLE and MACHO data, using different\nextinction maps, suggests that this non-linearity is real. \n\n"}

We\nuse cosmological dark matter simulations of clusters to test the reliability of\nthe method, producing mock catalogues of tangential and radial gravitational\narcs and simulating the radial velocity dispersion profile of the cluster\nbrightest central galaxy. The density profiles of the simulated clusters\nclosely follow the NFW form, but we find that the recovered values of the inner\nslope are systematically underestimated, by about 0.4 in the mean, if the lens\nis assumed to be axially symmetric. However, if the ellipticity and orientation\nof the iso-contours of the cluster lensing potential are taken into account,\nthen the inner slopes can be recovered quite accurately for a significant\nsubset of the clusters whose central surface density profiles appear the most\nregular. These have lensing potentials with ellipticities in the range\n0.15-0.4. Further simulations projecting one cluster along many random\nlines-of-sight show that, even for lower ellipticities, the central slopes are\nunderestimated by $\\sim 10-35%$. These simulations closely mimic past\nobservations (see e.g. Sand et al., 2004), suggesting that existing estimates\nof the central slopes may be biased towards low values. For the remaining\nclusters, where the lensing potential is strongly perturbed by active merging\nor by substructure, the correct determination of the inner slope requires a\nmore accurate model for the lens. When the halo profile is modelled by a\ngeneralised NFW profile, we find that the inferred scale radius and\ncharacteristic density, unlike the inner slope, are generally poorly\nconstrained, since there is a strong degeneracy between these two parameters. \n\n"}

The trend of increasing distance moduli with shorter\nwavelength hints at the existence of significant reddening intrinsic to NGC 55\nwhich affects the measured Cepheid magnitudes. From our data, we determine the\nintrinsic mean reddening of the Cepheids in NGC 55 as E(B-V) = 0.102 mag which\nbrings the distance determinations from the different bands into excellent\nagreement. Our best distance estimate for NGC 55 from the present optical\nCepheid photometry is 26.40 mag $\\pm$ 0.05 mag (internal error) $\\pm$ 0.09 mag\n(systematic error). This value is tied to an assumed LMC distance of 18.50 mag.\nOur quoted systematic error of the present NGC 55 Cepheid distance does not\ntake into account the current uncertainty on the distance of the fiducial LMC\ngalaxy itself.\n  Within the small respective uncertainties, the Sculptor Group galaxies NGC 55\nand NGC 300 are at the same distance of 1.9 Mpc, strengthening the case for a\nphysical association of these galaxies \n\n"}

On the basis of this model, we\npropose an estimator of the linear growth parameter beta = Omega^0.6/b, where b\nmeasures bias, derived from sampling functions which are tuned to eliminate\ndistortions from nonlinear clustering.

In this contribution we present a study of the\nformation and evolution of such DM halos in a COBE-normalized spatially flat\nLCDM model (Omega_0=1-Omega_L=0.3; h=0.7) using high-resolution N-body\nsimulations. The novelty of this study is use of the newly developed\nhalo-finding algorithms to study the evolution of both isolated and satellite\n(located inside virial radii of larger group- and cluster-size systems) halos.\nThe force and mass resolution required for a simulated halo to survive in the\nhigh-density environments typical of groups and clusters is high: ~1-3 kpc and\n\\~10^9 M_sun, respectively.

The HEAO data set also joins\nthe recent results from COMPTEL on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory in the\n1-10 MeV range, which failed to confirm the existence of an \"MeV bump\" in this\nrange. Although the spectrum over the entire range 3 keV < E < 100 GeV can be\nfit by a simple empirical analytic expression, the origin is likely due to a\nnumber of distinct source components.

We have obtained redshifts for three lens systems, SBS 0909+532,\nHST 1411+5211, and CLASS B2319+051. For all of these systems, either the source\nor lens redshift (or both) has been previously unidentified. We find (z_l, z_s)\n= (0.830, 1.377) for SBS 0909+532; (z_l, z_s) = (0.465, 2.811) for HST\n1411+5211, although the source redshift is still tentative; and (z_l1, z_l2) =\n(0.624, 0.588) for the two lensing galaxies in CLASS B2319+051. The background\nradio source in B2319+051 has not been detected optically; its redshift is,\ntherefore, still unknown. We find that the spectral features of the central\nlensing galaxy in all three systems are typical of an early-type galaxy. The\nobserved image splittings in SBS 0909+532 and HST 1411+5211 imply that the\nmasses within the Einstein ring radii of the lensing galaxies are 1.4 x 10^{11}\nand 2.0 x 10^{11} h^{-1} M_sun, respectively. The resulting B band\nmass-to-light ratio for HST 1411+5211 is 41.3 +/- 1.2 h (M/L)_sun, a factor of\n5 times higher than the average early-type lensing galaxy. This large\nmass-to-light is almost certainly the result of the additional mass\ncontribution from the cluster CL 3C295 at z = 0.46.

At later stages,\nwhen there are no winding modes and the background is free to expand, we show\nthat a moving 3-brane, which we identify with our universe, can inflate even\nthough it is radiation-dominated. The crucial ingredients for successful\ninflation are the coupling to the dilaton and the equation of state of the\nbulk. If we suppose the brane initially forms in a collision of\nhigher-dimensional branes, then the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations\nnaturally has a thermal origin. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-ph/0111076", "contents": "Title: Gauged Inflation Abstract: We propose a model for cosmic inflation which is based on an effective\ndescription of strongly interacting, nonsupersymmetric matter within the\nframework of dynamical Abelian projection and centerization. The underlying\ngauge symmetry is assumed to be $SU(N+1)$ with $N \\gg 1$. Appealing to a\nthermodynamical treatment, the ground-state structure of the model is\nclassically determined by a potential for the inflaton field (dynamical\nmonopole condensate) which allows for nontrivially BPS saturated and thereby\nstable solutions. For $T<M_P$ this leads to decoupling of gravity from the\ninflaton dynamics. The ground state dynamics implies a heat capacity for the\nvacuum leading to inflation for temperatures comparable to the mass scale $M$\nof the potential. The dynamics has an attractor property. In contrast to the\nusual slow-roll paradigm we have $m\\gg H$ during inflation. As a consequence,\ndensity perturbations generated from the inflaton are irrelevant for the\nformation of large-scale structure, and the model has to be supplemented with\nan inflaton independent mechanism for the generation of spatial curvature\nperturbations. Within a small fraction of the Hubble time inflation is\nterminated by a transition of the theory to its center symmetric phase. The\nspontaneously broken $Z_{N+1}$ symmetry stabilizes relic vector bosons in the\nepochs following inflation. These heavy relics contribute to the cold dark\nmatter of the universe and potentially originate the UHECRs beyond the GZK\nbound. \n\n"}

We show how future solar\nneutrino experiments with good angular resolution and low energy threshold,\nsuch as Hellaz, can be sensitive to the resulting azimuthal asymmetries in\nevent number, and could therefore provide valuable information on the CP\nproperties and the nature of the neutrinos, provided the solar magnetic field\ndirection is fixed. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0012044", "contents": "Title: Large-scale cosmological perturbations on the brane Abstract: In brane-world cosmologies of Randall-Sundrum type, we show that evolution of\nlarge-scale curvature perturbations may be determined on the brane, without\nsolving the bulk perturbation equations. The influence of the bulk\ngravitational field on the brane is felt through a projected Weyl tensor which\nbehaves effectively like an imperfect radiation fluid with anisotropic stress.\nWe define curvature perturbations on uniform density surfaces for both the\nmatter and Weyl fluids, and show that their evolution on large scales follows\ndirectly from the energy conservation equations for each fluid. The total\ncurvature perturbation is not necessarily constant for adiabatic matter\nperturbations, but can change due to the Weyl entropy perturbation. To relate\nthis curvature perturbation to the longitudinal gauge metric potentials\nrequires knowledge of the Weyl anisotropic stress which is not determined by\nthe equations on the brane. We discuss the implications for large-angle\nanisotropies on the cosmic microwave background sky. \n\n"}

We derive\nthe same (and consistent) result using the curvature perturbation in the\nuniform-field (comoving) gauge and in the zero-shear gauge. Previously, Khoury\net al. interpreted results from the latter gauge condition incorrectly and\nclaimed the scale-invariant spectrum, thus generating controversy in the\nliterature.
