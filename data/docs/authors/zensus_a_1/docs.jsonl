The position\nof the X-ray source was found to agree with the optical position within ~0.4\narcsec. Chandra also surveyed the region before the 2004 event, finding no\nX-ray emission at the location of the progenitor.

The existence of such high redshift events is not surprising, as\nBATSE has enough sensitivity to see them and GRBs are expected out to the\nredshift of the first star formation. To improve results we used five\nluminosity relations with updated calibrations to determine redshifts with\nerror bars. Combining these relations, we calculated the redshifts of 36 BATSE\nGRBs with claimed z>8. Our results include 13 bursts with our derived best\nredshift z_best>8, which looks promising at first. But the calculated redshift\nuncertainties are significantly large in these selected cases. With only one\nexception, all of our bursts have z_1siglow<9.

The key difference between polytropic quark stars and the\npolytropic model studied previously for normal (i.e., non-quarkian) stars is\nrelated to two issues: (i) a constant term representing the contribution of\nvacuum energy may be added in the energy density and the pressure for a quark\nstar, but not for a normal star; (ii) the quark star models with non-vanishing\ndensity at the stellar surface are not avoidable due to the strong interaction\nbetween quarks. The first one implies that the vacuum inside a quark star is\ndifferent from that outside, while the second one is relevant to the effect of\ncolor confinement. The polytropic equations of state are stiffer than that\nderived in conventional realistic models (e.g., the bag model) for quark\nmatter, and pulsar-like stars calculated with a polytropic equation of state\ncould then have high maximum masses (> 2 M_sun).

They are found only in a\nfraction of massive clusters that have complex dynamics, which suggests a\nconnection between these mechanisms and cluster mergers. Here we report a radio\nhalo at low frequencies associated with the merging cluster Abell 521. This\nhalo has an extremely steep radio spectrum, which implies a high frequency\ncut-off; this makes the halo difficult to detect with observations at 1.4 GHz\n(the frequency at which all other known radio haloes have been best studied).\nThe spectrum of the halo is inconsistent with a secondary origin of the\nrelativistic electrons, but instead supports turbulent acceleration, which\nsuggests that many radio haloes in the Universe should emit mainly at low\nfrequencies. \n\n"}

We demonstrate how the area covered by the hotspot at the neutron\nstar surface is decreasing in the course of the outburst together with the\nreflection amplitude. These trends are in agreement with the natural scenario,\nwhere the disc inner edge is receding from the neutron star as the mass\naccretion rate drops. These findings are further supported by the variations of\nthe pulse profiles, which clearly show the presence of the secondary maximum at\nthe late stages of the outburst after October 29. This fact can be interpreted\nas the disc receding sufficiently far from the neutron star to open the view of\nthe lower magnetic pole. In that case, the disc inner radius can be estimated.\nAssuming that disc is truncated at the Alfv\\'en radius, we constrain the\nstellar magnetic moment to \\mu=(9\\pm5) 10^{25} G cm^3, which corresponds to the\nsurface field of 10^8 G.

Our calculations show that the highest mass black holes observed\nin the Galaxy M_bh = 15 Msun in the high metallicity environment (Z=Zsun=0.02)\ncan be explained with stellar models and the wind mass loss rates adopted here.\nTo reach this result we had to set Luminous Blue Variable mass loss rates at\nthe level of about 0.0001 Msun/yr and to employ metallicity dependent\nWolf-Rayet winds. With such winds, calibrated on Galactic black hole mass\nmeasurements, the maximum black hole mass obtained for moderate metallicity\n(Z=0.3 Zsun=0.006) is M_bh,max = 30 Msun.

The model galaxy is employed from an ultra-high-resolution\nchemodynamic simulation of a primordial galaxy by Mori & Umemura (2006),which\nwell reproduces the observed properties of LAEs and LBGs. The total mass of\nmodel galaxy is 10^{11}M_sun. We solve not only photo-ionization but also\ncollisional ionization by shocks. In addition, according to the chemical\nenrichment, we incorporate the effect of dust extinction, taking the size\ndistributions of dust into account. As a result, we find that dust extinction\nreduces the escape fractions by a factor 1.5-8.5 in the LAE phase and by a\nfactor 2.5-11 in the LBG phase, while the collisional ionization by shocks\nincreases the escape fractions by a factor ~ 2. The resultant escape fractions\nare 0.07-0.47 in the LAE phase and 0.06-0.17 in the LBG phase. These results\nare well concordant with the recent estimations derived from the flux ratio at\n1500 angstrom to 900 angstrom of LAEs and LBGs. Combining the resultant escape\nfractions with the luminosity functions of LAEs and LBGs, we find that high-z\nLAEs and LBGs can ionize the IGM at z=3-5.

We show analytically that\nthe dominant source of energy is often potential energy, released as gas in the\nouter disc attempts to circularize at smaller radii.

Normal galaxies with low star-formation rates become radio-faint at high z,\nbecause Inverse Compton (IC) losses off the CMB cool CR electrons and positrons\nrapidly, suppressing their nonthermal radio emission. However, we find that\nthis effect occurs at higher redshifts than previously expected, because\nescape, bremsstrahlung, ionization, and starlight IC losses act to counter this\neffect and preserve the radio luminosity of galaxies. The radio dimming of\nstar-forming galaxies at high z is not just a simple competition between\nmagnetic field energy density and the CMB energy density; the CMB must also\ncompete with every other loss process.

Two magnetic field geometries are considered: parallel or\nperpendicular to the shock. The entropy-vorticity wave, which is simply\nadvected in the unmagnetized limit, separates into five different waves: the\nentropy perturbations are advected, while the vorticity can propagate along the\nfield lines through two Alfven waves and two slow magnetosonic waves.

Modest levels of\nturbulence, ~100 km/s (~10% of the sound speed), suppress the heat-flux-driven\nbuoyancy instability (HBI), resulting in an isotropically tangled magnetic\nfield and a quasi-stable, high entropy, thermal equilibrium with no cooling\ncatastrophe.

Data and Nuclear Activity\n  Classification Abstract: We have conducted a new spectroscopic survey to characterize the nature of\nnuclear activity in Hickson Compact Groups (HCGs) galaxies and establish its\nfrequency. We have obtained new intermediate resolution optical spectroscopy\nfor 200 member-galaxies and corrected for underlying stellar population\ncontamination using galaxy templates. Spectra for 11 additional galaxies have\nbeen acquired from the ESO and 6dF public archives and emission line ratios\nhave been taken from the literature for 59 galaxies more. Here we present the\nresults of our classification of the nuclear activity for 270 member-galaxies,\nwhich belong to a well defined sample of 64 HCGs. We found a large fraction of\ngalaxies, 63%, with emission lines. Using standard diagnostic diagrams, 45% of\nthe emission line galaxies were classified as pure AGNs, 23% as Transition\nObjects (TOs) and 32% as Star Forming Nuclei (SFNs). In the HCGs, the AGN\nactivity appears as the most frequent activity type. Adopting the\ninterpretation that in TOs a Low Luminosity AGN coexists with circumnuclear\nstar formation, the fraction of galaxies with an AGN could rise to 42% of the\nwhole sample. The low frequency (20%) of SFNs confirms that there is no star\nformation enhancement in HCGs. After extinction correction we found a median\nAGN H$\\alpha$ luminosity of 7.1$\\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which implies that\nAGNs in HCG have a characteristically low luminosity. This result added to the\nfact, that there is an almost complete absence of Broad Line AGNs in Compact\nGroups (CGs) as found by Martinez et al.(2008a) and corroborated in this study\nfor HCGs, is consistent with very few gas left in these galaxies.

In order to study the distribution of dark matter in a\ncosmological simulation, the dark matter halos must be identified using a halo\nfinder, which establishes the halo membership of every particle in the\nsimulation. The resources required for halo finding are similar to the\nrequirements for the simulation itself.

In this work, we present the first direct measurement\nof the IGM temperature around a z=6 quasar by analysing the Doppler widths of\nLya absorption lines in the proximity zone of SDSS J0818+1722.

This enables us to place an upper limit on the redshift of HI\nreionisation, z_H, within 33 comoving Mpc of SDSS J0818+1722. If the quasar\nreionises the HeII in its vicinity, then in the limit of instantaneous\nreionisation we infer z_H<9.0 (11.0) at 68 (95) per cent confidence assuming\nphotoheating is the dominant heat source and that HI reionisation is driven by\nionising sources with soft spectra, typical of population II stars. If the HI\nand HeII in the IGM around SDSS J0818+1722 are instead reionised simultaneously\nby a population of massive metal-free stars, characterised by very hard\nionising spectra, we obtain a tighter upper limit of z_H<8.4 (9.4).

For small and medium\ndensities, the phase transition is accurately described in the framework of the\nField Correlation Method, whereas at high density predictions are less certain\nand leave room for the phenomenological models. We study formation of\nmultiquark states (MQS) at zero temperature and high density. Relevant MQS\ncomponents of the nuclear matter can be described using a previously developed\nformalism of the quark compound bags (QCB).\n  Partial-wave analysis of nucleon-nucleon scattering indicates the existence\nof 6QS which manifest themselves as poles of $P$-matrix. In the framework of\nthe QCB model, we formulate a self-consistent system of coupled equations for\nthe nucleon and 6QS propagators in nuclear matter and the G-matrix. The\napproach provides a link between high-density nuclear matter with the MQS\ncomponents and the cumulative effect observed in reactions on the nuclei, which\nrequires the admixture of MQS in the wave functions of nuclei kinematically.\n  6QS determine the natural scale of the density for a possible phase\ntransition into the MQS phase of nuclear matter. Such a phase transition can\nlead to dynamic instability of newly born protoneutron stars and dramatically\naffect the dynamics of supernovae. Numerical simulations show that the phase\ntransition may be a good remedy for the triggering supernova explosions in the\nspherically symmetric supernova models. A specific signature of the phase\ntransition is an additional neutrino peak in the neutrino light curve. For a\nGalactic core-collapse supernova, such a peak could be resolved by the present\nneutrino detectors. The possibility of extracting the parameters of the phase\nof transition from observation of the neutrino signal is discussed also. \n\n"}

These morphological results conform\nwith the results of Hickox et al. 2009 who studied the colors and large-scale\nclustering of AGN, and found a general association of radio-selected AGN with\n``red sequence'' galaxies, mid-IR selected AGN with ``blue cloud'' galaxies,\nand X-ray selected AGN straddling these samples in the ``green valley.''

We test DTD models from the\nliterature, requiring that they simultaneously reproduce the observed cluster\nSN rates and the observed iron-to-stellar mass ratios. A power-law DTD of the\nform t^{-1.2+/-0.3}, extending to a Hubble time, can satisfy both constraints.\nShallower power laws, such as t^{-1/2} cannot, assuming a single DTD, and a\nsingle star-formation burst (either brief or extended) at high z. This implies\n50-85% of SNe Ia explode within 1 Gyr of star formation.

We present our models which include\nboth a self-consistent treatment of the photoionized gas and the stellar\ncontinuum and quantify the impact of such nebular component on the total flux\nof young unresolved star clusters. A comparison with other available models is\nconsidered. The very young star clusters in the SBS 0335-052E dwarf starburst\ngalaxy are used as a test for our models. Due to the low metallicity of the\ngalactic medium our models predict a longer lasted nebular phase which\ncontributes between 10-40% of the total near infrared (NIR) fluxes at around 10\nMyr.

To reduce\ntheir contribution, timing measurements can be made over a range of frequencies\nthat depends on a variety of pulsar and instrumentation-dependent factors that\nwe identify. A salient trend for high signal-to-noise measurements of\nmillisecond pulsars is that time-of-arrival precision is limited either by\nirreducible interstellar scattering or by pulse-phase jitter caused by variable\nemission within pulsar magnetospheres. A cap on timing errors implies that\npulsars must be confined to low dispersion measures (DMs) and observed at high\nfrequencies. Use of wider bandwidths that increase signal-to-noise ratios will\ndegrade timing precision if nondispersive chromatic effects are not mitigated.\nThe allowable region in the DM-frequency plane depends on how chromatic timing\nperturbations are addressed. Without mitigation, observations at 1.4~GHz or\n5~GHz are restricted to $\\DM\\lesssim 30$ and $\\lesssim 100~\\DMu$, respectively.\nWith aggressive mitigation of interstellar scattering and use of large\ntelescopes to provide adequate sensitivity at high frequencies (e.g. Arecibo,\nFAST, phase 1 of the SKA, and the SKA), pulsars with DMs up to 500~$\\DMu$ can\nbe used in precision timing applications.

This technique uses the velocities of particles and thus takes into\naccount the dynamical information. This is in contrast with the majority of\nstandard methods that use the coordinates of particles only. Two quantities are\ncomputed in every mesh cell: the mean and variance of the velocity field. In\nthe cells where the velocity is single-valued the variance must be equal to\nzero exactly, therefore the cells with non-zero variance are identified as\nmulti-stream flows. The technique has been tested in a N-body simulation of the\n\\L CDM model. The preliminary analysis has shown that numerical noise does not\npose a significant problem. The web identified by the new method has been\ncompared with the web identified by the standard technique using only the\nparticle coordinates.

For example, the\nisocontours of the corresponding fields have significantly different shapes and\nsome density peaks of similar heights exhibit significant differences in the\nvelocity variance and vice versa. This suggest that the density and velocity\nvariance have a significant degree of independence. The shape of the\ntwo-dimensional pdf of density and velocity variance confirms this proposition.\nThus, we conclude that the dynamical information probed by this technique\nintroduces an additional dimension into analysis of the web. \n\n"}

In addition, we show that the state of matter\nand the geometrical shape of the celestial object could significantly affect\nthe precessional value.

Because the disc is a fluid and because the gas stream overflows the\ntilted disc and particles can migrate into inner disc annuli, coupled to the\ndisc could be a retrogradely precessing inner ring that is located near the\ninnermost annuli of the disc. However, numerical simulations by Bisikalo et al.\n(2003, 2004) and this work show that an inner spiral density wave can be\ngenerated instead of an inner ring.

In this research note we re-assess the spectral\nresolution of the MILES stellar library and of the stellar population models\nbased on it. This exercise was performed, because of a recent controversy over\nthe exact MILES resolution. We perform our test through the comparison of MILES\nstellar spectra with three different sets of higher-resolution templates, one\nfully theoretical - the MARCS library - and two empirical ones, namely the\nIndo-U.S. and ELODIE v3.1 libraries. The theoretical template has a\nwell-defined very high (R=20000) resolution. Hence errors on this theoretical\nvalue do not affect our conclusions. Our approach based on the MARCS library\nwas crucial to constrain the values of the resolution also for the other two\nempirical templates. We find that the MILES resolution has previously been\nslightly overestimated. We derive a new spectral resolution of 2.54 A FWHM,\ninstead of the nominal 2.3 A. The reason for this difference is due to an\noverestimation of the resolution for the Indo-U.S. library that was previously\nused for estimates of the MILES resolution. For the Indo-U.S. we obtain a new\nvalue of 1.35 A FWHM. Most importantly, the results derived from the MARCS and\nELODIE libraries are in very good agreement.

This paper presents an\noverview of the four SDSS-III surveys. BOSS will measure redshifts of 1.5\nmillion massive galaxies and Lya forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using the\nBAO feature of large scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations of\nthe distance scale and Hubble expansion rate at z<0.7 and at z~2.5.

The feeble nature of these signals requires a strong\nsuppression of backgrounds below a few MeV. Very low intrinsic radiogenic\ncontamination of all detector components needs to be accompanied by the\nefficient identification of muons and of muon-induced backgrounds. Muons\nproduce unstable nuclei by spallation processes along their trajectory through\nthe detector whose decays can mimic the expected signals; for isotopes with\nhalf-lives longer than a few seconds, the dead time induced by a muon-related\nveto becomes unacceptably long, unless its application can be restricted to a\nsub-volume along the muon track. Consequently, not only the identification of\nmuons with very high efficiency but also a precise reconstruction of their\ntracks is of primary importance for the physics program of the experiment. The\nBorexino inner detector is surrounded by an outer water-Cherenkov detector that\nplays a fundamental role in accomplishing this task. The detector design\nprinciples and their implementation are described. The strategies adopted to\nidentify muons are reviewed and their efficiency is evaluated.

The method needs a geometric model of the binary,\naccepts the light curve and the detected pulsation frequencies on input, and on\noutput yields estimates of the pulsation patterns, in form of images -- thus\nallowing a direct identification of the surface mode numbers$(\\ell,m)$.\n  Since it has minimal modelling requirements and can operate on photometric\nobservations in arbitrary wavelength bands, DEM is well suited to analyze the\nwide-band time series collected by space observatories.\n  The method was extensively tested on simulated data, in which almost all\nphotometrically detectable modes with a latitudinal complexity $\\ell-|m|\\le 4$\nwere properly restored. Multimode pulsations can be also reconstructed in a\nnatural manner, as well as pulsations on components with tilted rotation axis\nof known direction. It can also be used in principle to isolate the\ncontribution of hidden modes from the light curve.\n  Sensitivity tests show that moderate errors in the geometric parameters and\nthe assumed limb darkening can be partially tolerated by the inversion, in the\nsense that the lower degree modes are still recoverable. Tidally induced or\nmutually resonant pulsations, however, are an obstacle that neither the eclipse\nmapping, nor any other inversion technique can ever surpass.\n  We conclude that, with reasonable assumptions, Dynamic Eclipse Mapping could\nbe a powerful tool for mode identification, especially in moderately close\neclipsing binary systems, where the pulsating component is not seriously\naffected by tidal interactions so that the pulsations are intrinsic to them,\nand not a consequence of the binarity. \n\n"}

Since millisecond pulsars are stable and accurate emitters, they\nhave been proposed as plausible astrophysical tools to probe the gravitational\neffects of dark matter structures.

We use a large, cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation\nto investigate how this decline is related to the evolution of gas accretion\nand to outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the drop\nin the star formation rate follows a corresponding decline in the global\ncold-mode accretion rate density onto haloes, but with a delay of order the gas\nconsumption time scale in the interstellar medium. Here we define cold-mode\n(hot-mode) accretion as gas that is accreted and whose temperature has never\nexceeded (did exceed) 10^5.5 K. In contrast to cold-mode accretion, which peaks\nat z~3, the hot mode continues to increase to z~1 and remains roughly constant\nthereafter. By the present time, the hot mode strongly dominates the global\naccretion rate onto haloes. Star formation does not track hot-mode halo\naccretion because most of the hot halo gas never accretes onto galaxies. AGN\nfeedback plays a crucial role by preferentially preventing gas that entered\nhaloes in the hot mode from accreting onto their central galaxies.\nConsequently, in the absence of AGN feedback, gas accreted in the hot mode\nwould become the dominant source of fuel for star formation and the drop off in\nthe cosmic star formation rate would be much less steep. \n\n"}

We\nfind that accretion luminosity delays fragmentation within the halos, but does\nnot prevent it.

M87 (NGC\n4486) and Centaurus A (NGC 5128, CenA) are well-studied nearby LLAGNs. As an\nadditional feature they show gamma-radiation up to TeV (10^{12}eV) energies,\nbut the origin of this radiation is not resolved. The coincident observation of\na radio and TeV flare in M87 suggests that the TeV radiation is produced within\naround 50-100 gravitational radii of the central supermassive black hole,\ndepending on the assumed value of the mass of the black hole. Strong radiation\nfields can be produced in the central region of an (LL)AGN, e.g., by the\naccretion flow around the black hole, the jet plasma, or stars closely orbiting\nthe black hole. These radiation fields can lead to the absorption of emitted\nTeV photons, and in fact high optical depths of such fields can make TeV\ndetection from inner regions impossible. In this paper we consider the\naccretion flow around the black hole as the most prominent source for such a\nradiation field and we accordingly calculate the probability for absorption of\nTeV photons produced near the black holes in M87 and CenA assuming a low\nluminosity Shakura-Sunyaev Disk (SSD). We find that the results are very\ndifferent for between the two LLAGNs. While the inner region of M87 is\ntransparent for TeV radiation up to 15TeV, the optical depth in CenA is >> 1,\nleading to an absorption of TeV photons that might be produced near the central\nblack hole. These results imply either that the TeV gamma production sites and\nprocesses are different for both sources, or that LLAGN black holes do not\naccrete (at least only) in form of a low luminosity SSD. \n\n"}

While many have counted\ngalaxy mergers using a variety of techniques, T_obs(z) for these techniques\nhave been poorly constrained. We address this problem by calibrating three\nmerger rate estimators with a suite of hydrodynamic merger simulations and\nthree galaxy formation models. We estimate T_obs(z) for (1) close galaxy pairs\nwith a range of projected separations, (2) the morphology indicator G-M20, and\n(3) the morphology indicator asymmetry A. Then we apply these timescales to the\nobserved merger fractions at z < 1.5 from the recent literature. When our\nphysically-motivated timescales are adopted, the observed galaxy merger rates\nbecome largely consistent. The remaining differences between the galaxy merger\nrates are explained by the differences in the range of mass-ratio measured by\ndifferent techniques and differing parent galaxy selection. The major merger\nrate per unit co-moving volume for samples selected with constant number\ndensity evolves much more strongly with redshift (~ (1+z)^(+3.0 \\pm 1.1)) than\nsamples selected with constant stellar mass or passively evolving luminosity (~\n(1+z)^(+0.1 \\pm 0.4)). We calculate the minor merger rate (1:4 <\nM_{sat}/M_{primary} <~ 1:10) by subtracting the major merger rate from close\npairs from the `total' merger rate determined by G-M20.

We study the stellar population of the dynamically hot stellar halo of\nNGC 3311, the brightest galaxy in the Hydra I cluster, and that of photometric\nsubstructures in the diffuse light to constrain the origin of these components.\n  Methods. We analyze absorption lines in medium-resolution, long-slit spectra\nin the wavelength range 4800-5800 angstrom obtained with FORS2 at the Very\nLarge Telescope. We measure the equivalent width of Lick indices out to 20 kpc\nfrom the center of NGC 3311 and fit them with stellar population models that\naccount for the [alpha/Fe] overabundance.\n  Results. Stars in the dynamically hot halo of NGC 3311 are old (age > 13\nGyr), metal-poor ([Z/H] ~ -0.35), and alpha-enhanced ([alpha/Fe] ~ 0.48).\nTogether with the high velocity dispersion, these measurements indicate that\nthe stars in the halo were accreted from the outskirts of other early-type\ngalaxies, with a possible contribution from dwarf galaxies. We identify a\nregion in the halo of NGC 3311 associated with a photometric substructure where\nthe stellar population is even more metal-poor ([Z/H] ~ -0.73).

The sample spans\na wide range in luminosity (0.02-4 L*) and extends from the cluster core to\nnear the virial radius. We find a clear distinction in the observed trends of\nthe giant and dwarf galaxies. The ages of red-sequence giants are primarily\ndetermined by galaxy mass, with only weak modulation by environment, in the\nsense that galaxies at larger cluster-centric distance are slightly younger.\nFor red-sequence dwarfs (with mass <10^10 Msun), the roles of mass and\nenvironment as predictors of age are reversed: there is little dependence on\nmass, but strong trends with projected cluster-centric radius are observed. The\naverage age of dwarfs at the 2.5 Mpc limit of our sample is approximately half\nthat of dwarfs near the cluster centre. The gradient in dwarf galaxy ages is a\nglobal cluster-centric trend, and is not driven by the ongoing merger of the\nNGC 4839 group to the south west of Coma.

This shell mediates the angular momentum removal\nfrom the rotating neutron star magnetosphere during spin-down episodes by\nlarge-scale convective motions. The accretion rate through the shell is\ndetermined by the ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere. The\nsettling regime of accretion can be realized for moderate accretion rates $\\dot\nM< \\dot M_*\\simeq 4\\times 10^{16}$ g/s. At higher accretion rates a free-fall\ngap above the neutron star magnetosphere appears due to rapid Compton cooling,\nand accretion becomes highly non-stationary. From observations of the\nspin-up/spin-down rates (the angular rotation frequency derivative $\\dot\n\\omega^*$, and $\\partial\\dot\\omega^*/\\partial\\dot M$ near the torque reversal)\nof X-ray pulsars with known orbital periods, it is possible to determine the\nmain dimensionless parameters of the model, as well as to estimate the magnetic\nfield of the neutron star.

We discuss some potential explanations\nfor this discrepancy and conclude that it could be allayed if (1) the power-law\nslope of the IMF for intermediate-mass (1.5 M_sun < m < 5 M_sun) stars were\nsteeper than the Salpeter slope, or (2) a correction factor was applied to the\nextragalactic 24 micron SFR calibrations to account for the duration of star\nformation in individual mid-IR-bright H II regions relative to the lifetimes of\nO stars.

Theory suggests that rotating Wolf-Rayet stars are the best\ncandidates, but their strong stellar winds shroud their surfaces, preventing a\ndirect measurement of their rotation. Fortunately, linear spectropolarimetry\nmay be used to probe the flattening of their winds due to stellar spin.\nSpectropolarimetry surveys show that an 80% majority of WR stars have\nspherically symmetric winds and are thus rotating slowly, yet a small 20%\nminority display a spectropolarimetric signature indicative of rotation. Here\nwe find a highly significant correlation between WR objects that carry the\nsignature of stellar rotation and the subset of WR stars with ejecta nebulae\nthat have only recently transitioned from a red sugergiant or luminous blue\nvariable phase. As these youthful WR stars have yet to spin-down due to mass\nloss, they are the best candidate GRB progenitors identified to date. When we\ntake recently published WR ejecta nebula numbers we find that five out of the\nsix line-effect WR stars are surrounded by ejecta nebulae.

We use Monte Carlo techniques to\nestimate the accuracy of sky localization through networks of ground-based\ninterferometers such as aLIGO and aVirgo. With the addition of the Japanese\nKAGRA detector, it is shown that the detection and triangulation before\ncoalescence may be feasible. \n\n"}

It was first seen with Chandra on 23 December 2010 at L_X ~ 4\n10**39 ergs/s, and has remained ultraluminous through our most recent\nobservations in December 2011, with typical flux variation of a factor of two.\nThe spectrum is well fitted by a combination of absorbed power-law and disk\nblack-body models. While the relative contributions of the models varies with\ntime, we have seen no evidence for a canonical state transition. The luminosity\nand spectral properties are consistent with accretion powered by a black hole\nwith M_BH ~ 40-100 solar masses. In July 2011 we found a luminous, blue optical\ncounterpart which had not been seen in deep HST observations obtained in August\n2009.

This source shows\nthat ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with low-mass companions are an\nimportant component of the ULX population in star-forming galaxies, and\nprovides further evidence that the blue optical counterparts of some ULXs need\nnot indicate a young, high-mass companion, but rather that they may indicate\nX-ray reprocessing. \n\n"}

Short GRBs have $E_{\\rm p}$ tracking\nintensity exclusively with the 16ms time resolution analysis.

The optical\nspectrum exhibits broad emission features of [O I], [O II], [O III], H-alpha,\nH-beta, and [Fe II]. The last decade of evolution has exhibited a strengthening\nof the oxygen transitions, evidence that the late-time emission is powered by\nincreasingly metal-rich SN ejecta crossing the reverse shock. The H-alpha\nluminosity requires that SN 1998S is still interacting with dense circumstellar\nmaterial (CSM), probably produced by the strong wind of a red supergiant\nprogenitor at least ~1000 years before explosion. The emission lines exhibit\nasymmetric blueshifted profiles, which implies that the receding hemisphere of\nthe SN is obscured by dust. The [O III] line, in particular, exhibits a\ncomplete suppression of its red wing. This could be the result of the expected\nwavelength dependence for dust extinction or a smaller radial distribution for\n[O III]. In the latter case, the red wing of [O III] could be absorbed by core\ndust, while both the blue and red wings are absorbed by dust within the cool\ndense shell between the forward and reverse shocks; this interpretation could\nexplain why late-time [O III] emission from SNe is often weaker than models\npredict.

If SLRs are homogenized in the gas of\ngalaxies, the high SSFRs of normal galaxies can partly explain the elevated\nabundance of SLRs like $^{60}$Fe and $^{26}$Al in the early Solar system.\nStarburst galaxies have much higher SSFRs still, and have enormous mean\nabundances of $^{26}$Al ($^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al ~ $10^{-3}$ for Solar metallicity\ngas). The main uncertainty is whether the SLRs are mixed with the star-forming\nmolecular gas: they could be trapped in hot gas and decay before entering the\ncolder phases, or be blown out by starburst winds.

Using galaxy group/cluster catalogs from SDSS DR7, together with a\ncosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star\nformation histories and quenching timescales of satellites of M_star > 5 x 10^9\nM_sun at z=0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing\nand ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly\naccounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z~0.5, or ~5 Gyr\nago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of satellites at their\ntime of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the\nevolution of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we\nconstrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of\nsatellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant\nprocess for building up all quiescent galaxies at M_star < 10^10 M_sun. We then\nconstrain satellite star formation histories, finding a 'delayed-then-rapid'\nquenching scenario: satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall,\nafter which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of < 0.8\nGyr. These quenching timescales are shorter for more massive satellites but do\nnot depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in satellite quiescent\nfraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a\nlower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible\nfor up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. Because of the long\ntime delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellar\nmass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies.

Based on spectra taken at multiple\nepochs of the 1.73d binary orbital period we determine physical as well as\norbital parameters for the donor star.

Based on the X-ray spectrum, the compact companion\nis likely a neutron star, although no pulsations have yet been detected. Using\nthe spectroscopically derived B-star mass we find the neutron star companion\nmass to be M_X = 2.0 \\pm 0.4 M_sun, consistent with the neutron star mass in\nthe HMXB Vela X-1, but heavier than the canonical value of 1.4 M_sun found for\nmany millisecond pulsars. We attempt to use as an additional constraint that\nthe B star radius inferred from temperature, flux, and distance, should equate\nthe Roche radius, since the system accretes by Roche lobe overflow.

Our simulation\nsample focuses on galaxies with present-day stellar masses in the 10^10-10^11\nMsun range, in field and loose group environments, with a broad variety of mass\ngrowth histories. In our models, bars are almost absent from the progenitors of\npresent-day spirals at z>1.5, and they remain rare and generally too weak to be\nobservable down to z~1. After this characteristic epoch, the fractions of\nobservable and strong bars raise rapidly, bars being present in 80% of spiral\ngalaxies and easily observable in two thirds of these at z<0.5. This is\nquantitatively consistent with the redshift evolution of the observed bar\nfraction. Our models predict that the decrease in the bar fraction with\nincreasing redshift should continue with a fraction of observable bars <10-15%\nin disk galaxies at z>1. Our models also predict later bar formation in\nlower-mass galaxies, in agreement with existing data. We find that the\ncharacteristic epoch of bar formation, namely redshift z~0.8-1, corresponds to\nthe epoch at which today's spirals acquire their disk-dominated morphology. At\nhigher redshift, disks tend to be rapidly destroyed by mergers and\ngravitational instabilities and rarely develop significant bars.

One mechanism to reconcile the simulations with\nthe observed data is the feedback from star formation, this might be successful\nin isolated dwarf galaxies but its success in LSB galaxies remains unclear.\nAdditionally, including too much feedback in the simulations is a double-edged\nsword, in order to obtain a cored DM distribution from an initially cuspy one,\nthe feedback recipes usually require to remove a large quantity of baryons from\nthe center of galaxies, however, some feedback recipes produce twice more\nsatellite galaxies of a given luminosity and with much smaller mass to light\nratios from those that are observed.

Here we present the\nspatial distribution of Halpha emission for a sample of 54 strongly\nstar-forming galaxies at z~1 in the 3D-HST Treasury survey.

We verify that our method reproduces published results for\ncollisional equilibrium, collisional non-equilibrium, and photo-ionised\nequilibrium. Non-equilibrium effects can become very important in cooling gas,\nparticularly below 10^6 K. Photo-ionisation and non-equilibrium effects both\ntend to boost the degree of ionisation and to reduce cooling efficiencies. The\neffect of the EGB is larger for lower densities.

The main contribution comes from z<2, where dark energy\nleads to a decay of potentials. As the same photons are gravitationally lensed\nby these decaying potentials, there exists a high degree of correlation between\nthe ISW effect and CMB lensing, leading to a non-zero three-point correlation\n(bispectrum) of the observed temperature anisotropy. This ISW-lensing\nbispectrum, whose shape resembles that of the so-called \"local-form\" primordial\nbispectrum parametrized by fNL, is known to be the largest contamination of\nfNL. In order to avoid a spurious detection of primordial non-Gaussianity, we\nneed to remove the ISW-lensing bias. In this work, we investigate three\ndebiasing methods: (I) subtraction of an expected, ensemble average of the\nISW-lensing bispectrum; (II) subtraction of a measured ISW-lensing bispectrum;\nand (III) direct subtraction of an estimated ISW signal from an observed\ntemperature map. One may use an estimation of the ISW map from external non-CMB\ndata or that from the CMB data themselves. As the methods II and III are based\non fewer assumptions about the nature of dark energy, they are preferred over\nthe method I. While the methods I and II yield unbiased estimates of fNL with\ncomparable error bars, the method III yields a biased result when the\nunderlying primordial fNL is non-zero and the ISW map is estimated from a\nlensing potential reconstructed from the observed temperature map. One of the\nsources of the bias is a lensing reconstruction noise bias which is independent\nof fNL and can be calculated precisely, but other fNL-dependent terms are\ndifficult to compute reliably. We thus conclude that the method II is the best,\nmodel-independent way to remove the ISW-lensing bias of fNL, enabling us to\ntest the physics of inflation with smaller systematic errors. \n\n"}

We suggest that the quasi-periodicity feature of\ntiming noise, with rapid oscillations lying on lower frequency structure, comes\nfrom the geodetic precession of an unseen binary system, which induces\nadditional motion of the pulsar spin axis. The resultant change of azimuth and\nlatitude at which the observer's line of sight crosses the emission beam is\nresponsible for the variation of timing noise and pulse profile respectively.\nThe first numerical simulation to both timing noise and pulse profile variation\nare thus performed, from which the orbital periods of these pulsars are of 1-35\nminutes.

Such a combination of signals could be generated by dark\nmatter annihilations in the main dark matter halo, its substructures and nearby\ngalaxy clusters. We discuss in this work the consistency between the number of\nevents observed at the line energies in the sky and the predictions using\nresults from the Via Lactea II numerical simulation and extrapolations below\nits mass resolution, taking into account that the annihilation cross-section to\nthe lines can be estimated from the Galactic center signal. We find that some\nextrapolations to small substructures can naturally account for the point\nsources signal, although the hypothesis of background only cannot be rejected.\nWe also study the morphology of the gamma-ray sky at the 2 lines energies,\ntesting different Galactic diffuse background models to account for\ninterstellar medium uncertainties, and different assumptions on the DM diffuse\ncomponent profile. We find from template fits that within reasonable diffuse\nbackground uncertainties the presence of a spherical halo component is\npreferred with cuspier dark matter halo profiles being preferable even from the\nfull sky fit. We finally check the impact of a dark disk component, suggested\nby cosmological simulations that include baryons and find that thin dark disks\ncan not be disfavored, thus possibly accounting for the preferentially closer\nto the Galactic disk distribution of the point sources lines signal. \n\n"}

A rare subclass of SNe Ia\nshow evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (CSM), and\nin particular, a hydrogen-rich CSM; we refer to them as SNe Ia-CSM. In the\nfirst systematic search for such systems, we have identified 16 SNe Ia-CSM, and\nhere we present new spectra of 13 of them. Six SNe Ia-CSM have been\nwell-studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in-depth\nfor the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the Palomar\nTransient Factory. The spectra of all SNe Ia-CSM are dominated by H{\\alpha}\nemission (with widths of ~2000 km/s) and exhibit large H{\\alpha}/H{\\beta}\nintensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the SN\nejecta overtaking slower-moving CSM shells); moreover, they have an almost\ncomplete lack of He I emission. They also show possible evidence of dust\nformation through a decrease in the red wing of H{\\alpha} 75-100 d past maximum\nbrightness, and nearly all SNe Ia-CSM exhibit strong Na I D absorption from the\nhost galaxy. The absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction)\nof SNe Ia-CSM are found to be -21.3 <= M_R <= -19 mag, and they also seem to\nshow ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at late\ntimes (but no detected radio or X-ray emission). Finally, the host galaxies of\nSNe Ia-CSM are all late-type spirals similar to the Milky Way, or dwarf\nirregulars like the Large Magellanic Cloud, which implies that these objects\ncome from a relatively young stellar population.

We also employ a simplified radiative-transfer\nalgorithm that allows the stellar particles to feed back on the medium at a\nrate that depends on their mass and the local density. Our results are as\nfollows: a) Contrary to the results from our previous study, where all stellar\nparticles injected energy at a rate corresponding to a star of ~ 10 Msun, the\ndense gas is now completely evacuated from 10-pc regions around the stars\nwithin 10-20 Myr, suggesting that this feat is accomplished essentially by the\nmost massive stars. b) At the scale of the whole numerical simulations, the\ndense gas mass is reduced by up to an order of magnitude, although star\nformation (SF) never shuts off completely, indicating that the feedback\nterminates SF locally, but new SF events continue to occur elesewhere in the\nclouds. c) The SF efficiency (SFE) is maintained globally at the ~ 10% level,\nalthough locally, the cloud with largest degree of focusing of its accretion\nflow reaches SFE ~ 30%. d) The virial parameter of the clouds approaches unity\nbefore the stellar feedback begins to dominate the dynamics, becoming much\nlarger once feedback dominates, suggesting that clouds become unbound as a\nconsequence of the stellar feedback. e) The erosion of the filaments that feed\nthe star-forming clumps produces chains of isolated dense blobs reminiscent of\nthose observed in the vicinity of the dark globule B68. \n\n"}

ALPT is based on a\ncombination of second order LPT (2LPT) on large scales and the spherical\ncollapse model on smaller scales. We account for the systematic deviation of\nperturbative approaches from N-body simulations together with halo biasing\nadopting an exponential bias model. We then account for stochastic biasing by\ndefining three regimes: a low, an intermediate and a high density regime, using\na Poisson distribution in the intermediate regime and the negative binomial\ndistribution to model over-dispersion in the high density regime. Since we\nfocus in this study on massive halos, we suppress the generation of halos in\nthe low density regime.

Cold accretion flows, which consist of cool optically thick gas, are found\nat relatively high mass accretion rates. Prominent examples are the standard\nthin disk, which occurs at a fraction of the Eddington mass accretion rate, and\nthe slim disk at super-Eddington rates. These accretion flows are responsible\nfor luminous systems such as active galactic nuclei radiating at or close to\nthe Eddington luminosity and black hole X-ray binaries in the soft state. Hot\naccretion flows, the topic of this review, are virially hot and optically thin.\nThey occur at lower mass accretion rates, and are described by models such as\nthe advection-dominated accretion flow and luminous hot accretion flow. Because\nof energy advection, the radiative efficiency of these flows is in general\nlower than that of a standard thin accretion disk. Moreover, the efficiency\ndecreases with decreasing mass accretion rate. Observations show that hot\naccretion flows are associated with jets. In addition, theoretical arguments\nsuggest that hot flows should produce strong winds.

EXors, a loosely\ndefined class of pre-main sequence stars, exhibit shorter and repetitive\noutbursts, associated with lower accretion rates. The relationship between the\ntwo classes, and their connection to the standard pre-main sequence\nevolutionary sequence, is an open question: do they represent two distinct\nclasses, are they triggered by the same physical mechanism, and do they occur\nin the same evolutionary phases?

We find it to be crucial in all intermediate-mass models\ninvestigated ([Fe/H] < -2 and 2.5 < M/Msun < 5), because of the evolution of\nthe surface chemistry, including the orders of magnitude increase in the\nabundance of molecule-forming species. Its effect on these models mirrors that\npreviously reported for higher-metallicity models - increase in radius,\ndecrease in Teff, faster mass loss, shorter thermally pulsing AGB lifetime,\nreduced enrichment in third dredge-up products (by a factor of three to ten),\nand an increase in the mass limit for hot bottom burning.

We also find a decrease in concentration of ~0.07 (1.9 <\n$C_{3000}$ < 3.9). The lack of a strong relationship between $r_{50}$ and\nwavelength is consistent with a model in which clumpy star formation is\ndistributed over length scales comparable to the galaxy's rest-frame optical\nlight. While the wavelength dependence of $r_{50}$ is independent of size at\nall redshifts, concentration decreases more sharply in the far-UV (~1500 \\AA)\nfor large galaxies at z ~ 1. This decrease in concentration is caused by a\nflattening of the inner ~20% of the light profile in disk-like galaxies,\nindicating that the central regions have different UV colors than the rest of\nthe galaxy.

The most\ninteresting one is the so-called rho-state, whose light curve shows recurrent\nbursts. This paper presents a model based on Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations\ncontaining two variables: x, linked to the source photon luminosity L detected\nby the MECS, and y related to the mean photon energy. We aim at providing a\nsimple mathematical framework composed by non-linear differential equations\nuseful to predict the observed light curve and the energy lags for the\nrho-state and possibly other classes of the source. We studied the equilibrium\nstate and the stability conditions of this system that includes one external\nparameter, J, that can be considered a function of the disk accretion rate. Our\nwork is based on observations performed with the MECS on board BeppoSAX when\nthe source was in rho and nu mode, respectively. The evolution of the mean\ncount rate and photon energy were derived from a study of the trajectories in\nthe count rate - photon energy plane. Assuming J constant, we found a solution\nthat reproduces the x profile of the rho class bursts and, unexpectedly, we\nfound that y exhibited a time modulation similar to that of the mean energy.\nMoreover, assuming a slowly modulated J the solutions for x quite similar to\nthose observed in the nu class light curves is reproduced. According these\nresults, the outer mass accretion rate is probably responsible for the state\ntransitions, but within the rho-class it is constant. This finding makes\nstronger the heuristic meaning of the non-linear model and suggests a simple\nrelation between the variable x and y.

Secular interactions transfer\nangular momentum between inner and outer orbits unless their apsidal lines are\nparallel or anti-parallel. These choices correspond, respectively, to\northogonal eigenmodes p and a. Each is characterized by an eccentricity ratio\nset by the masses and semi-major axes, i.e., $e_{p, 1}/e_{p, 2}\\sim a_1/a_2$\nwhile $e_{a, 1}/e_{a, 2}\\sim (a_1/a_2)^{-3/2}(m_2/m_1)$. Mode p dominates the\nsystem's current state so $e_1/e_2$ always remains close to $e_{p, 1}/e_{p,\n2}$. A small contribution by Mode a causes $e_1$ and $e_2$ to oscillate with\nperiod $\\sim 10^3\\,\\yr$. Orbital changes should be apparent in a few years.\nThese will reveal the forcing of the apsidal precession of the inner orbit by\ngeneral relativity (GR), and possibly also the smaller contribution due to the\ntidal and rotational distortion of the inner white dwarf (WD). Phinney (1992)\nproposes that the epicyclic energy of a WD-pulsar binary reaches equipartition\nwith the kinetic energy of a single convective eddy when the WD's progenitor\nfills its Roche lobe. We extend Phinney's theory to apply to modes rather than\nindividual orbits. Thus we predict that Mode p and Mode a achieved\nequipartition with eddies in the giant envelopes of the progenitors of the\nouter and inner WD, respectively. The most effective eddies are those with\nlifetimes closest to the orbit period. These were more energetic in the\nprogenitor of the outer WD. This explains why Mode p overwhelms Mode a, and\nalso why the inner binary's orbit is far more eccentric than other WD-pulsar\nbinaries with similar orbit periods.

This\nproblem has drawn renewed interest due to recent determinations of gas mass\nfractions beyond R200, which appear to be considerably larger than the cosmic\nmean, and because the clusters' total Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux receives a\nsignificant contribution from these regions.

We find\nthat density and pressure clumping closely trace each other as a function of\nradius, but the bias on density remains on average < 20% within the virial\nradius R200. At larger radius, clumping increases steeply due to the continuous\ninfall of coherent structures that have not yet passed the accretion shock.\nDensity and pressure clumping increase with cluster mass and redshift, which\nprobes on average dynamically younger objects that are still in the process of\nassembling.

The galaxy is enriched with r-process\nelements by binary neutron star (NS) mergers and with iron and other metals by\nsupernovae. These calculations include key hydrodynamic mixing processes not\npresent in standard semi-analytic chemical evolution models, such as galactic\nwinds and hydrodynamic flows associated with structure formation. We explore a\nrange of models for the rate and delay time of NS mergers, intended to roughly\nbracket the wide range of models consistent with current observational\nconstraints. We show that NS mergers can produce [r-process/Fe] abundance\nratios and scatter that appear reasonably consistent with observational\nconstraints. At low metallicity, [Fe/H]<-2, we predict there is a wide range of\nstellar r-process abundance ratios, with both supersolar and subsolar\nabundances. Low-metallicity stars or stars that are outliers in their r-process\nabundance ratios are, on average, formed at high redshift and located at large\ngalactocentric radius. Because NS mergers are rare, our results are not fully\nconverged with respect to resolution, particularly at low metallicity. However,\nthe uncertain rate and delay time distribution of NS mergers introduces an\nuncertainty in the r-process abundances comparable to that due to finite\nnumerical resolution. Overall, our results are consistent with NS mergers being\nthe source of most of the r-process nuclei in the Universe. \n\n"}

Physically meaningful cosmic accretion of both\ndark matter and baryons occurs at z > 1 across our halo mass range: M_200m =\n10^{11-14} M_sun.

Determination of the fundamental interactions that\ngovern matter under such extreme conditions is one of the major unsolved\nproblems of modern physics, and -- since it is impossible to replicate these\nconditions on Earth -- a major scientific motivation for SKA.

The progenitor is a nonrotating,\nzero-metallicity 9.6 Msun star with an iron core. While in spherical symmetry\noutward shock acceleration sets in later than 300 ms after bounce, a successful\nexplosion starts at ~130 ms postbounce in two dimensions (2D). The 3D model\nexplodes at about the same time but with faster shock expansion than in 2D and\na more quickly increasing and roughly 10 percent higher explosion energy of\n>10^50 erg. The more favorable explosion conditions in 3D are explained by\nlower temperatures and thus reduced neutrino emission in the cooling layer\nbelow the gain radius. This moves the gain radius inward and leads to a bigger\nmass in the gain layer, whose larger recombination energy boosts the explosion\nenergy in 3D. These differences are caused by less coherent, less massive, and\nless rapid convective downdrafts associated with postshock convection in 3D.\nThe less violent impact of these accretion downflows in the cooling layer\nproduces less shock heating and therefore diminishes energy losses by neutrino\nemission. We thus have, for the first time, identified a reduced mass accretion\nrate, lower infall velocities, and a smaller surface filling factor of\nconvective downdrafts as consequences of 3D postshock turbulence that\nfacilitate neutrino-driven explosions and strengthen them compared to the 2D\ncase. \n\n"}

Although dark matter constitutes only\n$\\lesssim 0.1\\%$ of the stellar mass, this amount is sufficient to power the\nstar for millions to billions of years. Thus, the first phase of stellar\nevolution in the history of the Universe may have been dark stars. We review\nhow dark stars come into existence, how they grow as long as dark matter fuel\npersists, and their stellar structure and evolution. The studies were done in\ntwo different ways, first assuming polytropic interiors and more recently using\nthe MESA stellar evolution code; the basic results are the same. Dark stars are\ngiant, puffy ($\\sim$ 10 AU) and cool (surface temperatures $\\sim$10,000 K)\nobjects.

The exact nature of their progenitor systems however remain unclear.\nRadio emission from the interaction between the explosion shock front and its\nsurrounding CSM or ISM provides an important probe into the progenitor star's\nlast evolutionary stage. No radio emission has yet been detected from Type Ia\nsupernovae by current telescopes. The SKA will hopefully detect radio emission\nfrom Type Ia supernovae due to its much better sensitivity and resolution.\nThere is a 'supernovae rate problem' for the core collapse supernovae because\nthe optically dim ones are missed due to being intrinsically faint and/or due\nto dust obscuration. A number of dust-enshrouded optically hidden supernovae\nshould be discovered via SKA1-MID/survey, especially for those located in the\ninnermost regions of their host galaxies.

Here, we discuss the instrumental polarization of LOFAR and present\nrealistic simulations of the leakages between Stokes parameters. From the LOFAR\nobservations of polarized emission in the 3C196 field, we have quantified the\nlevel of polarization leakage caused by the nominal model beam of LOFAR, and\ncompared it with the EoR signal using power spectrum analysis. We found that at\n134--166 MHz, within the central 4$^\\circ$ of the field the $(Q,U)\\rightarrow\nI$ leakage power is lower than the EoR signal at $k<0.3$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The\nleakage was found to be localized around a Faraday depth of 0, and the rms of\nthe leakage as a fraction of the rms of the polarized emission was shown to\nvary between 0.2-0.3\\%, both of which could be utilized in the removal of\nleakage.

This is mainly for two reasons. One relies on the gravitational\npotential of a moving lens being time-dependent (the $\\text{Moving}$\n$\\text{Cluster}$ $\\text{Effect}$, $\\text{MCE}$). The other is due to uneven\nmagnification across the extended, rotating source (the $\\text{Differential}$\n$\\text{Magnification}$ $\\text{Effect}$, $\\text{DME}$). The time delay between\nthe images can also cause their redshifts to differ because of cosmological\nexpansion. This Differential Expansion Effect is likely to be small.

This velocity can\nbe estimated with complicated hydrodynamic models. Uncertainties with such\nmodels can be avoided using the MCE.

It\nconsists of compact sources, both Galactic and extragalactic, detected over the\nentire sky. Compact sources detected in the lower frequency channels are\nassigned to the PCCS2, while at higher frequencies they are assigned to one of\ntwo sub-catalogues, the PCCS2 or PCCS2E, depending on their location on the\nsky. The first of these catalogues covers most of the sky and allows the user\nto produce subsamples at higher reliabilities than the target 80% integral\nreliability of the catalogue. The PCCS2E contains sources detected in sky\nregions where the diffuse emission makes it difficult to quantify the\nreliability of the detections.

Studies of nearby starbursts have shown that Lyman continuum\nand line emission are absorbed by dust and that the Lyman-alpha is resonantly\nscattered by neutral hydrogen. A source of feedback is required to prevent\nscattering and allow the Lyman-alpha emission to escape. There are two X-ray\npoint sources embedded in the Lyman Break Analog (LBA) galaxy Haro 11. Haro 11\nX-1 is an extremely luminous (L$_{X} \\sim 10^{41}$ ergs s$^{-1}$), spatially\ncompact source with a hard X-ray spectrum. Haro 11 X-1 is similar to the\nextreme Black Hole Binary (BHB) M82 X-1. The hard X-ray spectrum indicates Haro\n11 X-1 may be a Black Hole Binary (BHB) in a low accretion state.

In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is\ninitiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition\nfor spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$.

Such\nsimulations resemble observations of filaments and fibres in nearby molecular\nclouds. The sub-filaments are dynamical features formed at the stagnation\npoints of the turbulent velocity field where shocks dissipate the turbulent\nenergy. They are a ubiquitous feature of the simulated clouds, which appear\nfrom the beginning of the simulation and are not formed by gradual\nfragmentation of larger filaments. Most of the sub-filaments are\ngravitationally sub-critical and do not fragment into cores, however, there is\nalso a significant fraction of supercritical sub-filaments which break up into\nstar-forming cores. The sub-filaments are coherent along their length, and the\nresidual velocities along their spine show that they are subsonically\ncontracting without any ordered rotation on scales of ~0.1 pc.

Halo mass is the main\n  driver of galaxy quenching Abstract: We develop a simple yet comprehensive method to distinguish the underlying\ndrivers of galaxy quenching, using the clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing of\nred and blue galaxies in SDSS. Building on the iHOD framework developed by Zu &\nMandelbaum (2015a), we consider two quenching scenarios: 1) a \"halo\" quenching\nmodel in which halo mass is the sole driver for turning off star formation in\nboth centrals and satellites; and 2) a \"hybrid\" quenching model in which the\nquenched fraction of galaxies depends on their stellar mass while the satellite\nquenching has an extra dependence on halo mass. The two best-fit models\ndescribe the red galaxy clustering and lensing equally well, but halo quenching\nprovides significantly better fits to the blue galaxies above $10^{11}\nM_\\odot/h^2$. The halo quenching model also correctly predicts the average halo\nmass of the red and blue centrals, showing excellent agreement with the direct\nweak lensing measurements of locally brightest galaxies. Models in which\nquenching is not tied to halo mass, including an age-matching model in which\ngalaxy colour depends on halo age at fixed $M_*$, fail to reproduce the\nobserved halo mass for massive blue centrals. We find similar critical halo\nmasses responsible for the quenching of centrals and satellites\n(~$1.5\\times10^{12} M\\odot/h^2$), hinting at a uniform quenching mechanism for\nboth, e.g., the virial shock-heating of infalling gas. The success of the iHOD\nhalo quenching model provides strong evidence that the physical mechanism that\nquenches star formation in galaxies is tied principally to the masses of their\ndark matter halos rather than the properties of their stellar components. \n\n"}

Robust detections of Zeeman\nsignatures at all observed epochs indicate a surface magnetic field, with\nlongitudinal magnetic field strengths varying between 1.0-3.2 G. Radial\nvelocity variations from night to night modulate on a similar timescale to the\nlongitudinal magnetic field measurements.

Both the longitudinal\nmagnetic field measurements and radial velocity variations are consistent with\na rotation period of 10 +/- 2 days, which are also consistent with the measured\nchromospheric activity level of the star (log R'(HK)=-4.64).

We\nuse a simple analytical model to localize the maser disk and understand its\nconnection with the torus by combining NuSTAR spectral parameters with\navailable physical quantities from VLBI mapping.\n  Results. Most of the sources analyzed are heavily obscured, showing a column\ndensity in excess of $\\sim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. In particular, $79\\%$ are\nCompton-thick ($N_{\\rm H} > 1.5 \\times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$). Using column\ndensities measured by NuSTAR, with the assumption that the torus is the\nextension of the maser disk, and further assuming a reasonable density profile,\nthe torus dimensions can be predicted. They are found to be consistent with\nmid-IR interferometry parsec-scale observations of Circinus and NGC 1068. In\nthis picture, the maser disk is intimately connected to the inner part of the\ntorus. It is probably made of a large number of molecular clouds connecting the\ntorus and the outer part of the accretion disk, giving rise to a thin disk\nrotating in most cases in Keplerian or sub-Keplerian motion. This toy model\nexplains the established close connection between water megamaser emission and\nnuclear obscuration as a geometric effect. \n\n"}

We compared\nour results with the stellar abundances observed in the Milky Way for O, Na,\nMg, Si, Ca, Ti, and Mn. Our results suggest that the range of metallicity\nconsidered is more important than the number of metallicities within that\nrange, which only affects our numerical predictions by about 0.1 dex. We found\nthat our predictions at [Fe/H] < -2 are very sensitive to the metallicity range\nand the mass sampling used for the lowest metallicity included in the set of\nyields. Variations between results can be as high as 0.8 dex, for any remnant\nmass prescription.

But with a remnant mass prescription that includes islands of\nnon-explodability, the mass resolution can cause variations of about 0.2 to 0.7\ndex depending on the choice of metallicity range. With such a prescription,\nexplosive or non-explosive models can be missed if not enough masses are\nselected, resulting in over- or under-estimations of the mass ejected by\nmassive stars. \n\n"}

The main purpose of the code is to prepare\nand analyze multi-wavelength continuum polarization measurements in the context\nof magnetic field studies in the interstellar medium.

In this work, we gain insights into the\nrelative importance of different heating mechanisms using three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations including cold gas accretion and momentum-driven jet\nfeedback, which are the most successful models to date in terms reproducing the\nproperties of cool cores. We find that there is net heating within two `jet\ncones' (within ~30 degrees from the axis of jet precession) where the ICM gains\nentropy by shock heating and mixing with the hot thermal gas within bubbles.\nOutside the jet cones, the ambient gas is heated by weak shocks, but not enough\nto overcome radiative cooling, therefore forming a `reduced' cooling flow.\nConsequently, the cluster core is in a process of `gentle circulation' over\nbillions of years. Within the jet cones, there is significant adiabatic cooling\nas the gas is uplifted by buoyantly rising bubbles; outside the cones, energy\nis supplied by inflow of already-heated gas from the jet cones as well as\nadiabatic compression as the gas moves toward the center. In other words, the\nfluid dynamics self-adjusts such that it compensates and transports the heat\nprovided by the AGN, and hence no fine-tuning of the heating profile of any\nprocess is necessary.

However, its detection requires a thorough\nunderstanding and control of the systematic errors. We study two systematic\nbiases observed in the LOFAR EoR residual data after calibration and\nsubtraction of bright discrete foreground sources. The first effect is a\nsuppression in the diffuse foregrounds, which could potentially mean a\nsuppression of the 21 cm signal. The second effect is an excess of noise beyond\nthe thermal noise. The excess noise shows fluctuations on small frequency\nscales, and hence it can not be easily removed by foreground removal or\navoidance methods. Our analysis suggests that sidelobes of residual sources due\nto the chromatic point spread function and ionospheric scintillation can not be\nthe dominant causes of the excess noise.

Galaxies were therein\nseparated from stars and quasars through colour cuts, which may leave\nimperfections because of mixing different source types which overlap in colour\nspace. The aim of the present work is to identify galaxies in the\nWISExSuperCOSMOS catalogue through an alternative approach of machine learning.\nThis allows us to define more complex separations in the multi-colour space\nthan possible with simple colour cuts, and should provide more reliable source\nclassification. For the automatised classification we use the support vector\nmachines learning algorithm, employing SDSS spectroscopic sources cross-matched\nwith WISExSuperCOSMOS as the training and verification set. We perform a number\nof tests to examine the behaviour of the classifier (completeness, purity and\naccuracy) as a function of source apparent magnitude and Galactic latitude. We\nthen apply the classifier to the full-sky data and analyse the resulting\ncatalogue of candidate galaxies. We also compare thus produced dataset with the\none presented in B16. The tests indicate very high accuracy, completeness and\npurity (>95%) of the classifier at the bright end, deteriorating for the\nfaintest sources, but still retaining acceptable levels of 85%. No significant\nvariation of classification quality with Galactic latitude is observed.\nApplication of the classifier to all-sky WISExSuperCOSMOS data gives 15 million\ngalaxies after masking problematic areas. The resulting sample is purer than\nthe one in B16, at a price of lower completeness over the sky. The automatic\nclassification gives a successful alternative approach to defining a reliable\ngalaxy sample as compared to colour cuts. \n\n"}

Filtering is frequently used to\nminimize the impact of low frequency noise, atmospheric contributions and/or\nscan synchronous signals on the resulting maps. In this work we explicitly\nconstruct a general filtering operator, which can unambiguously remove any set\nof unwanted modes in the data, and then amend the map-making procedure in order\nto incorporate and correct for it. We show that such an approach is\nmathematically equivalent to the solution of a problem in which the sky signal\nand unwanted modes are estimated simultaneously and the latter are marginalized\nover. We investigate the conditions under which this amended map-making\nprocedure can render an unbiased estimate of the sky signal in realistic\ncircumstances. We then study the effects of time-domain filtering on the noise\ncorrelation structure in the map domain, as well as impact it may have on the\nperformance of the popular pseudo-spectrum estimators. We conclude that\nalthough maps produced by the proposed estimators arguably provide the most\nfaithful representation of the sky possible given the data, they may not\nstraightforwardly lead to the best constraints on the power spectra of the\nunderlying sky signal and special care may need to be taken to ensure this is\nthe case.

Core creation is\nregarded as one of the most promising solutions to potential issues faced by\nthe lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmology on small scales. For example,\nthe reduced dynamical mass enclosed by cores can explain the low rotational\nvelocities measured for nearby dwarf galaxies, thus possibly lifting the\nseeming contradiction with the LambdaCDM expectations (the so-called \"too big\nto fail\" problem). Here we test core creation as a solution of cosmological\nissues by using a sample of dwarfs with measurements of their atomic hydrogen\n(HI) kinematics extending to large radii. Using the NIHAO hydrodynamical\nsimulation as an example, we show that core creation can successfully reproduce\nthe kinematics of dwarfs with small kinematic radii, R <~ 1.5 kpc.

In one\npopular scenario, supermassive black hole binaries --- established during dry\n(i.e. gas-poor) galaxy mergers --- kick out the stars from a galaxy's central\nregion via three-body interactions. Here, this \"binary black hole scouring\nscenario\" is probed at its extremes by investigating the two galaxies reported\nto have the largest partially-depleted cores found to date:\n2MASX~J09194427+5622012 and 2MASX~J17222717+3207571 (the brightest galaxy in\nAbell~2261). We have fit these galaxy's two-dimensional light distribution\nusing the core-S\\'{e}rsic model, and found that the former galaxy has a\ncore-S\\'{e}rsic break radius $R_{b,cS}=0.55$~kpc, three times smaller than the\npublished value. We use this galaxy to caution that other reportedly large\nbreak radii may too have been over-estimated if they were derived using the\n\"sharp-transition\" (inner core)-to-(outer S\\'{e}rsic) model.

However, it is unclear how molecules and grains are able to\ncondense within the ejecta, given the potentially harsh environment created by\nionizing radiation from the white dwarf. Motivated by the evidence for powerful\nradiative shocks within nova outflows, we propose that dust formation occurs\nwithin the cool, dense shell behind these shocks. We incorporate a simple\nmolecular chemistry network and classical nucleation theory with a model for\nthe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas, in order to demonstrate the\nformation of both carbon and forsterite ($\\rm Mg_2SiO_4$) grains. The high\ndensities due to radiative shock compression ($n \\sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$)\nresult in CO saturation and rapid dust nucleation. Grains grow efficiently to\nlarge sizes $\\gtrsim 0.1\\mu$m, in agreement with IR observations of\ndust-producing novae, and with total dust masses sufficient to explain massive\nextinction events such as V705 Cas. As in dense stellar winds, dust formation\nis CO-regulated, with carbon-rich flows producing carbon-rich grains and\noxygen-rich flows primarily forming silicates. CO is destroyed by non-thermal\nparticles accelerated at the shock, allowing additional grain formation at late\ntimes, but the efficiency of this process appears to be low. Given observations\nshowing that individual novae produce both carbonaceous and silicate grains, we\nconcur with previous works attributing this bimodality to chemical\nheterogeneity of the ejecta. Nova outflows are diverse and inhomogeneous, and\nthe observed variety of dust formation events can be reconciled by different\nabundances, the range of shock properties, and the observer viewing angle. The\nlatter may govern the magnitude of extinction, with the deepest extinction\nevents occurring for observers within the binary equatorial plane. \n\n"}

For four Milky Way-mass simulations, each\nrun both as dark matter-only and with baryons included, we are able to identify\na planar configuration that significantly maximizes the number of plane\nsatellite members. The maximum plane member satellites are consistently\ndifferent between the dark matter-only and baryonic versions of the same run\ndue to the fact that satellites are both more likely to be destroyed and to\ninfall later in the baryonic runs. Hence, studying satellite planes in dark\nmatter-only simulations is misleading, because they will be composed of\ndifferent satellite members than those that would exist if baryons were\nincluded. Additionally, the destruction of satellites in the baryonic runs\nleads to less radially concentrated satellite distributions, a result that is\ncritical to making planes that are statistically significant compared to a\nrandom distribution. Since all planes pass through the centre of the galaxy, it\nis much harder to create a plane from a random distribution if the satellites\nhave a low radial concentration.

One of the biggest observational challenges is to remove the\nforeground spectrum which is at least four orders of magnitude brighter than\nthe cosmological 21-cm emission.

We first show, by\nmeans of pure N-body simulations, that initially co-spatial stellar populations\nwith different in-plane random motions separate when a bar forms. The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution. Assuming that early stellar\ndiscs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random\nmotions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density\ndistributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars. We then use a\nhigh-resolution simulation, in which all stars form out of gas, to demonstrate\nthat this is what happens. When we apply these results to the Milky Way we show\nthat a very broad range of observed trends for ages, densities, kinematics and\nchemistries, that have been presented as evidence for contradictory paths to\nthe formation of the bulge, are in fact consistent with a bulge which formed\nfrom a continuum of disc stellar populations which were kinematically separated\nby the bar. For the first time we are able to account for the bulge's main\ntrends via a model in which the bulge formed largely in situ. Since the model\nis generic, we also predict the general appearance of stellar population maps\nof external edge-on galaxies. \n\n"}

Abstract: Blazars are active galactic nuclei (AGN) whose relativistic jets point nearly\nto the line of sight. Their compact radio structure can be imaged with very\nlong baseline interferometry (VLBI) on parsec scales. Blazars at extremely high\nredshifts provide a unique insight into the AGN phenomena in the early\nUniverse. We observed four radio sources at redshift $z>4$ with the European\nVLBI Network (EVN) at 1.7 and 5 GHz. These objects were previously classified\nas blazar candidates based on X-ray observations. One of them, J2134$-$0419 is\nfirmly confirmed as a blazar with our VLBI observations, due to its\nrelativistically beamed radio emission. Its radio jet extended to $\\sim$10\nmilli-arcsec scale makes this source a promising target for follow-up VLBI\nobservations to reveal any apparent proper motion. Another target, J0839+5112\nshows a compact radio structure typical of quasars. There is evidence for flux\ndensity variability and its radio \"core\" has a flat spectrum. However, the EVN\ndata suggest that its emission is not Doppler-boosted. The remaining two blazar\ncandidates (J1420+1205 and J2220+0025) show radio properties totally unexpected\nfrom radio AGN with small-inclination jet. Their emission extends to arcsec\nscales and the Doppler factors of the central components are well below 1.\nTheir structures resemble that of double-lobed radio AGN with large inclination\nto the line of sight. This is in contrast with the blazar-type modeling of\ntheir multi-band spectral energy distributions. Our work underlines the\nimportance of high-resolution VLBI imaging in confirming the blazar nature of\nhigh-redshift radio sources. \n\n"}

Using data\nfrom SDSS, we explore the evidence for such a feature in the density profiles\nof galaxy clusters and investigate the connection between this feature and a\npossible phase space boundary.

Here, we demonstrate that photogravitational\nassists are more effective when the star is used as a bumper (i.e. the sail\npasses \"in front of\" the star) rather than as a catapult (i.e. the sail passes\n\"behind\" or \"around\" the star). This increases the maximum deceleration at\n$\\alpha$ Cen A and B and reduces the travel time of a nominal graphene-class\nsail (mass-to-surface ratio 8.6e-4 gram m$^{-2}$) from 95 to 75 yr. The maximum\npossible velocity reduction upon arrival depends on the required deflection\nangle from $\\alpha$ Cen A to B and therefore on the binary's orbital phase.\nHere, we calculate the variation of the minimum travel times from Earth into a\nbound orbit around Proxima for the next 300 yr and then extend our calculations\nto roughly 22,000 stars within about 300 ly.

A moderate burst of star formation, dating between 20 and\n500 Myr ago and involving the outer parts of the galaxy more strongly than the\ninner regions, was likely induced by a first interaction of the galaxy with the\nintracluster medium. Stripping by ram pressure, plus probable gas depletion due\nto star formation, contributed to create a truncated ionized gas disk. The\npresence of an extended stellar tail on only one side of the disk, points\ninstead to another kind of process, likely a gravitational interaction by a\nfly-by or a close encounter with another galaxy in the cluster. \n\n"}

Using an idealized simulation of a cool-core cluster,\nwe study the development of central cooling catastrophe and how a subsequent\npowerful AGN jet event averts cooling flows, with a focus on complex\ngasdynamical processes involved. We find that the jet drives a bow shock, which\nreverses cooling inflows and overheats inner cool core regions. The shocked gas\nmoves outward in a rarefaction wave, which rarefies the dense core and\nadiabatically transports a significant fraction of heated energy to outer\nregions. As the rarefaction wave propagates away, inflows resume in the cluster\ncore, but a trailing outflow is uplifted by the AGN bubble, preventing gas\naccumulation and catastrophic cooling in central regions. Inflows and trailing\noutflows constitute meridional circulations in the cluster core. At later\ntimes, trailing outflows fall back to the cluster centre, triggering central\ncooling catastrophe and potentially a new generation of AGN feedback.

In fact,\nthe number of such in situ BBH mergers, per cluster, tend to increase\nsignificantly with the introduction of a small population of primordial\nbinaries.

We fit the observations\ndirectly in the uv-plane using a two-layer disk model that computes the 890\nmicron emission by solving the energy balance at each disk radius. For 22 out\nof 36 protoplanetary disks we derive robust estimates of their physical\nproperties.

Short bars of sub-kiloparsec radius have been hypothesized\nto be an important mechanism for driving gas inflows to small scale, feeding\ncentral BHs. In order to quantify the maximum BH mass allowed by this\nmechanism, we examine the robustness of short bars to the dynamical influence\nof BHs. Large-scale bars are expected to be robust, long-lived structures;\nextremely massive BHs, which are rare, are needed to completely destroy such\nbars. However, we find that short bars, which are generally embedded in\nlarge-scale outer bars, can be destroyed quickly when BHs of mass $M_{\\rm\nbh}\\sim0.05-0.2\\%$ of the total stellar mass ($M_\\star$) are present. In\nagreement with this prediction, all galaxies observed to host short bars have\nBHs with a mass fraction less than $0.2\\%M_\\star$.

It is often assumed that only very\nfew elemental abundances can be measured from such low-resolution spectra,\nlimiting their utility for Galactic archaeology studies. However, Ting et al.\n(2017) used ab initio models to argue that low-resolution spectra should enable\nprecision measurements of many elemental abundances, at least in theory. Here\nwe verify this claim in practice by measuring the relative abundances of 14\nelements from LAMOST spectra with a precision of $\\lesssim$ 0.1 dex for objects\nwith ${\\rm S/N}_{\\rm LAMOST}$ > 30 (per pixel). We employ a spectral modeling\nmethod in which a data-driven model is combined with priors that the model\ngradient spectra should resemble ab initio spectral models. This approach\nassures that the data-driven abundance determinations draw on physically\nsensible features in the spectrum in their predictions and do not just exploit\nastrophysical correlations among abundances. Our analysis is constrained to the\nnumber of elemental abundances measured in the APOGEE survey, which is the\nsource of the training labels. Obtaining high quality/resolution spectra for a\nsubset of LAMOST stars to measure more elemental abundances as training labels\nand then applying this method to the full LAMOST catalog will provide a sample\nwith more than 20 elemental abundances that is an order of magnitude larger\nthan current high-resolution surveys, substantially increasing the sample size\nfor Galactic archaeology. \n\n"}

Through\na systematic statistical study of data taken from October 2006 (from December\n2009 for the case of the 1.3mm observations) to August 2014, we characterise\nthe variability of the total flux density and linear polarisation. We find that\nall sources in the sample are highly variable in total flux density at both 3.5\nand 1.3mm, as well as in spectral index, that is found to be optically thin in\ngeneral. The total flux-density variability at 1.3mm is found, in general, to\nbe faster, and to have larger amplitude and flatter PSD slopes than 3.5mm. The\npolarisation degree is on average larger at 1.3mm than at 3.5mm, by a factor of\n2.6. The variability of linear polarisation degree is faster and has higher\nfractional amplitude than for total flux density, with the typical time scales\nduring prominent polarisation peaks being significantly faster at 1.3mm than at\n3.5mm. The polarisation angle at both 3.5 and 1.3mm is highly variable. Most of\nthe sources show one or two excursions of >180 deg. on time scales from a few\nweeks to about a year during the course of our observations. The 3.5 and 1.3mm\npolarisation angle evolution follow rather well each other, although the 1.3mm\ndata show a clear preference to more prominent variability on the short time\nscales, i.e. weeks.

Einstein\nsuggested a long-forgotten solution: gravitationally repulsive negative masses,\nwhich drive cosmic expansion and cannot coalesce into light-emitting\nstructures. However, contemporary cosmological results are derived upon the\nreasonable assumption that the Universe only contains positive masses. By\nreconsidering this assumption, I have constructed a toy model which suggests\nthat both dark phenomena can be unified into a single negative mass fluid. The\nmodel is a modified $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and indicates that\ncontinuously-created negative masses can resemble the cosmological constant and\ncan flatten the rotation curves of galaxies. The model leads to a cyclic\nuniverse with a time-variable Hubble parameter, potentially providing\ncompatibility with the current tension that is emerging in cosmological\nmeasurements. In the first three-dimensional N-body simulations of negative\nmass matter in the scientific literature, this exotic material naturally forms\nhaloes around galaxies that extend to several galactic radii. These haloes are\nnot cuspy. The proposed cosmological model is therefore able to predict the\nobserved distribution of dark matter in galaxies from first principles.

These findings may imply that\nnegative masses are a real and physical aspect of our Universe, or\nalternatively may imply the existence of a superseding theory that in some\nlimit can be modelled by effective negative masses. Both cases lead to the\nsurprising conclusion that the compelling puzzle of the dark Universe may have\nbeen due to a simple sign error. \n\n"}

The approaching stars from the star cluster to the\nblack hole can take three types of orbit: eccentric, parabolic, and hyperbolic\norbits. Since the mass fallback rate shows a different variability depending on\nthese orbital types, we can classify tidal disruption events (TDEs) into three\nmain categories: eccentric, parabolic, and hyperbolic TDEs. Respective TDEs are\ncharacterized by two critical values of the orbital eccentricity: the lower\ncritical eccentricity is the one below which the stars on eccentric orbits\ncause the finite, intense accretion, and the higher critical eccentricity above\nwhich the stars on hyperbolic orbits cause no accretion. Moreover, we find that\nthe parabolic TDEs are divided into three subclasses: precisely parabolic,\nmarginally eccentric, and marginally hyperbolic TDEs. We analytically derive\nthat the mass fallback rate of the marginally eccentric TDEs can be flatter and\nslightly higher than the standard fallback rate proportional to $t^{-5/3}$,\nwhereas it can be flatter and lower for the marginally hyperbolic TDEs. We\nconfirm by N-body experiments that only few eccentric, precisely parabolic, and\nhyperbolic TDEs can occur in a spherical stellar system with a single\nintermediate-mass to supermassive black hole. A substantial fraction of the\nstars approaching to the black hole would cause the marginally eccentric or\nmarginally hyperbolic TDEs. \n\n"}

High Frequency Instrument data processing and\n  frequency maps Abstract: This paper presents the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) data processing\nprocedures for the Planck 2018 release. Major improvements in mapmaking have\nbeen achieved since the previous 2015 release. They enabled the first\nsignificant measurement of the reionization optical depth parameter using HFI\ndata. This paper presents an extensive analysis of systematic effects,\nincluding the use of simulations to facilitate their removal and characterize\nthe residuals. The polarized data, which presented a number of known problems\nin the 2015 Planck release, are very significantly improved. Calibration, based\non the CMB dipole, is now extremely accurate and in the frequency range 100 to\n353 GHz reduces intensity-to-polarization leakage caused by calibration\nmismatch. The Solar dipole direction has been determined in the three lowest\nHFI frequency channels to within one arc minute, and its amplitude has an\nabsolute uncertainty smaller than $0.35\\mu$K, an accuracy of order $10^{-4}$.\nThis is a major legacy from the HFI for future CMB experiments. The removal of\nbandpass leakage has been improved by extracting the bandpass-mismatch\ncoefficients for each detector as part of the mapmaking process; these values\nin turn improve the intensity maps. This is a major change in the philosophy of\n\"frequency maps\", which are now computed from single detector data, all\nadjusted to the same average bandpass response for the main foregrounds.\nSimulations reproduce very well the relative gain calibration of detectors, as\nwell as drifts within a frequency induced by the residuals of the main\nsystematic effect. Using these simulations, we measure and correct the small\nfrequency calibration bias induced by this systematic effect at the $10^{-4}$\nlevel. There is no detectable sign of a residual calibration bias between the\nfirst and second acoustic peaks in the CMB channels, at the $10^{-3}$ level. \n\n"}

In\nagreement with observations, we find that star-forming satellite galaxies\ninside galaxy clusters are characterised by more radially dominated orbits,\nindependent of cluster mass. Furthermore, the vast majority of star-forming\nsatellite galaxies stop forming stars during their first passage. We find a\nstrong dichotomy both in line-of-sight and radial phase space between\nstar-forming and quiescent galaxies, in line with observations. The tracking of\nindividual orbits shows that the star-formation of almost all satellite\ngalaxies drops to zero within $1 \\, \\mathrm{Gyr}$ after in-fall. Satellite\ngalaxies that are able to remain star-forming longer are characterised by\ntangential orbits and high stellar mass.

While radio bubbles inflated by AGN jets\ncould be dynamically supported by cosmic rays (CRs), the impact of CR-dominated\njets are not well understood. In this work, we perform three-dimensional\nsimulations of CR-jet feedback in an isolated cluster atmosphere; we find that\nCR jets impact the multiphase gas differently than jets dominated by kinetic\nenergy. In particular, CR bubbles can more efficiently uplift the cluster gas\nand cause an outward expansion of the hot ICM. Due to adiabatic cooling from\nthe expansion and less efficient heating from CR bubbles by direct mixing, the\nICM is more prone to local thermal instabilities, which will later enhance\nchaotic cold accretion onto the AGN. The amount of cold gas formed during the\nbubble formation and its late-time evolution sensitively depend on whether CR\ntransport processes are included or not. We also find that low-level, subsonic\ndriving of turbulence by AGN jets holds for both kinetic and CR jets;\nnevertheless, the kinematics is consistent with the Hitomi measurements.\nFinally, we carefully discuss the key observable signatures of each bubble\nmodel, focusing on gamma-ray emission (and related comparison with Fermi), as\nwell as thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints. \n\n"}

In FDM models, the dark matter is\nenvisaged to be an ultra-light scalar field with a particle mass $m_{\\rm FDM}\n\\sim 10^{-22} $ eV.

The method uses Gaussian Processes to create smooth SFHs that are\nindependent of any functional form, with a flexible number of parameters that\nis adjusted to extract the maximum possible amount of SFH information from the\nSEDs being fit. We apply the method to reconstruct the SFHs of 48,791 galaxies\nwith $H<25$ at $0.5 < z < 3.0$ across the five CANDELS fields. Using these\nSFHs, we study the evolution of galaxies as they grow more massive over cosmic\ntime. We quantify the fraction of galaxies that show multiple major episodes of\nstar formation, finding that the median time between two peaks of star\nformation is $\\sim 0.42_{-0.10}^{+0.15}t_{univ}$ Gyr, where $t_{univ}$ is the\nage of the universe at a given redshift and remains roughly constant with\nstellar mass.

The pulsations are stronger for more\nmassive He cores and result in such a large amount of mass ejection such as $3\n- 13$ $M_\\odot$ for $40 - 62 ~M_\\odot$ He cores.

This shear can be responsible for a very rapid shear--driven\ninstability that arises for any velocity profile.

The\ninstability leads to rapid fluctuations of the main hydrodynamical parameters\n(density, pressure, Lorentz factor, etc.).

Our method employs a series of nested computational grids,\nwhich allows the simulations to follow the central wind out to scales of tens\nof AU, where it may interact with its surroundings. The coupling between the\nstellar magnetosphere and disc inner edge has been known to produce an outflow\ncontaining both a highly collimated jet plus a wide-angle flow. The jet and\nwide-angle wind flow at roughly the same speed (100--200 km/s), and most of the\nenergy and mass is carried off at relatively wide angles.

The sample contains 38% of the total number of\nidentified galaxies in the first two fields of the survey with z>1.3. The\nselected objects have colors typical of irregular and Sbc galaxies. Strong\n[OII] emission indicates high star formation activity in the HII regions\n(SFR~13-106 M_sun/yr). The high S/N composite spectrum shows strong ISM MgII\nand FeII absorption, together with weak MnII and MgI lines. The FeII column\ndensity, derived using the curve of growth analysis, is logN_FeII =\n15.54^{+0.23}_{-0.13}. This is considerably larger than typical values found in\ndamped Ly-alpha systems (DLAs) along QSO sight lines, where only 10 out of 87\n(~11%) have logN_FeII > 15.2. High FeII column densities are observed in the\nz=2.72 Lyman break galaxy cB58 (logN_FeII ~ 15.25) and in gamma-ray burst host\ngalaxies (logN_FeII ~ 14.8-15.9).

The orbital decay rate is often severely overestimated\nif applying the ChandraSekhar's formula without correcting for (a) the\nevaporation and tidal loss of the satellite and (b) the contraction of\nsatellite orbits due to adiabatic growth of the host galaxy potential over the\nHubble time. As a satellite migrates inwards, the increasing halo density\naffects the dynamical friction in two opposite ways:(1) it boosts the number of\nhalo particles swept in the satellite's gravitational \"wake\", hence increasing\nthe drag on the satellite, and (2) it boosts the tide which \"peels off\" the\nsatellite, and reduces the amplitude of the wake.

The relation between the measured M/L\nevolution and mass is partially due to selection effects.

In this paper we present a simple model for computing the\ncharacteristic quantities (including energy, temperature, and time-duration)\nfor the transient event from the shock breakout in Type Ibc supernovae produced\nby the core-collapse of WR stars surrounded by dense winds. In contrast to the\ncase of a star without a strong wind, the shock breakout occurs in the wind\nregion rather than inside the star, caused by the large optical depth in the\nwind. We find that, for the case of a WR star with a dense wind, the total\nenergy of the radiation generated by the supernova shock breakout is larger\nthan that in the case of the same star without a wind by a factor > 10. The\ntemperature can be either hotter or cooler, depending on the wind parameters.\nThe time-duration is larger caused by the increase in the effective radius of\nthe star due to the presence of a thick wind.

They rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominant\nSF episode of galaxies, after which SF gradually declines on Gyr timescales to\nz=0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy's M_*. With decreasing mass, this onset of\nmajor SF shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies (staged\ngalaxy formation). This process may be an important component of the\n``downsizing'' phenomenon. We find that the predominantly gradual decline of\nSFR (Noeske et al. 2007, this volume) can be reproduced by exponential SF\nhistories (tau models), if less massive galaxies have systematically longer\ne-folding times tau, and a later onset of SF (z_f). Our model can provide a\nfirst parametrization of SFR as a function of M_* and z, and quantify\nmass-dependences of tau and z_f, from direct observations of M_* and SFR up to\nz>1.

Rhoads (1999) has pointed out that the\ndynamics of the blast wave, which is formed when the beamed ejecta sweeping the\nexternal medium, will be significantly modified by the sideways expansion due\nto the increased swept up matter. He claimed that shortly after the bulk\nLorentz factor ($\\Gamma $) of the blast wave drops below the inverse of the\ninitial opening angle ($\\theta_{0}$) of the beamed ejecta, there will be a\nsharp break in the afterglow light curves.

The universe has no initial\nsingularity and the dynamics of string winding modes allow three spatial\ndimensions to grow large, providing a possible solution to the dimensionality\nproblem of string theory. \n\n"}

In this paper we study alternative\ngravitational theories defined by Lagrangians which depend on general functions\nof the Ricci scalar invariant in minimal interaction with matter, in view of\ntheir possible cosmological applications. Structural equations for the\nspacetimes described by such theories are solved and the corresponding field\nequations are investigated in the Palatini formalism, which prevents\ninstability problems. Particular examples of these theories are also shown to\nprovide, under suitable hypotheses, a coherent theoretical explanation of\nearlier results concerning the present acceleration of the universe and\ncosmological inflation. We suggest moreover a new possible Lagrangian,\ndepending on the inverse of sinh(R), which gives an explanation to the present\nacceleration of the universe. \n\n"}

We\nassume that the initial and final stages of the background cosmological model\nare given by de Sitter and Minkowski phases, respectively, and they are\nconnected smoothly by a radiation-dominated phase. This setup allows us to\ndiscuss the quantum-mechanical generation of the perturbations and to see the\nfinal amplitude of the well-defined zero mode. Using the Wronskian formulation,\nwe numerically compute the power spectrum of gravitational waves, and find that\nthe effect of initial vacuum fluctuations in the Kaluza-Klein modes is\nsubdominant, contributing not more than 10% of the total power spectrum. Thus\nit is confirmed that the damping due to the Kaluza-Klein mode generation and\nthe enhancement due to the modification of the background Friedmann equation\nare the two dominant effects, but they cancel each other, leading to the same\nspectral tilt as the standard four-dimensional result. Kaluza-Klein gravitons\nthat escape from the brane contribute to the energy density of the dark\nradiation at late times. We show that a tiny amount of the dark radiation is\ngenerated due to this process. \n\n"}

The prediction is a consequence of a large number of\nmetastable string vacua, and the properties of the Coleman--De Luccia instanton\nwhich describes vacuum tunneling. We examine the robustness of this claim,\nwhich is of particular importance since it seems to be one of string theory's\nfew claims to falsifiability. We find that, due to subleading tunneling\nprocesses, the prediction is sensitive to unknown properties of the landscape.\nUnder plausible assumptions, universes like ours are as likely to be closed as\nopen. \n\n"}

It is also suggested that an inflation with\nthe number of e-folds $N\\simeq 65$ may solve the cosmic coincidence problem in\nthis context. Assuming the inflation and the power-law acceleration phase today\nwe obtain approximate formulas for the event horizon size of the universe and\ndark energy density as functions of time. A simple numerical study exploiting\nthe formula well reproduces the observed evolution of dark energy. This\nnontrivial match between the theory and the observational data supports both\ninflation and holographic dark energy models. \n\n"}
