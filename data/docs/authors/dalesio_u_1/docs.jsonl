The main characteristic of\nholographic Ricci dark energy is governed by a positive numerical parameter\n$\\alpha$ in the model.

We analyze the\nbehavior in the nuclear medium of the rich spectrum of dynamically-generated\nbaryonic resonances in the C=1 and S=0 sector, and their influence in the\nself-energy and, hence, the spectral function of the $D$ and $D^*$ mesons.

Through the realization of the equivalence principle, which is an\nintrinsic property in symplectic geometry known as the Darboux theorem or the\nMoser lemma, one can understand how diffeomorphism symmetry arises from\nnoncommutative U(1) gauge theory; thus, gravity can emerge from the\nnoncommutative electromagnetism, which is also an interacting theory. As a\nconsequence, a background-independent quantum gravity in which the prior\nexistence of any spacetime structure is not a priori assumed but is defined by\nusing the fundamental ingredients in quantum gravity theory can be formulated.\nThis scheme for quantum gravity can be used to resolve many notorious problems\nin theoretical physics, such as the cosmological constant problem, to\nunderstand the nature of dark energy, and to explain why gravity is so weak\ncompared to other forces. In particular, it leads to a remarkable picture of\nwhat matter is. A matter field, such as leptons and quarks, simply arises as a\nstable localized geometry, which is a topological object in the defining\nalgebra (noncommutative $\\star$-algebra) of quantum gravity. \n\n"}

In this\nmodel, matter and gauge superfields reside in the 5D bulk while a SUSY breaking\nsector and the Higgs doublet superfields are localized on the infrared brane.\nThe Yukawa coupling hierarchy in SM can be naturally explained through the\nwavefunction localization of the matter superfields. While sparticles obtain\ntheir flavor-blind soft SUSY breaking masses dominantly from the\ngaugino-mediated SUSY breaking, flavor-violating soft terms arise through the\ngravity-mediated SUSY breaking which are controlled by the wavefunction\nlocalization of the matter superfields.

These short-distance interactions influence the intrinsic transverse\nmomentum distributions of partons and their correlations at a low normalization\npoint. We study this phenomenon in an effective description of low-energy\ndynamics based on chiral constituent quark degrees of freedom, which refers to\nthe large-N_c limit of QCD. The nucleon is obtained as a system of constituent\nquarks and antiquarks moving in a self-consistent classical chiral field\n(chiral quark-soliton model). The calculated distributions of constituent\nquarks/antiquarks are matched with QCD partons at the scale rho^{-2}. The p_T\ndistribution of valence quarks is localized at p_T^2 ~ R^{-2} and roughly of\nGaussian shape. The sea quark distribution exhibits a would-be power-like tail\n~1/p_T^2 extending up to the chiral symmetry-breaking scale. Such behavior is\nseen in the flavor-singlet unpolarized and nonsinglet polarized sea. The\nhigh-momentum tails are the result of short-range correlations between sea\nquarks in the nucleon's light-cone wave function, analogous to NN correlations\nin nuclei. The nucleon wave function contains correlated pairs of transverse\nsize rho << R with sigma- and pi-like quantum numbers, whose internal wave\nfunctions become identical at p_T^2 ~ rho^{-2} (restoration of chiral\nsymmetry).

This\nasymmetry is known to arise due to the transverse spin dependence of the target\nproton combined with a T-odd complex phase. Using the discrete symmetry\nproperties of transverse spinors, we show that the required complex phase\noriginates in the denominators of rescattering diagrams and their respective\ncuts.

Physically, this fundamental, but yet\nuntested, prediction occurs because the Sivers effect in the Drell-Yan reaction\nis modified by the initial-state \"lensing\" interactions of the annihilating\nantiquark, in contrast to the final-state lensing which produces the Sivers\neffect in deep inelastic scattering. \n\n"}

The TMD factorization based approach indicates that the\npeak of the Sivers asymmetry falls off with energy scale Q to good\napproximation as 1/Q^{0.7}, somewhat faster than found previously based on the\nfirst TMD factorization expressions by Collins and Soper in 1981.

Also the LHC analysis\nsuggests that it is {\\it scalar} namely $J^P = 0^+$ rather than pseudo-scalar.\nThus it is unlikely that the \"Higgs\" could arise as a composite in such\ntheories- though it will arise in special cases when the underlying binding\ngauge group is real as a fermion-fermion bound state.\n  The direct considerations of the various two point functions in the large\n$N_c$ limit presented below- suggest that massless pseudo-scalars, but not any\nother anomalously light meson, arise as composites of massless fermions say the\nmassless u and $\\bar{d}$ quarks in QCD. These massless pions manifest the\nspontaneous breaking of the global axial symmetry in QCD with the pions being\n(pseudo) Nambu Goldstone Bosons. This offers a different insight into SXSB in\nQCD and most other confining non-abelian gauge vectorial gauge theory.\nSpecifically we consider the euclidean two point functions $F_I|x-y|$ for\nasymptotic $|x-y|$ expressed as a sum over fermionic paths. We conjecture that\nfor the pseudo-scalar two point function - and for that case only- self\nretracing paths and closely related paths make in this limit a positive,\ncoherent and dominant contribution, a contribution which evades the generic\nasymptotic exponential fall-off and allows the lightest pseudoscalars to be\nmassless. The same arguments imply that the scalars are very massive. \n\n"}

The mathematical problem of solving the full nonlinear\nrelativistic Boltzmann equation is recast into an infinite set of nonlinear\nordinary differential equations for the moments of the one-particle\ndistribution function.

Abstract: Familiar factorized descriptions of classic QCD processes such as\ndeeply-inelastic scattering (DIS) apply in the limit of very large hard scales,\nmuch larger than nonperturbative mass scales and other nonperturbative physical\nproperties like intrinsic transverse momentum. Since many interesting DIS\nstudies occur at kinematic regions where the hard scale, $Q \\sim$ 1-2 GeV, is\nnot very much greater than the hadron masses involved, and the Bjorken scaling\nvariable $x_{bj}$ is large, $x_{bj} \\gtrsim 0.5$, it is important to examine\nthe boundaries of the most basic factorization assumptions and assess whether\nimproved starting points are needed. Using an idealized field-theoretic model\nthat contains most of the essential elements that a factorization derivation\nmust confront, we retrace the steps of factorization approximations and compare\nwith calculations that keep all kinematics exact. We examine the relative\nimportance of such quantities as the target mass, light quark masses, and\nintrinsic parton transverse momentum, and argue that a careful accounting of\nparton virtuality is essential for treating power corrections to collinear\nfactorization. We use our observations to motivate searches for new or enhanced\nfactorization theorems specifically designed to deal with moderately low-$Q$\nand large-$x_{bj}$ physics. \n\n"}

Abstract: A low-energy supersymmetry scenario with a light gluino of mass 12 - 16 GeV\nand light sbottom (b1) of mass 2 - 6 GeV has been used to explain the apparent\noverproduction of b quarks at the Tevatron. In this scenario the other mass\neigenstate of the sbottom, i.e. b2, is favored to be lighter than 180 GeV due\nto constraints from electroweak precision data. We survey its decay modes in\nthis scenario and show that decay into a b quark and gluino should be dominant.\nAssociated sbottom production at LEP via e+ e- -> Z* -> b1 b2* + b1* b2 is\nstudied and we show that it is naturally a three-jet process with a small\ncross-section, increasingly obscured by a large Standard Model background for\nheavier b2.

The\nsplitting between the chiral doublers follows from a mixing between the light\nconstituent quark mass and the velocity of the heavy quark, and vanishes for a\nzero constituent quark mass. The general strictures of spontaneous chiral\nsymmetry breaking constrain the axial charges in the chiral multiplet, and\nyield a mass splitting between the chiral doublers of about 345 MeV when the\npion coupling to the doublers is half its coupling to a free quark. The chiral\ncorrections are small. This phenomenon is generic and extends to all\nheavy-light hadrons. We predict the mass splitting for the chiral doublers of\nthe excited mesons (D1,D2). We suggest that the heavy-light doubling can be\nused to address issues of chiral symmetry restoration in dense and/or hot\nhadronic matter.

Using this method, all amplitudes for such decays can be expressed in\nterms of contractions, though the matrix elements are not evaluated. Many years\nago, Buras and Silvestrini proposed a similar approach. However, our technique\ngoes beyond theirs in several ways. First, we include recent theoretical and\nexperimental developments which indicate which contractions are negligible, and\nwhich are expected to be smaller than others. Second, we show that all B-decay\ndiagrams can be simply expressed in terms of contractions. This constitutes a\nformal proof that the diagrammatic method is rigourous. Third, we show that one\nreproduces the relations between tree and electroweak-penguin diagrams\ndescribed by Neubert and Rosner, and by Gronau, Pirjol and Yan. Fourth,\nalthough the previous results hold to all orders in alpha_s, we show that it is\nalso possible to work order-by-order in this approach. In this way it is\npossible to make a connection with the matrix-element evaluation methods of QCD\nfactorization (QCDfac) and perturbative QCD (pQCD). Finally, using the\ncontractions approach, we re-evaluate the question of whether there is a ``B ->\npi K puzzle.'' At O(alpha_s^0), we find that the diagram ratio |C'/T| is about\n0.17, a factor of 10 too small to explain all the B -> pi K data. Both QCDfac\nand pQCD find that, at O(\\alpha_s^1), the value of |C'/T'| may be raised to\nonly about 2-3 times its lowest-order value. We therefore conclude that,\nassuming the effect is not a statistical fluctuation, it is likely that the\nvalue of |C'/T'| is similar to its O(\\alpha_s^0) result, and that there really\nis a B -> pi K puzzle. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-ph/9803315", "contents": "Title: The Hierarchy Problem and New Dimensions at a Millimeter Abstract: We propose a new framework for solving the hierarchy problem which does not\nrely on either supersymmetry or technicolor. In this framework, the\ngravitational and gauge interactions become united at the weak scale, which we\ntake as the only fundamental short distance scale in nature. The observed\nweakness of gravity on distances $\\gsim$ 1 mm is due to the existence of $n\n\\geq 2$ new compact spatial dimensions large compared to the weak scale. The\nPlanck scale $M_{Pl} \\sim G_N^{-1/2}$ is not a fundamental scale; its enormity\nis simply a consequence of the large size of the new dimensions. While\ngravitons can freely propagate in the new dimensions, at sub-weak energies the\nStandard Model (SM) fields must be localized to a 4-dimensional manifold of\nweak scale \"thickness\" in the extra dimensions. This picture leads to a number\nof striking signals for accelerator and laboratory experiments. For the case of\n$n=2$ new dimensions, planned sub-millimeter measurements of gravity may\nobserve the transition from $1/r^2 \\to 1/r^4$ Newtonian gravitation. For any\nnumber of new dimensions, the LHC and NLC could observe strong quantum\ngravitational interactions. Furthermore, SM particles can be kicked off our 4\ndimensional manifold into the new dimensions, carrying away energy, and leading\nto an abrupt decrease in events with high transverse momentum $p_T \\gsim$ TeV.\nFor certain compact manifolds, such particles will keep circling in the extra\ndimensions, periodically returning, colliding with and depositing energy to our\nfour dimensional vacuum with frequencies of $ \\sim 10^{12}$ Hz or larger.

In the bosonic sector, the leading channel\nof particle production is the non-perturbative regime of parametric resonance,\npreheating, during which bosons are created exponentially fast. Pauli blocking\nprohibits the unbounded creation of fermions. For this reason, it has been\nsilently assumed that the creation of fermions can be treated with perturbation\ntheory for the decay of individual inflatons. We consider the production of\nfermions interacting with the coherently oscillating inflatons. We find that\nthe actual particle production occurs in a regime of the parametric excitation\nof fermions, leading to preheating of fermions.

Based on the same\nprinciples as QMD and RQMD, it incorporates a vastly extended collision term\nwith full baryon-antibaryon symmetry, 55 baryon and 32 meson species. Isospin\nis explicitly treated for all hadrons. The range of applicability stretches\nfrom $E_{lab}< 100$ MeV/nucleon up to $E_{lab}> 200$ GeV/nucleon, allowing for\na consistent calculation of excitation functions from the intermediate energy\ndomain up to ultrarelativistic energies. The main physics topics under\ndiscussion are stopping, particle production and collective flow. \n\n"}

In covariant gauges the dressing of the gluon\npropagator is completely specified by P(k^2):= 1/[1+Pi(k^2)], where Pi(k^2) is\nthe vacuum polarisation. In the absence of particle-like singularities in the\ndressed-quark-gluon vertex, extant proposals for the dressed-gluon propagator\nthat manifest P(k^2=0)=0 and Max[P(k^2)]~10 neither confine quarks nor break\nchiral symmetry dynamically. This class includes all existing estimates of\nP(k^2) via numerical simulations. \n\n"}

Polarized atoms from a Stern-Gerlach Atomic Beam\nSource are injected into a storage cell internal to the HERA electron ring.\nAtoms diffusing from the center of the storage cell into a side tube are\nanalyzed to determine the atomic fraction and the atomic polarizations. The\natoms have a nuclear polarization, the axis of which is defined by an external\nmagnetic holding field. The holding field was longitudinal during 1996-2000,\nand was changed to transverse in 2001. The design of the target is described,\nthe method for analyzing the target polarization is outlined, and the\nperformance of the target in the various running periods is presented. \n\n"}
