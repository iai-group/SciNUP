Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

For this purpose data have been used from INTEGRAL, RXTE and\nXMM-Newton. The INTEGRAL hard X-ray (>10 keV) time-averaged total spectrum, can\nbe described by a power law with a photon index Gamma = 1.13 +/- 0.06 and\nextends to ~175 keV. No evidence for a spectral break is found. No significant\nlong-term time variability has been detected above 20 keV. Pulsed emission is\nmeasured up to 270 keV (12.3 sigma; 20-270 keV). Three different pulse\ncomponents can be recognized in the pulse profiles: 1) a hard pulse which\ncontributes above ~4 keV, 2) a softer pulse not contributing in the hard X-ray\ndomain and 3) a very soft pulse component below 2 keV. Detailed phase-resolved\nspectroscopy of the pulsed emission confirms long-term stability. The spectral\nshape gradually changes with phase from a soft single power law to a complex\nmulti-component shape and then to a hard single power law.

If the force carrier is a\nnon-Abelian gauge boson, the dark matter is part of a multiplet of states, and\nsplittings between these states are naturally generated with size alpha m_phi ~\nMeV, leading to the eXciting dark matter (XDM) scenario previously proposed to\nexplain the positron annihilation in the galactic center observed by the\nINTEGRAL satellite. Somewhat smaller splittings would also be expected,\nproviding a natural source for the parameters of the inelastic dark matter\n(iDM) explanation for the DAMA annual modulation signal. Since the Sommerfeld\nenhancement is most significant at low velocities, early dark matter halos at\nredshift ~10 potentially produce observable effects on the ionization history\nof the universe, and substructure is more detectable than with a conventional\nWIMP. Moreover, the low velocity dispersion of dwarf galaxies and Milky Way\nsubhalos can greatly increase the substructure annihilation signal. \n\n"}

The WIMP is taken to be\ncharged under a hidden gauge symmetry G_Dark, broken near the GeV scale; this\nalso provides the necessary ingredients for the \"exciting\" and \"inelastic\" Dark\nMatter interpretations of the INTEGRAL and DAMA signals. In this short note we\npoint out the consequences of the most straightforward embedding of this simple\npicture within low-energy SUSY, in which G_Dark breaking at the GeV scale\narises naturally through radiative corrections, or Planck-suppressed operators.\nThe theory predicts major additions to SUSY signals at the LHC. A completely\ngeneric prediction is that G_Dark particles can be produced in cascade decays\nof MSSM superpartners, since these end with pairs of MSSM LSP's that in turn\ndecay into the true LSP and other particles in the dark sector. In turn, the\nlightest GeV-scale dark Higgses and gauge bosons eventually decay back into\nlight SM states, and dominantly into leptons. Therefore, a large fraction of\nall SUSY events will contain at least two ``lepton jets'': collections of n>= 2\nleptons, with small angular separations and GeV scale invariant masses.\nFurthermore, if the Dark Matter sector is directly charged under the Standard\nModel, the success of gauge coupling unification implies the presence of new\nlong-lived colored particles that can be copiously produced at the LHC. \n\n"}

In this paper,\nwe present a survey of concrete models realizing such a scenario, followed by a\nlargely model-independent study of collider phenomenology relevant to the\nTevatron and the LHC. We address some model building issues that are easily\nsurmounted to accommodate the astrophysics. While SUSY is not necessary, we\nargue that it is theoretically well-motivated because the GeV scale is\nautomatically generated. Specifically, we propose a novel mechanism by which\nmixed D-terms in the dark sector induce either SUSY breaking or a super-Higgs\nmechanism precisely at a GeV.

However, with only radial\nvelocity data, it is impossible to determine if these planets are rocky or\ngaseous. Here we exploit various dynamical features of the system in order to\nassess the physical properties of the planets. Observations allow for circular\norbits, but a numerical integration shows that the eccentricities must be at\nleast 0.0001. Also, planets b and c are so close to the star that tidal effects\nare significant. If planet b has tidal parameters similar to the terrestrial\nplanets in the Solar System and a remnant eccentricity larger than 0.001, then,\ngoing back in time, the system would have been unstable within the lifetime of\nthe star (which we estimate to be 6.1 +/- 1.6 Gyr). Moreover, if the\neccentricities are that large and the inner planet is rocky, then its tidal\nheating may be an order of magnitude greater than extremely volcanic Io, on a\nper unit surface area basis. If planet b is not terrestrial, e.g. Neptune-like,\nthese physical constraints would not apply. This analysis suggests the planets\nare not terrestrial-like, and are more like our giant planets.

Gaussian\n  fluctuations with non-markovian dependence on the smoothing scale Abstract: A classic method for computing the mass function of dark matter halos is\nprovided by excursion set theory, where density perturbations evolve\nstochastically with the smoothing scale, and the problem of computing the\nprobability of halo formation is mapped into the so-called first-passage time\nproblem in the presence of a barrier. While the full dynamical complexity of\nhalo formation can only be revealed through N-body simulations, excursion set\ntheory provides a simple analytic framework for understanding various aspects\nof this complex process. In this series of paper we propose improvements of\nboth technical and conceptual aspects of excursion set theory, and we explore\nup to which point the method can reproduce quantitatively the data from N-body\nsimulations. In paper I of the series we show how to derive excursion set\ntheory from a path integral formulation. This allows us both to derive\nrigorously the absorbing barrier boundary condition, that in the usual\nformulation is just postulated, and to deal analytically with the non-markovian\nnature of the random walk. Such a non-markovian dynamics inevitably enters when\neither the density is smoothed with filters such as the top-hat filter in\ncoordinate space (which is the only filter associated to a well defined halo\nmass) or when one considers non-Gaussian fluctuations. In these cases, beside\n``markovian'' terms, we find ``memory'' terms that reflect the non-markovianity\nof the evolution with the smoothing scale. We develop a general formalism for\nevaluating perturbatively these non-markovian corrections, and in this paper we\nperform explicitly the computation of the halo mass function for gaussian\nfluctuations, to first order in the non-markovian corrections due to the use of\na tophat filter in coordinate space. \n\n"}

The theory of\ngravitational aether is an alternative to general relativity that does not\nsuffer from this fine-tuning problem, as it decouples the quantum field theory\nvacuum from geometry, while remaining consistent with other tests of gravity.\nIn this paper, we study static black hole solutions in this theory and show\nthat it manifests a UV-IR coupling: Aether couples the spacetime metric close\nto the black hole horizon, to metric at infinity.

The data are taken from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep\nSurvey, DEEP2, and COMBO-17. The use of clustering allows us to determine what\nfraction of the red sequence is made up of central galaxies and satellite\ngalaxies. At all redshifts, including z=0, the data are consistent with ~60% of\nsatellite galaxies being red or quenched, implying that ~1/3 of the red\nsequence is comprised of satellite galaxies. More than three-fourths of red\nsatellite galaxies were moved to the red sequence after they were accreted onto\na larger halo. The constant fraction of satellite galaxies that are red yields\na quenching time for satellite galaxies that depends on redshift in the same\nway as halo dynamical times; t_Q ~ (1+z)^{-1.5}. In three of the four samples,\nthe data favor a model in which red central galaxies are a random sample of all\ncentral galaxies; there is no preferred halo mass scale at which galaxies make\nthe transition from star-forming to red and dead.

This line is thought to be\nproduced by X-ray irradiation of the warm protoplanetary disk atmospheres,\nhowever the observational correlation between [Ne II] luminosities and measured\nX-ray luminosities shows a large scatter. Such spread limits the utility of\nthis line as a probe of the gaseous phase of disks, as several authors have\nsuggested pollution by outflows as a probable cause of the observed scatter. In\nthis work we explore the possibility that the large variations in the observed\n[Ne II] luminosity may be caused instead by different star-disk parameters. In\nparticular we study the effects that the hardness of the irradiating source and\nthe structure (flaring) of the disk have on the luminosity and spectral profile\nof the [Ne II] 12.8 micron line. We find that varying these parameter can\nindeed cause up to an order of magnitude variation in the emission luminosities\nwhich may explain the scatter observed, although our models predict somewhat\nsmaller luminosities than those recently reported by other authors who observed\nthe line with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our models also show that the\nhardness of the spectrum has only a limited (undetectable) effect on the line\nprofiles, while changes in the flaring power of the disk significantly affect\nthe size of the [Ne II] emission region and, as a consequence, its line\nprofile. In particular we suggest that broad line profiles centred on the\nstellar radial velocity may be indicative of flat disks seen at large\ninclination angles. \n\n"}

The\nspectrum of the 8 o'clock arc is rich in stellar and interstellar medium (ISM)\nfeatures, and presents several similarities to the well-known MS1512-cB58 LBG.\nThe stellar photospheric absorption lines allowed us to constrain the systemic\nredshift, z_sys = 2.7350+/-0.0003, of the galaxy, and derive its stellar\nmetallicity, Z=0.82 Z_sol. With a total stellar mass of ~4.2x10^{11} M_sol, the\n8 o'clock arc agrees with the mass-metallicity relation found for z>2\nstar-forming galaxies. The 31 ISM absorption lines detected led to the\nabundance measurements of 9 elements. The metallicity of the ISM, Z=0.65 Z_sol\n(Si), is very comparable to the metallicity of stars and ionized gas, and\nsuggests that the ISM of the 8 o'clock arc has been rapidly polluted and\nenriched by ejecta of OB stars. The ISM lines extend over ~1000 km/s and have\ntheir peak optical depth blueshifted relative to the stars, implying gas\noutflows of about -120 km/s. The Ly-alpha line is dominated by a damped\nabsorption profile on top of which is superposed a weak emission, redshifted\nrelative to the ISM lines by about +690 km/s and resulting from multiply\nbackscattered Ly-alpha photons emitted in the HII region surrounded by the\ncold, expanding ISM shell. A homogeneous spherical radiation transfer shell\nmodel with a constant outflow velocity, determined by the observations, is able\nto reproduce the observed Ly-alpha line profile and dust content.

This has been attributed to tidal interaction, but needs to be\ninvestigated in more detail considering also other possible explanations\nbecause in several cases the tidal synchronization time scales are much longer\nthan the ages of the stars. We select stars harbouring transiting hot Jupiters\nto study their rotation and find that those with an effective temperature\ngreater than 6000 K and a rotation period shorter than 10 days are synchronized\nwith the orbital motion of their planets or have a rotation period\napproximately twice that of the planetary orbital period.

For example, we show that several hundred\nGalactic Center supernovae in the last million years plus a diffusion-hardened\nelectron spectrum may be consistent with present constraints on this emission.\nAlternatively, it could be due to a burst of activity probably associated with\nSagittarius A* occurring ~1 Myr ago and producing >10^51 erg in cosmic ray\nelectrons. Different models predict different trends for the spectral index of\nthe microwave and gamma-ray spectrum as a function of angle from the Galactic\nCenter that should be robust to cosmic ray propagation uncertainties.

Abstract: Multistate dark matter (DM) models with small mass splittings and couplings\nto light hidden sector bosons have been proposed as an explanation for the\nPAMELA/Fermi/H.E.S.S. high-energy lepton excesses. We investigate this proposal\nover a wide range of DM density profiles, in the framework of concrete models\nwith doublet or triplet dark matter and a hidden SU(2) gauge sector that mixes\nwith standard model hypercharge. The gauge coupling is bounded from below by\nthe DM relic density, and the Sommerfeld enhancement factor is explicitly\ncomputable for given values of the DM and gauge boson masses M, mu and the\n(largest) dark matter mass splitting delta M_{12}. Sommerfeld enhancement is\nstronger at the galactic center than near the Sun because of the radial\ndependence of the DM velocity profile, which strengthens the inverse Compton\n(IC) gamma ray constraints relative to usual assumptions.

It has earlier been proposed that UHECRs could be\naccelerated in either the nucleus or the outer lobes of the nearby radio galaxy\nCen A. We show that UHECR production at a spatially intermediate location about\n15 kpc northeast from the nucleus, where the jet emerging from the nucleus is\nobserved to strike a large star-forming shell of gas, is a plausible\nalternative. A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud. In this model many CRs arising from\na starburst, with a composition enhanced in heavy elements near the knee region\naround PeV, are boosted to ultra-high energies by the relativistic shock of a\nnewly oriented jet.

The\nkey ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on\nrelatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or\nlarger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a\nconfiguration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to\nsubstantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral\ngrazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic\nencounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the\nphotosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary\nstar increasing its own radius. This is motivated by the case of $\\eta$\nCarinae, where such a collision must have occured if conventional estimates of\nthe present-day orbit are correct, and where brief peaks in the light curve\ncoincide with periastron. Stellar collisions may explain brief recurring LBV\noutbursts like SN 2000ch and SN 2009ip, and perhaps outbursts from relatively\nlow-mass progenitor stars (collisons are not necessarily the exclusive domain\nof very luminous stars). Finally, mass ejections induced repeatedly at\nperiastron cause orbital evolution; this may explain the origin of very\neccentric colliding-wind Wolf-Rayet binaries such as WR140. \n\n"}

We utilize a\nthree-dimensional radiative transfer code, including a hierarchically clumped\nmedium, to study the earliest stages of super star cluster evolution. We\nexplore a range of parameter space in geometric sequences that mimic the\nevolution of an embedded super star cluster. The inclusion of a hierarchically\nclumped medium can make the envelope porous, in accordance with previous models\nand supporting observational evidence. The infrared luminosity inferred from\nobservations can differ by a factor of two from the true value in the clumpiest\nenvelopes depending on the viewing angle.

If the system comprises a massive\nstar and a young non-accreting pulsar, their winds will collide producing\nbroadband non-thermal emission, most likely originated in the shocked pulsar\nwind. Thermal X-ray emission is expected from the shocked stellar wind, but\nuntil now it has neither been detected nor studied in the context of gamma-ray\nbinaries. We present a semi-analytic model of the thermal X-ray emission from\nthe shocked stellar wind in pulsar gamma-ray binaries, and find that the\nthermal X-ray emission increases monotonically with the pulsar spin-down\nluminosity, reaching luminosities of the order of 10^33 erg/s.

The BFJ\nrelation is significantly less scattered than the BTF when the relations are\napplied to their maximum samples, and is not affected by the inclination\nproblems that plague the BTF. Disk-dominated, gas-rich galaxies systematically\ndeviate from the BFJ relation defined by the spheroids.

These calculations are done numerically using high-resolution\nrelativistic hydrodynamical afterglow blast wave simulations which include the\ntwo-dimensional dynamical features of expanding and decelerating afterglow\nblast waves.

This term, for an\n(n+1)-point function, is fixed in terms of the variation of the n-point\nfunction under a special conformal transformation; this parallels the fact that\nthe 1/q^3 term is related with the scale dependence of the n-point function.\nFor the squeezed limit of the 3-point function, this conformal consistency\nrelation implies that there are no terms going as 1/q^2. We verify that the\nsqueezed limit of the 4-point function is related to the conformal variation of\nthe 3-point function both in the case of canonical slow-roll inflation and in\nmodels with reduced speed of sound. In the second case the conformal\nconsistency conditions capture, at the level of observables, the relation among\noperators induced by the non-linear realization of Lorentz invariance in the\nLagrangian.

Abstract: The distribution of QSO radio luminosities has long been debated in the\nliterature. Some argue that it is a bimodal distribution, implying that there\nare two separate QSO populations (normally referred to as 'radio-loud' and\n'radio-quiet'), while others claim it forms a more continuous distribution\ncharacteristic of a single population. We use deep observations at 20 GHz to\ninvestigate whether the distribution is bimodal at high radio frequencies.\nCarrying out this study at high radio frequencies has an advantage over\nprevious studies as the radio emission comes predominantly from the core of the\nAGN, hence probes the most recent activity. Studies carried out at lower\nfrequencies are dominated by the large scale lobes where the emission is built\nup over longer timescales (10^7-10^8 yrs), thereby confusing the sample. Our\nsample comprises 874 X-ray selected QSOs that were observed as part of the 6dF\nGalaxy Survey. Of these, 40% were detected down to a 3 sigma detection limit of\n0.2-0.5 mJy.\n  No evidence of bimodality is seen in either the 20 GHz luminosity\ndistribution or in the distribution of the R_20 parameter: the ratio of the\nradio to optical luminosities traditionally used to classify objects as being\neither radio-loud or radio-quiet. Previous results have claimed that at low\nradio luminosities, star formation processes can dominate the radio emission\nobserved in QSOs. We attempt to investigate these claims by stacking the\nundetected sources at 20 GHz and discuss the limitations in carrying out this\nanalysis. However, if the radio emission was solely due to star formation\nprocesses, we calculate that this corresponds to star formation rates ranging\nfrom ~10 solar masses/yr to ~2300 solar masses/yr. \n\n"}

First, we calculate the evolution of such clouds from the\nprestellar stage until long after protostar formation. Then, we calculate the\npolarization of thermal dust emission expected from the simulation data. We\ncreate polarization maps with arbitrary viewing angles and compare them with\nobservations. Using this procedure, we confirmed that the polarization\ndistribution projected on the celestial plane strongly depends on the viewing\nangle of the cloud. Thus, by comparing the observations with the polarization\nmap predicted by the simulations, we can roughly determine the angle between\nthe direction of the global magnetic field and the line of sight.

Archival ROSAT,\nXMM-Newton and GALEX data are combined with published spectroscopic studies of\nHalpha emission and rotation to obtain a broad picture of stellar activity on M\ndwarfs.

Since\nvertical gravity is neglected in this work, our focus is on how the MRI\nsaturates in the optically thick mid-plane of the disk. We confirm that\nturbulence generated by the MRI is very compressible in the radiation dominated\nregime, as found by previous calculations using the flux-limited diffusion\napproximation. We also find little difference in the saturation properties in\ncalculations that use a larger horizontal domain (up to four times the vertical\nscale height in the radial direction). However, in strongly radiation pressure\ndominated disks (one in which the radiation energy density reaches 1% of the\nrest mass energy density of the gas), we find Maxwell stress from the MRI\nturbulence is larger than the value produced when radiation pressure is\nreplaced with the same amount of gas pressure. At the same time, the ratio\nbetween Maxwell stress and Reynolds stress is increased by almost a factor of 8\ncompared with the gas pressure dominated case. We suggest that this effect is\ncaused by radiation drag, which acts like bulk viscosity and changes the\neffective magnetic Prandtl number of the fluid. Radiation viscosity\nsignificantly exceeds both the microscopic plasma viscosity and resistivity,\nensuring that radiation dominated systems occupy the high magnetic Prandtl\nnumber regime.

A variable f_col that increases by a factor of\n~ 2.0 - 3.5 as the source transitions from the high/soft state to the low/hard\nstate can adequately explain the observed disc spectral evolution.

We find that the unusual lightcurve shapes of PTFO\n8-8695 can be explained by transits of a planet across an oblate,\ngravity-darkened stellar disk. We simultaneously and self-consistently fit two\nseparate lightcurves observed in 2009 December and 2010 December. Our two\nself-consistent fits yield M_p = 3.0 M_Jup and M_p = 3.6 M_Jup for assumed\nstellar masses of M_* = 0.34 M_Sun and M_* = 0.44 M_Sun respectively. The two\nfits have precession periods of 293 days and 581 days. These mass\ndeterminations (consistent with previous upper limits) along with the strength\nof the gravity-darkened precessing model together validate PTFO 8-8695b as just\nthe second Hot Jupiter known to orbit an M-dwarf. Our fits show a high degree\nof spin-orbit misalignment in the PTFO 8-8695 system: 69 +/- 2 or 73.1 +/- 0.5\ndegrees, in the two cases. The large misalignment is consistent with the\nhypothesis that planets become Hot Jupiters with random orbital plane\nalignments early in a system's lifetime. We predict that as a result of the\nhighly misaligned, precessing system, the transits should disappear for months\nat a time over the course of the system's precession period. The precessing,\ngravity-darkened model also predicts other observable effects: changing orbit\ninclination that could be detected by radial velocity observations, changing\nstellar inclination that would manifest as varying v sin i, changing projected\nspin-orbit alignment that could be seen by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect,\nchanging transit shapes over the course of the precession, and differing\nlightcurves as a function of wavelength.

We present new VLBA 15 GHz\nimages of these and 59 additional AGN from the MOJAVE and 2 cm Survey programs.\nNearly all of the 60 most heavily observed jets show significant changes in\ntheir innermost position angle over a 12 to 16 year interval, ranging from 10\ndeg to 150 deg on the sky, corresponding to intrinsic variations of ~0.5 deg to\n~2 deg. The BL Lac jets show smaller variations than quasars. Roughly half of\nthe heavily observed jets show systematic position angle trends with time, and\n20 show indications of oscillatory behavior. The time spans of the data sets\nare too short compared to the fitted periods (5 to 12 y), however, to reliably\nestablish periodicity. The rapid changes and large jumps in position angle seen\nin many cases suggest that the superluminal AGN jet features occupy only a\nportion of the entire jet cross section, and may be energized portions of thin\ninstability structures within the jet.

In\nthese models new flavour violating interactions of ordinary quarks and leptons\nare dominated by a new heavy Z^prime gauge boson with the strength of the\nrelevant couplings governed by four new parameters in the quark sector and the\nparameter beta. We study the implications of these models for beta=+-n/sqrt{3}\nwith n=1,2,3. The case beta=-sqrt{3} leading to Landau singularities for\nM_{Z'}approx 4Tev can be ruled out when the present constraints on Z^prime\ncouplings, in particular from LEP-II, are taken into account. For n=1,2\ninteresting results are found for M_{Z^prime}< 4Tev with largest NP effects for\nbeta<0 in B_d->K^*mu^+mu^- and the ones in B_{s,d}->mu^+mu^- for beta>0. As\nRe(C_9^NP) can reach the values -0.8 and -0.4 for n=2 and n=1, respectively the\nB_d-> K^*mu^+mu^- anomalies can be softened with the size depending on Delta\nM_s/(Delta M_s)_SM and the CP-asymmetry S_{psiphi}. A correlation between\nRe(C_9^NP) and BR(B_s->mu^+mu^-), identified for beta<0, implies for negative\nRe(C_9^NP) uniquely suppression of BR(B_s->mu^+mu^-) relative to its SM value\nwhich is favoured by the data.

Migration can be inward or outward depending on the local\ndisk properties but, in general, only planets more massive than several\n$M_\\oplus$ can migrate outward. Here we propose that an embryo's migration\nhistory determines whether it becomes a hot super-Earth or the core of a giant\nplanet. Systems of hot super-Earths (or mini-Neptunes) form when embryos\nmigrate inward and pile up at the inner edge of the disk. Giant planet cores\nform when inward-migrating embryos become massive enough to switch direction\nand migrate outward. We present simulations of this process using a modified\nN-body code, starting from a swarm of planetary embryos. Systems of hot\nsuper-Earths form in resonant chains with the innermost planet at or interior\nto the disk inner edge. Resonant chains are disrupted by late dynamical\ninstabilities triggered by the dispersal of the gaseous disk. Giant planet\ncores migrate outward toward zero-torque zones, which move inward and\neventually disappear as the disk disperses. Giant planet cores migrate inward\nwith these zones and are stranded at ~1-5 AU. Our model reproduces several\nproperties of the observed extra-solar planet populations. The frequency of\ngiant planet cores increases strongly when the mass in solids is increased,\nconsistent with the observed giant exoplanet - stellar metallicity correlation.\nThe frequency of hot super-Earths is not a function of stellar metallicity,\nalso in agreement with observations. Our simulations can reproduce the broad\ncharacteristics of the observed super-Earth population. \n\n"}

In the analysis of observations of protoplanetary disks the dust phase\nis often assumed to consist of spherical grains, allowing one to apply the Mie\nscattering formalism. However, in reality, the shape of dust grains is expected\nto deviate strongly from that of a sphere. We investigate the influence of\nporous dust grains on the temperature distribution and observable appearance of\nprotoplanetary disks for dust grain porosities of up to 60 %. We performed\nradiative transfer modeling to simulate the temperature distribution, spectral\nenergy distribution, and spatially resolved intensity and polarization maps.\nThe optical properties of porous grains were calculated using the method of\ndiscrete dipole approximation. We find that the flux in the optical wavelength\nrange is for porous grains higher than for compact, spherical grains. The\nprofile of the silicate peak at 9.7 um strongly depends on the degree of grain\nporosity. The temperature distribution shows significant changes in the\ndirection perpendicular to the midplane. Moreover, simulated polarization maps\nreveal an increase of the polarization degree by a factor of about four when\nporous grains are considered, regardless of the disk inclination. The\npolarization direction is reversed in selected disk regions, depending on the\nwavelength, grain porosity, and disk inclination. We discuss several possible\nexplanations of this effect and find that multiple scattering explains the\neffect best. Porosity influences the observable appearance of protoplanetary\ndisks. In particular, the polarization reversal shows a dependence on grain\nporosity. The physical conditions within the disk are altered by porosity,\nwhich might have an effect on the processes of grain growth and disk evolution. \n\n"}

In general, in this\nkind of leading order tunnelling calculations, the exponent arises indeed from\nthe classical action and the pre-factor is an order Planck constant correction.\nBut in the case of emissions of Hawking quanta, the variation of the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy is order 1 for an emitted particle having energy of\norder the Hawking temperature.

The\ndSph models are embedded in dark matter (DM) haloes with either a\ncentrally-divergent 'cusp', or an homogeneous-density 'core'. In agreement with\nprevious studies, we find that as tides strip the galaxy the evolution of the\nhalf-light radius and the averaged velocity dispersion follows well-defined\ntracks that are mainly controlled by the amount of mass lost. Crucially, the\nevolutionary tracks behave differently depending on the shape of the DM\nprofile: at a fixed remnant mass, dSphs embedded in cored haloes have larger\nsizes and higher velocity dispersions than their cuspy counterparts. The\ndivergent evolution is particularly pronounced in galaxies whose stellar\ncomponent is strongly segregated within their DM halo and becomes more\ndisparate as the remnant mass decreases.

Since 2013, T2K has\nbeen accumulating data with a muon antineutrino beam. If the suggested maximal\nCP violation is true, electron-antineutrino appearance would be suppressed.

A resonant bump at a mass of around 750\nGeV in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum is indicated and the corresponding\ndiphoton production cross section is around 3-10 fb. Motivated by the LHC\ndiphoton excess, we propose that the possible resonance candidate is a Higgs\nsinglet. To produce the Higgs singlet via gluon-gluon fusion process, we embed\nthe Higgs singlet in the framework of vector-like triplet quark (VLTQ) model.\nAs a result, the Higgs singlet decaying to diphoton final state is via VLTQ\nloops. Using the enhanced number of new quarks and new Yukawa couplings of the\nVLTQs and Higgs singlet, we successfully explain the diphoton production cross\nsection. We find that the width of the Higgs singlet is below 1 GeV, its\nproduction cross section can be of order of 1 pb at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, and the\nbranching ratio for it decaying to diphoton is around $0.017$ and is\ninsensitive to the masses of VLTQs and new Yukawa couplings.

While rotational mixing\nsignificantly affects the evolution of Cepheid progenitors (intermediate-mass\nstars), the impact of the resulting changes in stellar structure and\ncomposition on Cepheids on their pulsational properties is hitherto unknown.\nHere we present the first detailed pulsational instability analysis of stellar\nevolution models that include the effects of rotation, for both fundamental\nmode and first overtone pulsation. We employ Geneva evolution models spanning a\nthree-dimensional grid in mass (1.7 - 15 $M_\\odot$), metallicity (Z = 0.014,\n0.006, 0.002), and rotation (non-rotating, average & fast rotation).

For slow rotators, we confirm the need for star-disk interactions to\nevolve the ONC to older systems, using h Per (age 13~Myr) as our natural\npost-disk case. Further interactions are not required to evolve slow rotators\nfrom h Per to older systems, implying no justification for extremely long-lived\ndisks as an alternative to core-envelope decoupling. However, our wind models\ncannot evolve rapid rotators from h Per to older systems consistently; this\nappears to be a general problem for any wind model that becomes ineffective in\nlow-mass young stars. We outline two possible solutions: either there is cosmic\nvariance in the distribution of stellar rotation rates in different clusters or\nthere are substantially enhanced torques in low-mass rapid rotators. We favor\nthe former explanation and discuss observational tests that could be used to\ndistinguish them. If the distribution of initial conditions depends on\nenvironment, models which test parameters by assuming a universal underlying\ndistribution of initial conditions will need to be re-evaluated. \n\n"}

Here we determine the physical parameters of the central\nmolecular zone (CMZ) cloud G0.253+0.016, its turbulence, magnetic field and\nfilamentary structure. Using column-density maps based on dust-continuum\nemission observations with ALMA+Herschel, we identify filaments and show that\nat least one dense core is located along them.

A strong velocity gradient is\nseen in the HNCO intensity-weighted velocity maps obtained with ALMA+Mopra,\nwhich is likely caused by large-scale shearing of G0.253+0.016, producing a\nwide double-peaked velocity PDF.

Differences between bulk and brane frames Abstract: Some classes of inflationary models naturally introduce two distinct\nmetrics/frames, and their equivalence in terms of observables has often been\nput in question. D-brane inflation proposes candidates for an inflaton embedded\nin the string theory and possesses descriptions on the brane and bulk\nmetrics/frames, which are connected by a conformal/disformal transformation\nthat depends on the inflaton and its derivatives. It has been shown that\ncurvature perturbations generated by the inflaton are identical in both frames,\nmeaning that observables such as the spectrum of cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) anisotropies are independent of whether matter fields---including those\nin the standard model of particle physics---minimally couple to the brane or\nthe bulk metric/frame. This is true despite the fact that the observables are\neventually measured by the matter fields and that the total action including\nthe matter fields is different in the two cases. In contrast, in curvaton\nscenarios, the observables depend on the frame to which the curvaton minimally\ncouples. Among all inflationary scenarios, we focus on two models motivated by\nthe KKLMMT fine-tuning problem: a slow-roll inflation with an inflection-point\npotential and a model of a rapidly rolling inflaton that conformally couples to\ngravity. In the first model, the difference between the frames in which the\ncurvaton resides is encoded in the spectral index of the curvature\nperturbations, depicting the nature of the frame transformation. In the second\nmodel, the curvaton on the brane induces a spectral index significantly\ndifferent from that in the bulk and is even falsified by the observations. This\nwork thus demonstrates that two frames connected by a conformal/disformal\ntransformation lead to different physical observables such as CMB anisotropies\nin curvaton models. \n\n"}

This prediction provides an observational\ntest of the role of stellar feedback in regulating both stellar and dark-matter\ndensities in dwarf galaxies. We find that Jeans modeling, which treats galaxies\nas virialized systems in dynamical equilibrium, overestimates a galaxy's\ndynamical mass during periods of post-starburst gas outflow and underestimates\nit during periods of net inflow.

The SM matter and Higgs fields propagate from\nthe UV brane down to this intermediate brane only, while gauge and gravity\nfields propagate in the entire bulk. Such a configuration renders the lightest\ngauge Kaluza-Klein (KK) states within LHC reach, simultaneously satisfying\nflavor and CP constraints. In addition, the usual leading decay modes of the\nlightest KK gauge bosons into top and Higgs bosons are suppressed. This effect\npermits erstwhile subdominant channels to become significant. These include\nflavor-universal decays to SM fermions and Higgs bosons, and a novel channel -\ndecay to a radion and a SM gauge boson, followed by radion decay to a pair of\nSM gauge bosons.

At sufficiently high energy, typically\n$\\gtrsim 100$ GeV/n, the ratio of fluxes of the secondary nucleus to that of\nthe main primary nucleus is found to scale as $E_{k}^{-\\delta}$, where $E_{k}$\nis the energy per nucleon (a conserved quantity in spallation reactions) and\n$\\delta$ identifies the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient.

To determine whether small-scale structure today is\nsuppressed on scales below 10 kiloparsecs (corresponding to M < 10^9 M_sun),\none needs to probe CMB-lensing modes out to L ~ 35,000, requiring a CMB\nexperiment with about 20 arcsecond resolution or better. We show that a CMB\nsurvey covering 4,000 square degrees of sky, with an instrumental sensitivity\nof 0.5 uK-arcmin at 18 arcsecond resolution, could distinguish between cold\ndark matter and an alternative, such as 1 keV warm dark matter or 10^(-22) eV\nfuzzy dark matter with about 4-sigma significance. A survey of the same\nresolution with 0.1 uK-arcmin noise could distinguish between cold dark matter\nand these alternatives at better than 20-sigma significance; such\nhigh-significance measurements may also allow one to distinguish between a\nsuppression of power due to either baryonic effects or the particle nature of\ndark matter, since each impacts the shape of the lensing power spectrum\ndifferently. CMB temperature maps yield higher signal-to-noise than\npolarization maps in this small-scale regime; thus, systematic effects, such as\nfrom extragalactic astrophysical foregrounds, need to be carefully considered.\nHowever, these systematic concerns can likely be mitigated with known\ntechniques.

From this constraint, deep insights can\nbe obtained in compact star equation of states, which has been one of the most\npuzzling problems for nuclear physicists and astrophysicists.

As\nan effort to address this problem, we here explore possible roles of Alfv\\'en\nwaves self-excited via resonant streaming instability during the CR\nacceleration at parallel shocks. The mean drift of Alfv\\'en waves may either\nincrease or decrease the scattering center compression ratio, depending on the\npostshock cross-helicity, leading to either flatter or steeper CR spectra. We\nfirst examine such effects at planar shocks, based on the transport of Alfv\\'en\nwaves in the small amplitude limit. For the shock parameters relevant to\ncluster shocks, Alfv\\'enic drift flattens the CR spectrum slightly, resulting\nin a small increase of the CR acceleration efficiency, $\\eta$. We then consider\ntwo additional, physically motivated cases: (1) postshock waves are isotropized\nvia MHD and plasma processes across the shock transition and (2) postshock\nwaves contain only forward waves propagating along with the flow due to a\npossible gradient of CR pressure behind the shock. In these cases, Alfv\\'enic\ndrift could reduce $\\eta$ by as much as a factor of 5 for weak cluster shocks.\nFor the canonical parameters adopted here, we suggest $\\eta\\sim10^{-4}-10^{-2}$\nfor shocks with sonic Mach number $M_{\\rm s}\\approx2-3$.

It is thus\ndesirable that a new, analytic model would instead become available for\nvirialized dark halos. One promising candidate is probably the empirical\ndensity profile proposed by Burkert, which resembles an isothermal profile with\na constant core in the inner region and matches the NFW profile at large radii.\nMeanwhile, such a revised dark halo (RDH) profile has turned out a great\nsuccess on galactic scales. This stimulates us to apply the RDH profile to more\nmassive systems like clusters of galaxies. In this paper we have made an\nattempt to derive the radial density profile of intracluster gas from the RDH\nprofile, and compare it with those revealed by X-ray observations and inferred\nfrom the NFW profile. It is shown that the RDH predicted gas density can be\nwell represented by the conventional beta model with a typical beta parameter\nof 0.7-0.9.

The reason of this\nfailure is a misunderstanding of the spectroscopy of hydrogen crossed by a\npowerful beam of short wavelengths light. Except very close to the surface,\nhydrogen is mostly heated by a Lyman absorption improved by a parametric\nfrequency shift due to excited atomic hydrogen, so that this absorption\nstabilises the temperature between the limits of ionisation and dimerisation. A\npowerful radio emission may produce an extra ionisation where the pressure is\nconvenient. The combination of Lyman absorptions and redshifts produces an\ninstability which chains Lyman absorption patterns : when a redshifted Lyman\nabsorbed line coincides with a Lyman line, all absorption lines of the gas are\nwritten into the spectrum.

Both clusters are extremely massive, being more than three times heavier\nthan the most massive globular clusters in the Galaxy. For both clusters we\nmeasure light-to-mass ratios, which when compared to simple stellar population\n(SSP) models of the appropriate age, are consistent with a Kroupa-type stellar\nmass function. Using measurements from the literature we find a strong age\ndependence on how well SSP models (with underlying Kroupa or Salpeter-type\nstellar mass functions) fit the light-to-mass ratio of clusters. Based on this\nresult we suggest that the large scatter in the light-to-mass ratio of the\nyoungest clusters is not due to variations in the underlying stellar mass\nfunction, but instead to the rapidly changing internal dynamics of young\nclusters. Finally, based on the positions of old globular clusters, young\nmassive clusters (YMCs), ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) and dwarf-globular\ntransition objects (DGTOs) in kappa-space we conclude that 1) UCDs and DGTOs\nare consistent with the high mass end of star clusters and 2) YMCs occupy a\nmuch larger parameter space than old globular clusters, consistent with the\nidea of preferential disruption of star clusters.

There is a clear excess of QSOs near the minor axis with respect to\nthe major axis of nearby edge-on spiral galaxies, significant at a level\n3.5-sigma up to angular distances of 3 deg.

The\n3-11 keV spectrum is well fitted by a power-law of slope 2.43. We detect a weak\n(equivalent width ~80 eV) emission line at ~6.7 keV, which implies emission\nfrom ionized iron. There is no compelling evidence for significant broadening\nof the line.We also detect a possible Doppler shifted absorption line at 8.1\nkeV. At energies lower than 2 keV, the spectrum is dominated by a smooth soft\nexcess component which can be well fitted either by a two black body components\n(kT~0.15 and 0.07 keV) or by a black body plus a relativistically blurred\nphotoionized disc reflection model.

In essence, an optimal reconstruction algorithm\nis applied to the continuum band (2-4keV) light curve which smoothes out noise\nand interpolates across the data gaps. The reconstructed continuum band light\ncurve can then be folded through trial transfer functions in an attempt to find\nlags or leads between the continuum band and the iron line band (5-7keV). We\nfind reduced fractional variability in the line band. The spectral analysis of\nLee et al. (1999) reveals this to be due to a combination of an apparently\nconstant iron line flux (at least on timescales of few x 10^4s), and flux\ncorrelated changes in the photon index. We also find no evidence for iron line\nreverberation and exclude reverberation delays in the range 0.5-50ksec. This\nextends the conclusions of Lee et al. and suggests that the iron line flux\nremains constant on timescales as short as 0.5ksec. The large black hole mass\n(>10^8Msun) naively suggested by the constancy of the iron line flux is\nrejected on other grounds. We suggest that the black hole in MCG-6-30-15 has a\nmass of M_BH~10^6-10^7Msun and that changes in the ionization state of the disk\nmay produce the puzzling spectral variability. Finally, it is found that the\n8-15keV band lags the 2-4keV band by 50-100s.
