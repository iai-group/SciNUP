The effect is responsible for a wealth of non-equilibrium\nphenomena, and has been exploited to transmit quantum information through spin\nchains. It is a commonly expressed belief that for local Hamiltonians, any such\npropagation happens at a finite \"speed of sound\". Indeed, the Lieb-Robinson\ntheorem states that in spin models, all effects caused by a perturbation are\nlimited to a causal cone defined by a constant speed, up to exponentially small\ncorrections. In this work we show that for translationally invariant bosonic\nmodels with nearest-neighbor interactions, this belief is incorrect: We prove\nthat one can encounter excitations which accelerate under the natural dynamics\nof the lattice and allow for reliable transmission of information faster than\nany finite speed of sound.

For a\nqubit undergoing unitary decoherence the evolution of a qubit state in the\npresence of time-varying semiclassical fields may be treated geometrically. We\nshow that the fidelity of an arbitrary control operation may then be expressed\nto arbitrary order in terms of experimentally relevant spectral characteristics\nof the noise and the control over all Cartesian directions and accounting for\nnoise cross-correlations. We formulate \\emph{control matrices} in the time\ndomain to capture the effects of piecewise-constant control, and convert them\nto generalized Fourier-domain filter functions.

We focus on one-dimensional realizations of the Majorana code,\nas well as networks of such structures, and investigate their lifetime when\ncoupled to a parity-preserving thermal environment.

Abstract: On the surface of 2D Topological insulators occur 1D quantum spin Hall(QSH)\nedge modes with Dirac like dispersion. Unlike quantum Hall(QH) edge modes which\noccur at high magnetic fields in 2DEGs, the occurrence of QSH edge modes is\nbecause of spin-orbit scattering in the bulk of the material. These QSH edge\nmodes are spin dependent and chiral- opposite spins move in opposing\ndirections. Electronic spin has larger decoherence and relaxation time than\ncharge- in view of this its expected that QSH edge modes will be more robust to\ndisorder and inelastic scattering than QH edge modes which are charge dependent\nand spin unpolarized. However, we notice no such advantage accrues to QSH edge\nmodes when subjected to same degree of contact disorder and/or inelastic\nscattering in similar setups as QH edge modes. In fact we observe that QSH edge\nmodes are more susceptible to inelastic scattering and contact disorder than QH\nedge modes. Further, while a single disordered contact has no effect on QH edge\nmodes it leads to a finite charge Hall current in case of quantum spin Hall\nedge modes and thus vanishing of pure quantum spin Hall effect. For more than a\nsingle disordered contact while quantum Hall states continue to remain immune\nto disorder, quantum spin Hall edge modes become more susceptible- the Hall\nresistance for quantum spin Hall effect changes sign with increasing disorder.\nIn case of many disordered contacts with inelastic scattering included while\nquantization of Hall edge modes holds, for quantum spin Hall edge modes- a\nfinite charge Hall current still flows. For quantum spin Hall edge modes in the\ninelastic scattering regime we distinguish between two cases: with spin-flip\nand without spin-flip scattering. Finally, while asymmetry in sample geometry\ncan have a deleterious effect on quantum spin Hall case it has no impact in\nquantum Hall case. \n\n"}

At the intersection of these two phenomena, we devise a simple\nscheme for generating various types of nuclear spin cat states. The native\nbiaxial electric quadrupole interaction that is readily available in strained\nsolid-state systems plays a key role here. However, the fact that built-in\nstrain cannot be switched off poses a challenge for the stabilization of target\ncat states once they are prepared.

The celebrated quantum Rabi model describes the simplest\ninteraction of a two-level system with a single-mode boson field. When the\ncoupling is large enough, the bare multilevel structure of a realistic circuit\natom cannot be ignored even if the circuit is strongly anharmonic. We explored\nthis situation theoretically for flux (fluxonium) and charge (Cooper pair box)\ntype multi-level circuits tuned to their respective flux/charge degeneracy\npoints. We identified which spectral features of the quantum Rabi model survive\nand which are renormalized for large coupling. Despite significant\nrenormalization of the low-energy spectrum in the fluxonium case, the key\nquantum Rabi feature -- nearly-degenerate vacuum consisting of an atomic state\nentangled with a multi-photon field -- appears in both types of circuits when\nthe coupling is sufficiently large.

Although spin-based quantum circuits based on\nshort-range exchange interactions are possible, the development of scalable,\nlonger-range coupling schemes constitutes a critical challenge within the\nspin-qubit community. Approaches based on capacitative coupling and\ncavity-mediated interactions effectively couple spin qubits to the charge\ndegree of freedom, making them susceptible to electrically-induced decoherence.\nThe alternative is to extend the range of the Heisenberg exchange interaction\nby means of a quantum mediator. Here, we show that a multielectron quantum dot\nwith 50-100 electrons serves as an excellent mediator, preserving speed and\ncoherence of the resulting spin-spin coupling while providing several\nfunctionalities that are of practical importance. These include speed (mediated\ntwo-qubit rates up to several gigahertz), distance (of order of a micrometer),\nvoltage control, possibility of sweet spot operation (reducing susceptibility\nto charge noise), and reversal of the interaction sign (useful for dynamical\ndecoupling from noise). \n\n"}

We show that (1) the partial spatial separation of the wave\nfunctions of the component Majorana bound states (MBSs) is crucial for the\ncreation and stability of topologically trivial near-zero-energy Andreev bound\nstates, (2) the signs of the spin polarizations of the component MBSs can be\neither the same or opposite, depending on the profile of the inducing\npotential, and (3) the spin polarizations do not play a fundamental role in\ngenerating vastly different coupling strengths to local probes and/or ensuring\nthe robustness of the near-zero-energy ABS.

Current can flow only if two charge states of the grain have the same\nenergy; in this case the conductance has a peak. In a small grain with\nquantized electron states, referred to as a quantum dot, the magnitude of the\nconductance peak is directly related to the magnitude of the wavefunction near\nthe contacts to the dot. Since dots are generally irregular in shape, the\ndynamics of the electrons is chaotic, and the characteristics of Coulomb\nblockade peaks reflects those of wavefunctions in chaotic systems. Previously,\na statistical theory for the peaks was derived by assuming these wavefunctions\nto be completely random.
