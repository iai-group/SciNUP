Hence, in particular, it follows that the DAMA/NaI\nobservations in Gran Sasso of the annual modulation of the signal frequency in\na narrow range of scintillations with an amplitude of 2-6 keV electron\nequivalent may be due to incidence onto the Earth of exceedingly massive\nparticles (of the type of Planckian objects) from elongated Earth-crossing\nheliocentric orbits at a velocity of 30-50 km/s.

The addition of an accelerometer on board a spacecraft provides\norbit determination specialists and physicists with an additional observable of\ngreat interest: it measures the value of the non-gravitational acceleration\nacting on the spacecraft, i.e. the departure of the probe from geodesic motion.\nThis technology is now routinely used for geodesy missions in Earth orbits with\nelectrostatic accelerometers. This article proposes a technological evolution\nwhich consists in adding a subsystem to remove the bias of an electrostatic\naccelerometer. It aims at enhancing the scientific return of interplanetary\nmissions in the Solar System, from the point of view of fundamental physics as\nwell as Solar System physics. The main part of the instrument is an\nelectrostatic accelerometer called MicroSTAR, which inherits mature\ntechnologies based on Onera's experience in the field of accelerometry. This\naccelerometer is mounted on a rotating stage, called Bias Rejection System,\nwhich modulates the non-gravitational acceleration and thus permits to remove\nthe bias of the instrument from the signal of interest. This article presents\nthe motivations of this study, describes the instrument, called GAP, and the\nmeasurement principle, and discusses the performance of the instrument as well\nas integration constraints. Within a mass of 3.1 kg and an average consumption\nof 3 W, it is possible to reach a precision of 1 pm s$^{-2}$ for the\nacceleration measured with an integration time of five hours. Combining this\nobservable with the radio tracking data, it is therefore possible to compare\nthe motion of the spacecraft to theoretical predictions with a precision\nimproved by at least three orders of magnitude with respect to existing\ntechniques. \n\n"}

If gauge parameters propagate\nin the bulk, the excited Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes are gauge fields and the four\ndimensional theory is gauge invariant only if the compactification is carried\nout by using curvatures as fundamental objects.

These measurements are necessary to determine the\nabsolute cross-sections of reaction processes and are valuable to quantify the\nperformance of the accelerator. Using data taken in 2010, LHCb has applied two\nmethods to determine the absolute scale of its luminosity measurements for\nproton-proton collisions at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. In\naddition to the classic \"van der Meer scan\" method a novel technique has been\ndeveloped which makes use of direct imaging of the individual beams using\nbeam-gas and beam-beam interactions. This beam imaging method is made possible\nby the high resolution of the LHCb vertex detector and the close proximity of\nthe detector to the beams, and allows beam parameters such as positions, angles\nand widths to be determined. The results of the two methods have comparable\nprecision and are in good agreement. Combining the two methods, an overall\nprecision of 3.5% in the absolute luminosity determination is reached. The\ntechniques used to transport the absolute luminosity calibration to the full\n2010 data-taking period are presented. \n\n"}

As in the case of hierarchy determination, there exist\nfavorable (unfavorable) values of deltacp for which octant resolution is easy\n(challenging). However, for octant resolution the unfavorable deltacp values of\nthe neutrino data are favorable for the anti-neutrino data and vice-verse.

Their\nuse for track fitting shows a drastic improvements of a factor two, for the low\nnoise case, and a factor three, for the high noise case, respect to the\nstandard approach. The tracks are well reconstructed even in presence of hits\nwith large errors, with a surprising effect of hit discarding. The applications\nillustrated are simulations of the PAMELA tracker, but other type of trackers\ncan be handled similarly. The probability distributions are calculated for the\ncenter of gravity algorithms, and they are very different from gaussian\nprobabilities. These differences are crucial to accurately reconstruct tracks\nwith high error hits and to produce the effective discarding of the too noisy\nhits (outliers). The similarity of our distributions with the Cauchy\ndistribution forced us to abandon the standard deviation for our comparisons\nand instead use the full width at half maximum.

We report on high-precision timing solutions which utilise\nhigh-bandwidth preamplifiers and fast discriminators providing\nTime-over-Threshold information, which can be used for charge measurements or\nwalk corrections thus improving the obtainable timing resolution. The output\nsignal are LVDS and can be directly fed into a multi-hit TDC readout. The\nperformance of the electronics was investigated for single photon signals,\ntypical for imaging Cherenkov detectors. The opposite condition of light\nsignals arising from plastic scintillators, was also studied. High counting\nrates per channel of several MHz were achieved, and a timing resolution of\nbetter than 100 ps could be obtained in a test experiment using the full\nreadout chain. \n\n"}

Importantly, even a thin (mono) layer of a low-loss dielectric can\nenhance the noise level by several orders of magnitude compared to the noise\nabove a bare metal.

With the availability of powerful digital signal processing\ntechniques, new attempts at measuring cosmic ray air showers via their radio\nemission were started at the beginning of the new millennium. Starting with\nmodest, small-scale digital prototype setups, the field has evolved, matured\nand grown very significantly in the past decade. Today's second-generation\ndigital radio detection experiments consist of up to hundreds of radio antennas\nor cover areas of up to 17 km$^{2}$. We understand the physics of the radio\nemission in extensive air showers in detail and have developed analysis\nstrategies to accurately derive from radio signals parameters which are related\nto the astrophysics of the primary cosmic ray particles, in particular their\nenergy, arrival direction and estimators for their mass. In parallel to these\nsuccesses, limitations inherent in the physics of the radio signals have also\nbecome increasingly clear. In this article, we review the progress of the past\ndecade and the current state of the field, discuss the current paradigm of the\nradio emission physics and present the experimental evidence supporting it.\nFinally, we discuss the potential for future applications of the radio\ndetection technique to advance the field of cosmic ray physics. \n\n"}

Drag-free technology is one of the\ntechnologies that is fundamental for LISA-Pathfinder, an ESA mission whose\nlaunch is planned for the end of September 2015. A purely drag-free object is\ndefined by the absence of all external forces other than gravity. This is not a\nnatural condition and thus requires a proper design of a spacecraft, whose core\nis an object in free-fall, called test mass (TM). The purity of the drag-free\norbit depends on the spacecraft capability of protecting the TM from\ndisturbances, which indeed has limitations. According to a NASA study, such a\nconcept provides substantial economies for LEO satellites. At the same time, a\ndrag-free motion is required in many missions of fundamental physics. eLISA is\nan ESA concept mission aimed at opening a new window to the universe, black\nholes, and massive binary systems by means of gravitational waves.\nLISA-Pathfinder is in charge of proving the eLISA concept.

To understand what is going\non in the dimensional regularization, we illustrate how to reproduce the\nresults of the dimensional regularization for the $\\lambda\\phi^{4}$ theory in\nthe more conventional regularization such as the higher derivative\nregularization; the basic postulate involved is that the quadratically\ndivergent induced mass, which is independent of the scale change of the\nphysical mass, is kinematical and unphysical. This is consistent with the\nderivation of the Callan-Symanzik equation, which is a comparison of two\ntheories with slightly different masses, for the $\\lambda\\phi^{4}$ theory\nwithout encountering the quadratic divergence. We thus suggest that the\ndimensional regularization is generic in a bottom-up approach starting with a\nsuccessful low-energy theory. We also define a modified version of the mass\nindependent renormalization for a scalar field which leads to the homogeneous\nrenormalization group equation. Implications of the present analysis on the\nStandard Model at high energies and the presence or absence of SUSY at LHC\nenergies are briefly discussed. \n\n"}

While these implementations are\npotentially scalable, true scalability will require systems engineering to\ncombine quantum and classical hardware. One technology demanding imminent\nefforts is the realization of a suitable wiring method for the control and\nmeasurement of a large number of qubits. In this work, we introduce an\ninterconnect solution for solid-state qubits: The quantum socket.

The creation mechanism makes the vector bosons' energy spectral\ndensity $\\rho_{cdm}/\\Delta E$ very high. Therefore, the dark electric dipole\ntransition rate in atoms is boosted if the energy gap between atomic states\nequals the mass of the vector bosons. By using the Zeeman effect, the energy\ngap between the 2S state and the 2P state in hydrogen atoms or hydrogen like\nions can be tuned. The $2S$ state can be populated with electrons due to its\nrelatively long life, which is about $1/7$s. When the energy gap between the\nsemi-ground $2S$ state and the 2P state matches the mass of the cosmic vector\nbosons, induced transitions occur and the 2P state subsequently decays into the\n1S state. The $2P\\to1S$ decay emitted Lyman-$\\alpha$ photons can then be\nregistered. The choices of target atoms depend on the experimental facilities\nand the mass ranges of the vector bosons. Because the mass of the vector boson\nis connected to the inflation scale, the proposed experiment may provide a\nprobe to inflation. \n\n"}

The up-quark mass is spontaneously generated by the\nneutrino condensate which plays the role of an additional composite Higgs\ndoublet with the compositeness scale of the order of the neutrino masses. Such\na scenario is highly economical: it solves the strong $CP$ problem, generates\nthe up-quark and neutrino masses from fermion condensates and simultaneously\nprotects the axion shift symmetry against gravitational anomaly. The\nphenomenology is different from the standard hidden axion case. One of the\nexperimental signatures is the existence of a gravity-competing\nisotope-dependent attractive force among nucleons at (sub)micron distances. \n\n"}

The nine\nzero entries can only be distributed between the up- and down-quark sectors in\nmatrix pairs with six and three texture zeroes or five and four texture zeroes.\nIn the weak basis where a quark mass matrix is nonsingular and has six zeroes\nin one sector, we find that there are 54 matrices with three zeroes in the\nother sector, obtainable through right-handed weak basis transformations.

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are\nused to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of\nthe morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification\nmethods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency\nand accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and\ncharacterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and\nsubsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby\nimproving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We\ndemonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first\nobserving run. \n\n"}

Important examples are the total transverse momentum $q_T$ in\ncolor-singlet production, N-jettiness (with thrust or beam thrust as special\ncases), but also jet mass and more complicated jet substructure observables.\nThe all-order logarithmic structure of such distributions is often fully\nencoded in differential equations, so-called (renormalization group) evolution\nequations. We introduce a well-defined technique of distributional scale\nsetting, which allows one to treat logarithmic plus distributions like ordinary\nlogarithms when solving these differential equations. In particular, this\nallows one (through canonical scale choices) to minimize logarithmic\ncontributions in the boundary terms of the solution, and to obtain the full\ndistributional logarithmic structure from the solution's evolution kernel\ndirectly in distribution space. We apply this technique to the $q_T$\ndistribution, where the two-dimensional nature of convolutions leads to\nadditional difficulties (compared to one-dimensional cases like thrust), and\nfor which the resummation in distribution (or momentum) space has been a\nlong-standing open question.

The high density of hits on a given particle track facilitates the task\nof pattern recognition in a high-occupancy environment and in addition provides\nparticle identification by measuring the specific energy loss for each track.\nFor these reasons, TPCs with Multiwire Proportional Chamber (MWPC)\namplification have been and are widely used in experiments recording heavy-ion\ncollisions. A significant drawback, however, is the large dead time of the\norder of 1 ms per event generated by the use of a gating grid, which is\nmandatory to prevent ions created in the amplification region from drifting\nback into the drift volume, where they would severely distort the drift path of\nsubsequent tracks. For experiments with higher event rates this concept of a\nconventional TPC operating with a triggered gating grid can therefore not be\napplied without a significant loss of data. A continuous readout of the signals\nis the more appropriate way of operation. This, however, constitutes a change\nof paradigm with considerable challenges to be met concerning the amplification\nregion, the design and bandwidth of the readout electronics, and the data\nhandling. A mandatory prerequisite for such an operation is a sufficiently good\nsuppression of the ion backflow from the avalanche region, which otherwise\nlimits the tracking and particle identification capabilities of such a\ndetector. Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) are a promising candidate to combine\nexcellent spatial resolution with an intrinsic suppression of ions. In this\npaper we describe the design, construction and the commissioning of a large TPC\nwith GEM amplification and without gating grid (GEM-TPC). \n\n"}

It includes an interface for expressing complex\ndata reduction pipelines consisting of both data sets and algorithmic\ncomponents and an implementation run-time to execute such pipelines on\ndistributed resources.

We motivate use of this technique,\ndescribe a tuning of the underlying phenomenological formula, quantify its\nperformance on fully contained beam-neutrino-induced muon tracks both in\nsimulation and in data, and quantify its performance on exiting muon tracks in\nsimulation. Using simulation, we have shown that the standard Highland formula\nshould be re-tuned specifically for scattering in liquid argon, which\nsignificantly improves the bias and resolution of the momentum measurement.\nWith the tuned formula, we find agreement between data and simulation for\ncontained tracks, with a small bias in the momentum reconstruction and with\nresolutions that vary as a function of track length, improving from about 10%\nfor the shortest (one meter long) tracks to 5% for longer (several meter)\ntracks.

A Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector delivers sensitivity to\nlow-energy gamma-rays such as those emitted by 210Pb and 234Th. A Small Anode\nGermanium (SAGe) well-type detector is employed for efficient screening of\nsmall samples. Finally, a standard p-type coaxial detector provides fast\nscreening of standard samples. This paper presents the steps used to\ncharacterise the performance of these detectors for a variety of sample\ngeometries, including the corrections applied to account for cascade summing\neffects. For low-density materials, BUGS is able to radio-assay to specific\nactivities down to 3.6 mBq/kg for 234Th and 6.6 mBq/kg for 210Pb both of which\nhave uncovered some significant equilibrium breaks in the 238U chain. In denser\nmaterials, where gamma-ray self-absorption increases, sensitivity is\ndemonstrated to specific activities of 0.9 mBq/kg for 226Ra, 1.1 mBq/kg for 228\nRa, 0.3 mBq/kg for 224Ra, and 8.6 mBq/kg for 40K with all upper limits at a 90%\nconfidence level. These meet the requirements of most screening campaigns\npresently under way for rare-event search experiments, such as the LUX-ZEPLIN\n(LZ) dark matter experiment. We also highlight the ability of the BEGe detector\nto probe the X-ray fluorescence region which can be important to identify the\npresence of radioisotopes associated with neutron production; this is of\nparticular relevance in experiments sensitive to nuclear recoils. \n\n"}

We derive the stability conditions for two-frequency operation\nfrom asymptotic properties of the solutions of the Mathieu equation and give a\ngeneral treatment of the effect of damping on parametric resonances.\nTwo-frequency operation is effective when the two species' mass ratios and\ncharge ratios are sufficiently large, and further when the frequencies required\nto optimally trap each species are widely separated. This system resembles two\ncoincident Paul traps, each operating close to a frequency optimized for one of\nthe species, such that both species are tightly confined.

Until\nrecently, it was believed that proportional electroluminescence was fully due\nto VUV emission of noble gas excimers produced in atomic collisions with\nexcited atoms, the latter being in turn produced by drifting electrons.

Here we propose a\nnew proof of concept experiment aiming for an accuracy of 100 ppm to be able to\ntest the second-order correction in the calculations, which is $\\simeq\n45\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}\\right)^2\\approx 200$ ppm. The improvement relies on\na new technique to confine the o-Ps in a vacuum cavity. Moreover, a new method\nwas developed to subtract the time dependent pick-off annihilation rate of the\nfast backscattered positronium from the o-Ps decay rate prior to fitting the\ndistribution. Therefore, this measurement will be free from the systematic\nerrors present in the previous experiments. The same experimental setup\ndeveloped for our recent search for invisible decay of ortho-positronium is\nbeing used.

Substantial increases of\nmomentum resolution respect to standard fit is obtained. The key point is the\nuse of a realistic probability distribution for each hit (heteroscedasticity).\nTwo different methods are used for the fits, the first method introduces an\neffective variance for each hit, the second method implements the maximum\nlikelihood search. The tracker model is similar to the PAMELA tracker. Each\nside, of the two sided of the PAMELA detectors, is simulated as momentum\nreconstruction device. One of the two is similar to silicon micro-strip\ndetectors of large use in running experiments. Two different position\nreconstructions are used for the standard fits, the $\\eta$-algorithm (the best\none) and the two-strip center of gravity. The gain obtained in momentum\nresolution is measured as the virtual magnetic field and the virtual\nsignal-to-noise ratio required by the two standard fits to reach an overlap\nwith the best of two new methods.

As atomic transition frequencies depend on the\namplitude of this field, many experiments require a stable absolute field. Most\nsetups use electromagnets, which require a power supply stability not usually\nmet by commercially available units. We demonstrate stabilization of a field of\n14.6 mT to 4.3 nT rms noise (0.29 ppm), compared to noise of $\\gtrsim$ 100 nT\nwithout any stabilization.

We first measure the optical response of the array with a\nbeam mapping system to link all resonances to their physical resonators. Then a\nnew set of resonance frequencies with uniform spacing and higher multiplexing\nfactor is designed. We use simulations to deduce the lengths that we should\ntrim from the capacitor fingers in order to shift the resonances to the desired\nfrequencies. The sample is then modified using contact lithography and\nre-measured using the same setup. We demonstrate this technique on a 112-pixel\naluminum lumped-element kinetic-inductance detector array.

Field-trapping mitigates\nthe problem of UCN loss on material surfaces, which caused the largest\ncorrection in prior neutron experiments using material bottles. However, the\nneutron dynamics in field traps differ qualitatively from those in material\nbottles. In the latter case, neutrons bounce off material surfaces with\nsignificant diffusivity and the population quickly reaches a static spatial\ndistribution with a density gradient induced by the gravitational potential. In\ncontrast, the field-confined UCN -- whose dynamics can be described by\nHamiltonian mechanics -- do not exhibit the stochastic behaviors typical of an\nideal gas model as observed in material bottles. In this report, we will\ndescribe our efforts to simulate UCN trapping in the UCN{\\tau}\nmagneto-gravitational trap.

These theories have\nequivalent 4D dual descriptions, in which the electroweak symmetry is\ndynamically broken by non-trivial infrared dynamics of some gauge interaction,\nwhose coupling g and size N satisfy g^2N > 16pi^2. Such theories allow one to\ncalculate electroweak radiative corrections, including the oblique parameters\nS, T and U, as long as g^2N/16pi^2 and N are large. We study how the duality\nbetween the 4D and 5D theories manifests itself in the computation of various\nphysical quantities. In particular, we study a warped 5D theory where the\nelectroweak symmetry is broken by boundary conditions at the infrared brane. We\nshow that S exceeds the experimental bound if the minimal theory is in a weakly\ncoupled regime. This requires either an extension of the model or departure\nfrom weak coupling.

Unfortunately, AM noise is taken in through\nthe power-to-dc-offset conversion mechanism that results from the mixer\nasymmetry. The measurement of some mixers indicates that the unwanted\namplitude-to-voltage gain is of the order of 5-50 mV, which is 12-35 dB lower\nthan the phase-to-voltage gain of the mixer. In addition, the trick of setting\nthe mixer at a sweet point -- off the quadrature condition -- where the\nsensitivity to AM nulls, works only with microwave mixers. The HF-VHF mixers\nhave not this sweet point. Moreover, we prove that if the AM noise comes from\nthe oscillator under test, it can not be rejected by correlation. At least not\nwith the schemes currently used. An example shows that at some critical\nfrequencies the unwanted effect of AM noise is of the same order -- if not\ngreater -- than the phase noise. Thus, experimental mistakes are around the\ncorner. \n\n"}

Small\nliquid scintillator detectors have already demonstrated sensitivity to\noperational power levels, but more sensitive monitoring requires improvements\nin the efficiency and uniformity of these detectors. In this work, we use a\nmontecarlo simulation to investigate the detector performance of four different\ndetector configurations. Based on the analysis of neutron detection efficiency\nand positron energy response, we find that the optimal detector design will\ndepend on the goals and restrictions of the specific installation or\napplication. We have attempted to present the relevant information so that\nfuture detector development can proceed in a profitable direction. \n\n"}

At\nsmallest incidence angles the capture probability reaches 99 percent. A pair of\ncrystals with cuts bent in orthogonal planes allows to reach a 99.9 percent\nefficiency of single-pass deflection of a proton beam with an ultra small\ndivergence. Conditions necessary for efficient single-pass deflection of\nprotons from the LHC beam halo are discussed. \n\n"}

{"id": "physics/9906063", "contents": "Title: Physics of Particle Detection Abstract: In this review the basic interaction mechanisms of charged and neutral\nparticles are presented. The ionization energy loss of charged particles is\nfundamental to most particle detectors and is therefore described in more\ndetail. The production of electromagnetic radiation in various spectral ranges\nleads to the detection of charged particles in scintillation, Cherenkov and\ntransition radiation counters. Photons are measured via the photoelectric\neffect, Compton scattering or pair production, and neutrons through their\nnuclear interactions. A combination of the various detector methods helps to\nidentify elementary particles and nuclei. At high energies absorption\ntechniques in calorimeters provide additional particle identification and an\naccurate energy measurement. \n\n"}
