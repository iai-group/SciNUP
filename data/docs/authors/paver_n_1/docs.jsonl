One\nis the \\mu-/B \\mu-problem and the second is the cosmological one. The former\nstems from the fact that the B parameter tends to be comparable with the\ngravitino mass, which is two order of magnitude larger than the other soft\nmasses. The latter problem is caused by the decay of the modulus whose\nbranching ratio into the gravitino pair is sizable. In this paper, we propose a\nmodel of mirage mediation, in which Peccei-Quinn symmetry is incorporated. In\nthis axionic mirage mediation, it is shown that the PQ symmetry breaking scale\nis dynamically determined around 10^{10-12} GeV due to the supersymmetry\nbreaking effects, and the \\mu-problem can be solved naturally. Furthermore, in\nour model, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is the axino, that is the\nsuperpartner of the axion. The overabundance of the LSPs due to decays of\nmodulus/gravitino, which is the most serious cosmological difficulty in the\nmirage mediation, can be avoided if the axino is sufficiently light. The\nnext-LSPs (NLSPs) produced by the gravitino decay eventually decay into the\naxino LSPs, yielding the dominant component of the axinos remaining today.

The viability of the\nscenario hinges on the interplay between various components of the axion\nsupermultiplet, which in F-theory GUTs is also responsible for breaking\nsupersymmetry. In these models, the gravitino is the LSP and develops a mass by\neating the axino mode. The radial component of the axion supermultiplet known\nas the saxion typically begins to oscillate in the early Universe, eventually\ncoming to dominate the energy density. Its decay reheats the Universe to a\ntemperature of ~ 1 GeV, igniting BBN and diluting all thermal relics such as\nthe gravitino by a factor of ~ 10^(-4) - 10^(-5) such that gravitinos\ncontribute a sizable component of the dark matter. In certain cases,\nnon-thermally produced relics such as the axion, or gravitinos generated from\nthe decay of the saxion can also contribute to the abundance of dark matter.\nRemarkably enough, this cosmological scenario turns out to be independent of\nthe initial reheating temperature of the Universe.

Moreover, in some instances when the\ntransverse polarisation tensor of highest rank is vanishing, for an accidental\nor dynamical reason, the standard azimuthal asymmetries vanish and would lead\nto a measurement with a wrong spin assignment. In a frame such as the one we\nconstruct, the correct spin assignment would however still be possible. The\nmethod gives direct information about the spin of the particle under\nconsideration and the same event sample can be used to identify the spins of\neach particle in a decay chain. A drawback of the method is that it is\ninstrumental only when the momenta of the test particle can be reconstructed.\nHowever we hope that it might still be of use in situations with only partial\nreconstruction. We also derive the conditions on the production and decay\nmechanisms for the spins, and hence the polarisations, to be measured at a\ncollider experiment. As an example for the use of the method we consider the\nsimultaneous reconstruction, at the partonic level, of the spin of both the top\nand the $W$ in top pair production in $e^+ e^-$ in the semi-leptonic channel. \n\n"}

The action involves a positive power of a\ncharacteristic mass parameter, M, whose value can be, interestingly enough, of\nthe order of a typical particle physics mass of the Standard Model of the\nstrong and electroweak interactions or extensions thereof, including the\nneutrino mass. The model universe emerging from this scenario (the \"Relaxed\nUniverse\") falls within the class of the so-called LXCDM models of the cosmic\nevolution.

One\nspecific complication arises from derivative interactions induced by the\ncurvilinear trajectory of the inflaton in a multi-dimensional field space. In\nthis work we compute the power spectrum in general multi-field models and show\nthat certain inflaton trajectories may lead to observationally significant\nimprints of `heavy' physics in the primordial power spectrum if the inflaton\ntrajectory turns, that is, traverses a bend, sufficiently fast (without\ninterrupting slow roll), even in cases where the normal modes have masses\napproaching the cutoff of our theory. We emphasise that turning is defined with\nrespect to the geodesics of the sigma model metric, irrespective of whether\nthis is canonical or non-trivial. The imprints generically take the form of\ndamped superimposed oscillations on the power spectrum. In the particular case\nof two-field models, if one of the fields is sufficiently massive compared to\nthe scale of inflation, we are able to compute an effective low energy theory\nfor the adiabatic mode encapsulating certain relevant operators of the full\nmulti-field dynamics. As expected, a particular characteristic of this\neffective theory is a modified speed of sound for the adiabatic mode which is a\nfunctional of the background inflaton trajectory and the turns traversed during\ninflation.

Motivated by this fact, we\nexplore the possibility of extending the electromagnetic theory by allowing the\nscalar state which is usually eliminated by means of the Lorenz condition to\npropagate, preserving at the same time the dynamics of ordinary transverse\nphotons. We show that the new state cannot be generated by charged currents,\nbut it breaks conformal invariance and can be excited gravitationally. In fact,\nprimordial quantum fluctuations produced during inflation can give rise to\nsuper-Hubble temporal electromagnetic modes whose energy density behaves as a\ncosmological constant. The value of the effective cosmological constant is\nshown to agree with observations provided inflation took place at the\nelectroweak scale. The theory is compatible with all the local gravity tests\nand is free from classical or quantum instabilities. Thus we see that, not only\nthe true nature of dark energy can be established without resorting to new\nphysics, but also the value of the cosmological constant finds a natural\nexplanation in the context of standard inflationary cosmology.

We study the common origin of mu-tau and CP breaking in the\nDirac mass matrix of seesaw Lagrangian (with right-handed neutrinos being\nmu-tau blind), which uniquely leads to inverted mass-ordering of light\nneutrinos.

The Electroweak parameter\nDelta r relating the values of the gauge boson masses [MW,MZ] and the Fermi\nconstant [G_F] is the traditional observable encoding high precision\ninformation of the electroweak physics at the quantum level. In this work we\npresent a complete quantitative study of Delta r in the framework of the\ngeneral (unconstrained) Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). First of all we report\non a systematic analysis of Delta r at the full one loop level in the general\n2HDM, which to our knowledge was missing in the literature. Thereby we extract\na theoretical prediction for the mass of the W-boson in this model, taking MZ,\n\\alpha_{em} and G_F as experimental inputs. We find typical corrections leading\nto mass shifts $\\delta MW \\sim 20-40 MeV$ which help to improve the agreement\nwith the experimentally measured value, in a degree no less significant than in\nthe MSSM case. In the second part of our study we extend our calculation beyond\nthe mere one-loop order.

This limit constitutes a\ntelltale property of the general 2HDM which is unmatched by e.g. the MSSM. Our\nconclusion is that the Electroweak precision program to be conducted at the\nLHC, and maybe at a future linear collider, can nicely complement the direct\nsearches.

The\nvolume-suppression of the rate for this process [relative to 2-body decay into\nheavy Standard Model (SM) final states ($W/Z/t/H$)] may be partially\ncompensated by the simplicity of the photon final state.

Unfortunately, practical truncations of $n$PIEA can\nunphysically violate symmetries. Pilaftsis and Teresi (PT) addressed this by\nintroducing a \"symmetry improvement\" scheme in the context of the 2PIEA for an\nO(2) scalar theory, ensuring that the Goldstone boson is massless in the broken\nsymmetry phase [A. Pilaftsis and D. Teresi, Nuc.Phys. B 874, 2 (2013), pp.\n594--619]. We extend this by introducing a symmetry improved 3PIEA for O(N)\ntheories, for which the basic variables are the 1-, 2- and 3-point correlation\nfunctions. This requires the imposition of a Ward identity involving the\n3-point function. The method leads to an infinity of physically distinct\nschemes, though an analogue of d'Alembert's principle is used to single out a\nunique scheme. The standard equivalence hierarchy of $n$PIEA no longer holds\nwith symmetry improvement and we investigate the difference between the\nsymmetry improved 3PIEA and 2PIEA. We present renormalized equations of motion\nand counter-terms for 2 and 3 loop truncations of the effective action, leaving\ntheir numerical solution to future work. We solve the Hartree-Fock\napproximation and find that our method achieves a middle ground between the\nunimproved 2PIEA and PT methods. The phase transition predicted by our method\nis weakly first order and the Goldstone theorem is satisfied. We also show\nthat, in contrast to PT, the symmetry improved 3PIEA at 2 loops does not\npredict the correct Higgs decay rate, but does at 3 loops. These results\nsuggest that symmetry improvement should not be applied to $n$PIEA truncated to\n$<n$ loops. We also show that symmetry improvement is compatible with the\nColeman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, a check on the consistency of the formalism. \n\n"}

Remarkably, we\nfind that stoponium searches are highly complementary to direct collider\nsearches and indirect probes of light stops such as Higgs coupling\nmeasurements. Using an empirical quarkonia potential model and including the\nfirst two $S$-wave stoponium states, we find that in the decoupling limit\n$m_{\\widetilde t_1} \\lesssim 130$ GeV is excluded for any value of the stop\nmixing angle and heavy stop mass by the combination of the latest resonance\nsearches and the indirect constraints.

In\nthis model, baryogenesis occurs without $(B-L)$-violation, since the $(B+L)$\nasymmetry generated by the hypermagnetic field counteracts the washout by\nelectroweak sphalerons. At the electroweak crossover, the hypermagnetic field\nbecomes an electromagnetic field, which does not source $(B+L)$.

However, the situation is less understood in\ninteracting theories, especially on time scales longer than the dynamical\nrelaxation time. Recently there have been claims that the quantum theory\ndeviates spectacularly from the classical theory on this time scale, even if\nthe occupancy numbers are extremely large. Furthermore, it is claimed that the\nquantum theory quickly thermalizes while the classical theory does not. The\nevidence for these claims comes from noticing a spectacular difference in the\ntime evolution of expectation values of quantum operators compared to the\nclassical micro-state evolution. If true, this would have dramatic consequences\nfor many important phenomena, including laboratory studies of interacting BECs,\ndark matter axions, preheating after inflation, etc. In this work we critically\nexamine these claims. We show that in fact the classical theory can describe\nthe quantum behavior in the high occupancy regime, even when interactions are\nlarge. The connection is that the expectation values of quantum operators in a\nsingle quantum micro-state are approximated by a corresponding classical\nensemble average over many classical micro-states. Furthermore, by the ergodic\ntheorem, a classical ensemble average of local fields with statistical\ntranslation invariance is the spatial average of a single micro-state.

In this paper we study the twin\nneutrino in the mass range $\\sim$ 0.1--10 GeV as the dark matter. The thermal\nrelic density is determined by the interplay of several annihilation and\nscattering processes between the twin neutrino, twin tau, and twin photon,\ndepending on the order of the freeze-out temperatures of these processes.\nBesides the common coannihilation scenario where the relic density is\ncontrolled by the twin tau annihilation, it can realize the recently discovered\ncoscattering phase if the scattering of the twin neutrino into the twin tau\nfreezes out earlier than the twin tau annihilation. We also provide a method to\ncalculate the thermal relic density in the intermediate regime where both\ncoannihilation and coscattering processes contribute to the determination of\nthe dark matter density.

The\nparticle mass is generated by the expectation value of a scalar field which\ndoes not have a stable vacuum state, but which is effectively stabilized by the\nrest energy of the ambient particles. As the universe expands, the density of\nparticles decreases, leading to an increase in the vacuum expectation value of\nthe scalar (and hence the mass of the particle).

Secondly, the galaxy distribution has been observed to be\nfractal in scales up to hundreds of Mpc. We give here a short review of the\nstatistical mechanical (and field theoretical) approach developed by us. We\nconsider a non-relativistic self-gravitating gas in thermal equilibrium at\ntemperature T inside a volume V. The statistical mechanics of such system has\nspecial features and, as is known, the thermodynamical limit does not exist in\nits customary form. Moreover, the treatments through microcanonical, canonical\nand grand canonical ensembles yield different results.We present here for the\nfirst time the equation of state for the self-gravitating gas in the canonical\nensemble. We find that it has the form p = [N T/ V] f(eta), where p is the\npressure, N is the number of particles and \\eta \\equiv {G m^2 N \\over V^{1/3}\nT}. The N \\to\\infty and V \\to\\infty limit exists keeping \\eta fixed. We compute\nthe function f(\\eta) using Monte Carlo simulations and for small eta\nanalytically. We compute the thermodynamic quantities of the system as free\nenergy, entropy, chemical potential, specific heat, compressibility and speed\nof sound. We reproduce the well-known gravitational phase transition associated\nto the Jeans' instability. Namely, a gaseous phase for eta < eta_c and a\ncondensed phase for eta > eta_c. Moreover, we derive the precise behaviour of\nthe physical quantities near the transition. In particular, the pressure\nvanishes as p \\sim(eta_c-eta)^B with B \\sim 0.2 and eta_c \\sim 1.6 and the\nenergy fluctuations diverge as \\sim(eta_c-eta)^{B-1}. The speed of sound\ndecreases monotonically and approaches the value sqrt{T/6} at the transition. \n\n"}
{"id": "astro-ph/9808099", "contents": "Title: No Pulsar Kicks from Deformed Neutrinospheres Abstract: In a supernova core, magnetic fields cause a directional variation of the\nneutrino refractive index so that resonant flavor oscillations would lead to a\ndeformation of the \"neutrinosphere\" for, say, tau neutrinos. The associated\nanisotropic neutrino emission was proposed as a possible origin of the observed\npulsar proper motions. We argue that this effect was vastly overestimated\nbecause the variation of the temperature over the deformed neutrinosphere is\nnot an adequate measure for the anisotropy of neutrino emission. The neutrino\nflux is generated inside the neutron star core and is transported through the\natmosphere at a constant luminosity, forcing the temperature gradient in the\natmosphere to adjust to the inflow of energy from below. Therefore, no emission\nanisotropy is caused by a deformation of the neutrinosphere to lowest order. An\nestimate of the higher-order corrections must take into account the modified\natmospheric temperature profile in response to the deformation of the\nneutrinosphere and the corresponding feedback on the core.

We calculate the limit on the\ninitial abundance of PBHs from the requirement that the present day LSP density\nis less than the critical density. We apply this limit, along with those\npreviously obtained from the effects of PBH evaporation on nucleosynthesis and\nthe present day density of PBHs, to PBHs formed from the collpase of\ninflationary density perturbations, in the context of supersymmetric inflation\nmodels. If the reheat temperature after inflation is low, so as to avoid the\noverproduction of gravitinos and moduli, then the lightest PBHs which are\nproduced in significant numbers will be evaporating around the present day and\nthere are therefore no constraints from the effects of the evaporation products\non nucleosynthesis or from the production of LSPs.

Secondly, the role of the LFV decays to explain the\nLSND excess is discussed in detail, for which the experimental bounds on three\nbody LFV decays, i.e. \\mu -> 3e are used to constraint the coupling\n\\tilde{g}_{Z_{\\mu e}}, which is needed to calculate the anomalous muon decay\n\\mu -> e\\nu_l\\bar{\\nu}_l. Then comparing the effective coupling of anomalous\nmuon decay to r>1.6\\times 10^{-3} [9809524], it is proved that LFV is not the\ncorrect hypothesis to explain the LSND excess. Finally, LFV decays at loop\norder are studied in Seesaw model of neutrino masses [PRL. 86 2502 (2001)]\nwhere the smallness of the Seesaw neutrino mass may be naturally realized with\nm_N (mass of right-handed singlet neutrinos) of order 1 TeV. It is shown that\nthe Higgs mass of a new scalar doublet with lepton number L=-1 needed in the\nmodel has to be larger than 50 TeV to get the branching ratio of \\mu -> 3e to\nbe consistent with the existing bound on \\mu -> 3e. This defeats the original\nmotivation of the model, namely that there is no physics beyond the TeV energy\nscale. \n\n"}

To\nreliably predict astrophysical signatures of color superconductivity, a better\nunderstanding of the role of the star's magnetic field in the color\nsuperconducting phase that realizes in the core is required. This paper is an\ninitial step in that direction. The field scales at which the different\nmagnetic phases of a color superconductor with three quark flavors can be\nrealized are investigated. Coming from weak to strong fields, the system\nundergoes first a symmetry transmutation from a Color-Flavor-Locked (CFL) phase\nto a Magnetic-CFL (MCFL) phase, and then a phase transition from the MCFL phase\nto the Paramagnetic-CFL (PCFL) phase.
