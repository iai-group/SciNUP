Partons off-shell by $k_T^2$ are considered in both quark diagrams and\neffective diagrams for the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) pion wave\nfunction.

For a qualitative\nestimate, we model the body with a homogeneous sphere and express the tidal\nphase lag through the lag in a sample of material. Although simplistic, our\nmodel is sufficient to understand that the lags are not identical. The\ndifference emerges because self-gravitation pulls the tidal bulge down. At low\nfrequencies, this reduces strain and makes tidal damping less efficient in\nlarger bodies. At high frequencies, competition between self-gravitation and\nrheology becomes more complex, though for sufficiently large superearths the\nsame rule works: the larger the body, the weaker tidal damping in it. Being\nnegligible for small terrestrial planets and moons, the difference between the\nseismic and tidal lagging (and likewise between the seismic and tidal damping)\nbecomes very considerable for superearths. In those, it is much lower than what\none might expect from using a seismic quality factor. The tidal damping rate\ndeviates from the seismic damping rate especially in the zero-frequency limit,\nand this difference takes place for bodies of any size. So the equal in\nmagnitude but opposite in sign tidal torques, exerted on one another by the\nprimary and the secondary, go smoothly through zero as the secondary crosses\nthe synchronous orbit.

To\nimplement this additional flexibility, we reformulate the Andrade model by\nendowing it with a free parameter which is the ratio of the anelastic timescale\nto the viscoelastic Maxwell time of the mantle. Some uncertainty in this\nparameter's frequency-dependence does not influence our principal conclusions. \n\n"}

{"id": "1105.6086", "contents": "Title: Bodily tides near spin-orbit resonances Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling can be described in two approaches. The method known as\n\"the MacDonald torque\" is often combined with an assumption that the quality\nfactor Q is frequency-independent. This makes the method inconsistent, because\nthe MacDonald theory tacitly fixes the rheology by making Q scale as the\ninverse tidal frequency.\n  Spin-orbit coupling can be treated also in an approach called \"the Darwin\ntorque\". While this theory is general enough to accommodate an arbitrary\nfrequency-dependence of Q, this advantage has not yet been exploited in the\nliterature, where Q is assumed constant or is set to scale as inverse tidal\nfrequency, the latter assertion making the Darwin torque equivalent to a\ncorrected version of the MacDonald torque.\n  However neither a constant nor an inverse-frequency Q reflect the properties\nof realistic mantles and crusts, because the actual frequency-dependence is\nmore complex. Hence the necessity to enrich the theory of spin-orbit\ninteraction with the right frequency-dependence. We accomplish this programme\nfor the Darwin-torque-based model near resonances. We derive the\nfrequency-dependence of the tidal torque from the first principles, i.e., from\nthe expression for the mantle's compliance in the time domain. We also explain\nthat the tidal torque includes not only the secular part, but also an\noscillating part.\n  We demonstrate that the lmpq term of the Darwin-Kaula expansion for the tidal\ntorque smoothly goes through zero, when the secondary traverses the lmpq\nresonance (e.g., the principal tidal torque smoothly goes through nil as the\nsecondary crosses the synchronous orbit).\n  We also offer a possible explanation for the unexpected frequency-dependence\nof the tidal dissipation rate in the Moon, discovered by LLR. \n\n"}

The crucial cut, which is applied to\nmaximize signal significance, is on (pseudo)rapidity difference between the two\njets. This is due to the exponential growing of the QCD background contribution\nwith this variable. Usually it is assumed that signal from almost all exotic\nmodels populates the central dijet rapidity region y_{1,2} ~ 0 and |y_1-y_2| ~\n0. By contrast, the excited bosons do not contribute into this region, but\nproduce an excess of dijet events over the almost flat QCD background in chi =\nexp|y_1-y_2| away from this region. Therefore, different sets of cuts should be\napplied for new physics search depending on the searched resonance properties.\nIn order to confirm the bump and reveal the resonance nature various angular\ndistributions should be used in addition. In particular, for the excited bosons\nthe special choice of parameters could lead to a dip in the centrality ratio\ndistribution over the dijet invariant mass instead of a bump, expected in the\nmost exotic models. \n\n"}

The Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) eliminates the\nrenormalization scale ambiguity in precision tests of Abelian QED and\nnon-Abelian QCD theories. In this paper we apply PMC scale-setting to predict\nthe $t \\bar t$ cross-section $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ at the Tevatron and LHC\ncolliders. It is found that $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ remains almost unchanged by\nvarying $\\mu^{\\rm init}_r$ within the region of $[m_t/4,4m_t]$. The convergence\nof the expansion series is greatly improved. For the $(q\\bar{q})$-channel,\nwhich is dominant at the Tevatron, its NLO PMC scale is much smaller than the\ntop-quark mass in the small $x$-region, and thus its NLO cross-section is\nincreased by about a factor of two.

The\ncontradiction requires the MacDonald treatment of both non-resonant and\nresonant rotation to be rewritten.\n  The non-resonant case was reconsidered by Efroimsky & Williams (2009; CMDA\n104, 257), in application to spin modes distant from the major\ncommensurabilities. We continue this work by introducing the necessary\nalterations into the MacDonald-torque-based model of falling into a 1:1\nresonance. (For the original version of the model, see Goldreich 1966; AJ 71,\n1.)\n  We also study the effect of the triaxiality on both circulating and librating\nrotation near the synchronous state. Circulating rotation may evolve toward the\nlibration region or toward a spin rate larger than synchronous\n(pseudosynchronous spin). Which behaviour depends on the eccentricity, the\ntriaxiality of the primary, and the mass ratio of the secondary and primary\nbodies. The spin evolution will always stall for the oblate case. For\nsmall-amplitude librations, expressions are derived for the libration\nfrequency, damping rate, and average orientation.\n  However, the stability of pseudosynchronous spin hinges upon the dissipation\nmodel. Makarov and Efroimsky (2012; arXiv:1209.1616) have found that a more\nrealistic dissipation model than the corrected MacDonald torque makes\npseudosynchronous spin unstable. \n\n"}

Actually, it\nseems a difficult goal to be realistically achieved for a number of reasons.\nFirst, the LT range signature of a Galileo-type satellite is as little as $0.5$\nmm over 3-days arcs, corresponding to a node rate of just $\\dot\\Omega_{\\rm\nLT}=2$ milliarcseconds per year (mas yr$^{-1}$). Some tesseral and sectorial\nocean tides such as $K_1,K_2$ induce long-period harmonic node perturbations\nwith frequencies which are integer multiples of the extremely slow Galileo's\nnode rate $\\dot\\Omega$ completing a full cycle in about 40 yr.

Three examples:\n  Mercury, Io, and Kepler-10 b Abstract: In Efroimsky & Makarov (2014), we derived from the first principles a formula\nfor the tidal heating rate in a tidally perturbed homogeneous sphere. We\ncompared it with the formulae used in the literature, and pointed out the\ndifferences. Using this result, we now present three case studies - Mercury,\nKepler-10b, and a triaxial Io. A very sharp frequency-dependence of k2/Q near\nspin-orbit resonances yields a similarly sharp dependence of k2/Q on the spin\nrate. This indicates that physical libration may play a major role in tidal\nheating of synchronously rotating bodies. The magnitude of libration in the\nspin rate being defined by the planet's triaxiality, the latter should be a\nfactor determining the dissipation rate. Other parameters equal, a\nsynchronously rotating body with a stronger triaxiality should generate more\nheat than a similar body of a more symmetrical shape. Further in the paper, we\ndiscuss scenarios where initially triaxial objects melt and lose their\ntriaxiality. Thereafter, dissipation in them becomes less intensive; so the\nbodies freeze. The tidal bulge becomes a new permanent figure, with a new\ntriaxiality lower than the original. In the paper, we also derive simplified,\napproximate expressions for dissipation rate in a rocky planet of the Maxwell\nrheology, with a not too small Maxwell time. The three expressions derived\npertain to the cases of a synchronous spin, a 3:2 resonance, and a nonresonant\nrotation; so they can be applied to most close-in super-Earth exoplanets\ndetected thus far. In such bodies, the rate of tidal heating outside of\nsynchronous rotation is weakly dependent on the eccentricity and obliquity,\nprovided both these parameters are small or moderate.

The measured decay rates\nare related to the product of the relevant weak-interaction-based CKM matrix\nelement of the constituent quarks and a strong interaction parameter related to\nthe overlap of the quark and antiquark wave-functions in the meson, called the\ndecay constant $f_P$.

The GF sub-process exhibits strong correlations in\nthe azimuthal angles $\\phi_{1,2}^{}$ of the two jets measured from the\nproduction plane of the Higgs boson pair and the difference between these two\nangles $\\phi_1^{}-\\phi_2^{}$, and a very small correlation in the sum of them\n$\\phi_1^{}+\\phi_2^{}$. The impact of using a finite top mass $m_t^{}$ value on\nthe correlations is found crucial. The transverse momentum of the Higgs boson\ncan be used to enhance or suppress the correlations. The impact of a\nnon-standard value for the triple Higgs self-coupling on the correlations is\nfound much smaller than that on other observables, such as the invariant mass\nof the two Higgs bosons. The peak shifts of the azimuthal angle distributions\nreflect the magnitude of parity violation in the $gg\\to HH$ amplitude and the\ndependence of the distributions on parity violating phases is analytically\nclarified. The WBF sub-process also produces correlated distributions and it is\nfound that they are not induced by the quantum effect of the intermediate weak\nbosons but mainly by a kinematic effect. This kinematic effect is a\ncharacteristic feature of the WBF sub-process and is not observed in the GF\nsub-process. It is found that the correlations are different in the GF and in\nthe WBF sub-processes. As part of the process dependent information, they will\nbe helpful in the analyses of both the GF sub-process and the WBF sub-process\nat the LHC. \n\n"}

This particle (denoted\nhere by $H_3$) is weakly mixed with the Standard Model Higgs field ($h$) with\nmixing $\\theta_1\\lesssim m_{H_3}/m_h$, barring fine-tuned cancellation. In the\nspecific case when the $B-L$ symmetry is embedded into the TeV scale left-right\nseesaw scenario, we show that the bounds on the $h-H_3$ mixing $\\theta_1$\nbecome further strengthened due to low energy flavor constraints, thus forcing\nthe light $H_3$ to be long lived, with displaced vertex signals at the LHC. The\nproperty of left-right TeV scale seesaw models are such that they make the\n$H_3$ decay to two photons as the dominant mode.

Recent gravity and\nlibration data indicate that Enceladus's icy crust floats on a global ocean, is\nrather thin, and has a strongly non-uniform thickness. Tidal effects are\nenhanced by crustal thinning at the south pole, so that realistic models of\ntidal tectonics and dissipation should take into account the lateral variations\nof shell structure. I construct here the theory of non-uniform viscoelastic\nthin shells, allowing for depth-dependent rheology and large lateral variations\nof shell thickness and rheology. Coupling to tides yields two 2D linear partial\ndifferential equations of the 4th order on the sphere which take into account\nself-gravity, density stratification below the shell, and core viscoelasticity.\nIf the shell is laterally uniform, the solution agrees with analytical formulas\nfor tidal Love numbers; errors on displacements and stresses are less than 5%\nand 15%, respectively, if the thickness is less than 10% of the radius. If the\nshell is non-uniform, the tidal thin shell equations are solved as a system of\ncoupled linear equations in a spherical harmonic basis. Compared to finite\nelement models, thin shell predictions are similar for the deformations due to\nEnceladus's pressurized ocean, but differ for the tides of Ganymede. If\nEnceladus's shell is conductive with isostatic thickness variations, surface\nstresses are approximately inversely proportional to the local shell thickness.\nThe radial tide is only moderately enhanced at the south pole. The combination\nof crustal thinning and convection below the poles can amplify south polar\nstresses by a factor of 10, but it cannot explain the apparent time lag between\nthe maximum plume brightness and the opening of tiger stripes. In a second\npaper, I will study tidal dissipation in a non-uniform crust. \n\n"}

Although many rocky exoplanets closely\norbiting their host stars have been detected, all studies to date of plate\ntectonics on exoplanets have neglected tidal stresses in the planet's\nlithosphere. Modeling a rocky exoplanet as a constant density, homogeneous,\nincompressible sphere, we show the tidal stress from the host star acting on\nclose-in planets may become comparable to the stress on the lithosphere from\nmantle convection.

This requires to give a precise and gauge-invariant meaning to\nthe underlying physics. This is complicated by the fact that concepts like the\nHiggs vacuum expectation value or the separation between confinement and the\nBEH effect loose their meaning beyond perturbation theory. This is addressed by\ncarefully constructing the corresponding theory space and the quantum phase\ndiagram. The physical spectrum needs then to be also given in terms of\ngauge-invariant, i. e. composite, states. Using gauge-invariant perturbation\ntheory, as developed by Froehlich, Morchio, and Strocchi, it is possible to\nrederive conventional perturbation theory. This derivation explicitly shows why\nthe description of the standard model in terms of the unphysical,\ngauge-dependent, elementary states of the Higgs and W-bosons and Z-boson, but\nalso of the elementary fermions, is adequate and successful. These are\nunavoidable consequences of the field theory underlying the standard model,\nfrom which the usual picture emerges. The validity of this emergence can only\nbe tested non-perturbatively. Such tests, in particular using lattice gauge\ntheory, will be reviewed as well.

We find the mean grain\nsize of silicate minerals to be a key control on magma ascent. For grain sizes\nlarger than $\\approx$ 1 mm, melt segregation produces distinct radial structure\nand chemical stratification. This stratification is most pronounced for bodies\nformed at around 1 Myr after formation of Ca,Al-rich inclusions. These findings\nsuggest a link between the time and orbital location of planetesimal formation\nand their subsequent structural and chemical evolution. According to our\nmodels, the evolution of partially molten planetesimal interiors falls into two\ncategories. In the magma ocean scenario, the whole interior of a planetesimal\nexperiences nearly complete melting, which would result in turbulent convection\nand core-mantle differentiation by the rainfall mechanism. In the magma sill\nscenario, segregating melts gradually deplete the deep interior of the\nradiogenic heat source. In this case, magma may form melt-rich layers beneath a\ncool and stable lid, while core formation would proceed by percolation.

The\nstandard model is updated to include the dissolution of accreting rocky\nplanetesimals in the gaseous envelope of the planet, leading to substantial\nenrichment of the envelope mass in heavy elements and a non-uniform composition\nwith depth. For Kepler-36 c, models involving in situ formation and models\ninvolving orbital migration are considered. The results are compared with\nstandard formation models. The calculations include the formation (accretion)\nphase, as well as the subsequent cooling phase, up to the age of Kepler-36 (7\nGyr). During the latter phase, mass loss induced by stellar XUV radiation is\nincluded. In all cases, the results fit the measured mass, 7.84 M$_\\oplus$, and\nradius, 3.68 R$_\\oplus$, of Kepler-36 c. Two parameters are varied to obtain\nthese fits: the disk solid surface density at the formation location, and the\n\"efficiency\" factor in the XUV mass loss rate. The updated models are hotter\nand therefore less dense in the silicate portion of the planet and in the\noverlying layers of H/He, as compared with standard models. The lower densities\nmean that only about half as much H/He is needed to be accreted to fit the\npresent-day mass and radius constraints.

First, we advocate that the two nonets form the flavor nonet\napproximately satisfying the Gell-Mann--Okubo mass relation. Then we reexamine\nthe mass ordering generated from the tetraquark nonets and show that this mass\nordering is satisfied by the two nonets although the ordering in the heavy\nnonet is marginal. The marginal mass ordering however can be regarded as\nanother signature for tetraquarks because it can be explained partially by the\nhyperfine masses calculated from the tetraquark mixing framework. The\ntetraquark mixing parameters are found to be independent of isospins giving\nadditional support for the formation of the flavor nonets. In addition, we\ndiscuss the other approaches like two-quark pictures or meson-meson bound\nstates, and their possible limitations in explaining the two nonets.

We review the recent developments in this field.\nWe demonstrate with a simple quantum-mechanical example that it is a very\nnatural property of quantum systems that a symmetry breaking effect which is\nimportant for the low-lying spectrum of the system, can become unimportant for\nthe highly-lying states; the highly lying states reveal a multiplet structure\nof nearly degenerate states. Using the well established concepts of\nquark-hadron duality, asymptotic freedom in QCD and validity of the operator\nproduct expansion in QCD we show that the spectral densities obtained with the\nlocal currents that are connected to each other via chiral transformations,\nvery high in the spectrum must coincide. Hence effects of spontaneous breaking\nof chiral symmetry in QCD vacuum that are crucially important for the low-lying\nspectra, become irrelevant for the highly-lying states.

Instead, we use\nin this channel,for the first time, Finite Energy Sum Rules (FESR), which\nexhibit a nice stability in the QCD continuum threshold t_c, at which one can\nextract, with a good accuracy, the mass of the lowest resonance. Including the\nD=7, 9 condensate contributions in the OPE, we obtain M_Theta=(1513+- 114) MeV,\nand the corresponding residue lambda_Theta^2= -(0.14-- 0.49)x 10^{-9} GeV^{12},\nwhich favours the I=0, J=1/2, and negative parity S-wave interpretation of the\nTheta (1540).

An excellent best fit to the data is\nobtained in this case, suggesting the possibility of a family non-universal Z'\nwith properties similar to ones predicted in a class of superstring theories. \n\n"}

In modern science increasingly larger groups of\nresearchers collaborate on a given topic over extended periods of time. The\nlogging and sharing of knowledge about how analyses are performed or how\nresults are obtained is important throughout the lifetime of a project. Here is\nwhere virtual data concepts play a major role. The ability to seamlessly log,\nexchange and reproduce results and the methods, algorithms and computer\nprograms used in obtaining them enhances in a qualitative way the level of\ncollaboration in a group or between groups in larger organizations.\n  The CAVES project takes a pragmatic approach in assessing the needs of a\ncommunity of scientists by building series of prototypes with increasing\nsophistication. In extending the functionality of existing data analysis\npackages with virtual data capabilities these prototypes provide an easy and\nhabitual entry point for researchers to explore virtual data concepts in real\nlife applications and to provide valuable feedback for refining the system\ndesign. The architecture is modular based on Web, Grid and other services which\ncan be plugged in as desired. As a proof of principle we build a first system\nby extending the very popular data analysis framework ROOT, widely used in high\nenergy physics and other fields, making it virtual data enabled. \n\n"}
