Such global\nCompton scattering has previously been shown to be important for the dynamics\nof accretion flows. Here, we extend previous treatments of this problem by\nusing accurate global general relativistic Monte Carlo simulations. We focus on\nan inner region of the accretion flow (R < 600R_g), for which we obtain a\nglobal self-consistent solution. As compared to the initial, not\nself-consistent solution, the final solution has both the cooling rate and the\nelectron temperature significantly reduced at radii >=10 gravitational radii.\nOn the other hand, the radiation spectrum of the self-consistent solution has\nthe shape similar to that of the initial iteration, except for the high-energy\ncut-off being at an energy lower by a factor of ~2 and the bolometric\nluminosity decreased by a factor of ~2. We also compare the global Compton\nscattering model with local models in spherical and slab geometry. We find that\nthe slab model approximates the global model significantly better than the\nspherical one. Still, neither local model gives a good approximation to the\nradial profile of the cooling rate, and the differences can be up to two orders\nof magnitude. The local slab model underestimates the cooling rate at outer\nregions whereas it overestimates that rate at inner regions. We compare our\nmodelling results to observed hard-state spectra of black-hole binaries and\nfind an overall good agreement provided any disc outflow is weak.

Oscillations in the growth rate as a\nfunction of the magnetic field strength are due to this varying phase shift. A\nvertical magnetic field hardly affects the cycle efficiency in the regime of\nsuper-Alfvenic accretion that is considered.

These magnetic effects are\nsignificant for large-scale modes if the Alfven velocity is a sizable fraction\nof the flow velocity. \n\n"}

We\ninvestigate the information-theoretic limits of communication with such limited\nknowledge at the nodes. We develop a novel transmission strategy, namely Coded\nLayer Scheduling, that solely relies on 1-local view at the nodes and\nincorporates three different techniques: (1) per layer interference avoidance,\n(2) repetition coding to allow overhearing of the interference, and (3) network\ncoding to allow interference neutralization. We show that our proposed scheme\ncan provide a significant throughput gain compared with the conventional\ninterference avoidance strategies. Furthermore, we show that our strategy\nmaximizes the achievable normalized sum-rate for some classes of networks,\nhence, characterizing the normalized sum-capacity of those networks with\n1-local view. \n\n"}

We show\nthat this may imply that Polaris is currently losing mass at a rate of $\\dot{M}\n\\approx 10^{-6} M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ based on the difference between modeled and\nobserved rates of period change, consistent with pulsation-enhanced Cepheid\nmass loss.

In\nthis paper we prove that the zeta correlation function is time-independent at\none-loop level in single clock inflation. While many of the one-loop diagrams\nlead to a time-dependence when considered individually, the time-dependence\nbeautifully cancels out in the overall sum. We identify two subsets of diagrams\nthat cancel separately due to different physical reasons. The first\ncancellation is related to the change of the background cosmology due to the\nrenormalization of the stress tensor. It results in a cancellation between the\nnon-1PI diagrams and some of the diagrams made with quartic vertices. The\nsecond subset of diagrams that cancel is made up of cubic operators, plus the\nremaining quartic ones. We are able to write the sum of these diagrams as the\nintegral over a specific three-point function between two very short\nwavelengths and one very long one. We then apply the consistency condition for\nthis three-point function in the squeezed limit to show that the sum of these\ndiagrams cannot give rise to a time dependence. This second cancellation is\nthus a consequence of the fact that in single clock inflation the attractor\nnature of the solution implies that a long wavelength zeta perturbation is\nindistinguishable from a trivial rescaling of the background, and so results in\nno physical effect on short wavelength modes. \n\n"}

However, the large fractional amplitudes (up to ~20%)\nobserved are difficult to reconcile with predicted amplitudes of starquakes.\nHere we demonstrate that the steeply pulsed emission profile in the tail of the\ngiant flare can enhance the observed amplitude of the underlying oscillation,\nanalogously to a beam of light oscillating in and out of the line of sight.\nThis mechanism will also broaden the feature in the power spectrum and\nintroduce power at harmonics of the oscillation.

We find that early on the amplitude of the\ndipolar mode of the shock is factors of 2 to 3 smaller in 3D than in 2D.\nHowever, later in both 3D and 2D the monopole and dipole modes start to grow\nuntil explosion. Whereas in 2D the (l,m) = (1,0) mode changes sign\nquasi-periodically, producing the \"up-and-down\" motion always seen in modern 2D\nsimulations, in 3D this almost never happens. Rather, in 3D when the dipolar\nmode starts to grow, it grows in magnitude and wanders stochastically in\ndirection until settling before explosion to a particular patch of solid angle.\nIn 2D we find that the amplitude of the dipolar shock deformation separates\ninto two classes. For the first, identified with the SASI and for a wide range\nof \"low\" neutrino luminosities, this amplitude remains small and roughly\nconstant. For the other, identified with higher luminosities and\nneutrino-driven convection, the dipolar amplitude grows sharply. Importantly,\nit is only for this higher luminosity class that we see neutrino-driven\nexplosions within ~1 second of bounce. Moreover, for the \"low\" luminosity runs,\nthe power spectra of these dipolar oscillations peak in the 30-50 Hz range\nassociated with advection timescales, while for the high-luminosity runs the\npower spectra at lower frequencies are significantly more prominent. We\nassociate this enhanced power at lower frequencies with slower convective\neffects and the secular growth of the dipolar shock amplitude.

Their orbital evolution depends on the physical mechanisms that\ncause tidal dissipation, and these are still not well understood. We refine the\ntheory of the equilibrium tide in fluid bodies that are partly or entirely\nconvective, to predict the dynamical evolution of the systems. In particular,\nwe examine the validity of modeling the tidal dissipation by the quality factor\nQ, as is commonly done. We consider here the simplest case where the considered\nstar or planet rotates uniformly, all spins are aligned, and the companion is\nreduced to a point-mass. The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the\nshape of the star or planet adiabatically along the line of centers. This\ngenerates the divergence-free velocity field of the adiabatic equilibrium tide\nwhich is decoupled from the dynamical tide. The tidal kinetic energy is\ndissipated into heat through turbulent friction, which is modeled here as an\neddy-viscosity acting on the adiabatic tidal flow. This dissipation induces a\nsecond velocity field, the dissipative equilibrium tide, which is in quadrature\nwith the exciting potential; it is responsible for the imaginary part of the\ndisturbing function, which is implemented in the dynamical evolution equations,\nfrom which one derives characteristic evolution times. The rate at which the\nsystem evolves depends on the physical properties of tidal dissipation, and\nspecifically on how the eddy viscosity varies with tidal frequency and on the\nthickness of the convective envelope for the fluid equilibrium tide. At low\nfrequency, this tide retards by a constant time delay, whereas it lags by a\nconstant angle when the tidal frequency exceeds the convective turnover rate. \n\n"}

Coordinated resource allocation is the\nkey to efficient performance, but the demand on backhaul signaling and\ncomputational resources grows rapidly with number of cells, terminals, and\nsubcarriers. To handle this, we propose a novel multicell framework with\ndynamic cooperation clusters where each terminal is jointly served by a small\nset of base stations. Each base station coordinates interference to neighboring\nterminals only, thus limiting backhaul signalling and making the framework\nscalable. This framework can describe anything from interference channels to\nideal joint multicell transmission.\n  The resource allocation (i.e., precoding and scheduling) is formulated as an\noptimization problem (P1) with performance described by arbitrary monotonic\nfunctions of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINRs) and arbitrary\nlinear power constraints. Although (P1) is non-convex and difficult to solve\noptimally, we are able to prove: 1) Optimality of single-stream beamforming; 2)\nConditions for full power usage; and 3) A precoding parametrization based on a\nfew parameters between zero and one. These optimality properties are used to\npropose low-complexity strategies: both a centralized scheme and a distributed\nversion that only requires local channel knowledge and processing. We evaluate\nthe performance on measured multicell channels and observe that the proposed\nstrategies achieve close-to-optimal performance among centralized and\ndistributed solutions, respectively. In addition, we show that multicell\ninterference coordination can give substantial improvements in sum performance,\nbut that joint transmission is very sensitive to synchronization errors and\nthat some terminals can experience performance degradations. \n\n"}

The ensuing collision between the fast ejecta and the CSM causes an\nincrease in brightness observed at the end of 1844, followed by a sustained\nhigh-luminosity phase lasting for 10-15 years that matches the historical light\ncurve. The emergent luminosity is powered by CSM interaction, analogous to the\nprocess in luminous Type IIn supernovae, except with 10 times lower explosion\nenergy and at slower speeds (causing a longer duration and lower emergent\nluminosity). Such an explosive event provides a natural explanation for the\nlight curve evolution, but also accounts for a number of puzzling attributes of\nthe Homunculus nebula: (1) rough equipartition of total radiated and kinetic\nenergy, (2) the double-shell structure of the Homunculus, (3) the apparent\nsingle age and Hubble-like flow resulting from the thin swept-up shell, (4) the\ncomplex mottled appearance of the polar lobes in HST images, arising from\nRaleigh-Taylor or Vishniac instabilities, (5) efficient and rapid dust\nformation, as seen in Type IIn supernovae, and (6) the fast (5000 km/s)\nmaterial outside the Homunculus, arising from the acceleration of the forward\nshock upon exiting the dense CSM.

Abstract: Soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are two groups\nof enigmatic objects, which have been extensively investigated in past few\ndecades.

The nature and nurture of\nSGRs/AXPs remain controversial. In this paper, we propose that SGRs/AXPs can\noriginate from normal NSs in binary systems. SGRs are a class of objects\ncontaining a neutron-drip core and denser crust with a stiffer equation of\nstate, which is formed from re-explosion of normal NSs in binary systems.

We suggest that the quasi-periodicity feature of\ntiming noise, with rapid oscillations lying on lower frequency structure, comes\nfrom the geodetic precession of an unseen binary system, which induces\nadditional motion of the pulsar spin axis. The resultant change of azimuth and\nlatitude at which the observer's line of sight crosses the emission beam is\nresponsible for the variation of timing noise and pulse profile respectively.\nThe first numerical simulation to both timing noise and pulse profile variation\nare thus performed, from which the orbital periods of these pulsars are of 1-35\nminutes. Considering the existence of the ultracompact binary white dwarf of\norbital period of 5.4 minute, HM Cancri, such orbital periods to pulsar\nbinaries are not strange. The change of latitude of the magnetic moment\nexceeding the range of emission beam of a pulsar results in the intermittency,\nwhich explains the behavior of PSR B1931+24.

Located near the cluster core of Westerlund 2, WR\n20a is composed of two nearly identical Wolf- Rayet stars of 82 and 83 solar\nmasses orbiting with a period of only 3.7 days. Although Chandra observations\nwere taken during the secondary optical eclipse, the X-ray light curve shows no\nsigns of a flux decrement. In fact, WR 20a appears slightly more X-ray luminous\nand softer during the optical eclipse, opposite to what has been observed in\nother binary systems. To aid in our interpretation of the data, we compare with\nthe results of hydrodynamical simulations using the adaptive mesh refinement\ncode Mezcal that includes radiative cooling and a radiative acceleration force\nterm. It is shown that the X-ray emission can be successfully explained in\nmodels where the wind-wind collision interface in this system occurs while the\noutflowing material is still being accelerated. Consequently, WR 20a serves as\na critical test-case for how radiatively-driven stellar winds initiate and\ninteract.

We propose a new method to analyse pulsar nulling phenomenon, by\ninvolving two key parameters, the nulling degree, $\\chi$, which is defined as\nthe angle in a rectangular coordinates for the numbers of nulling periods and\nbursting periods, and the nulling scale, $ N $, which is defined as the\neffective length of the consecutive nulling periods and bursting periods.

The paper is a general introduction to\nsystematic investigations of the geodesic structure of physically relevant\nspacetimes. The investigations are focussed on the search of locally and\nglobally maximal timelike geodesics. The method of dealing with the local\nproblem is in a sense algorithmic and is based on the geodesic deviation\nequation. Yet the search for globally maximal geodesics is non-algorithmic and\ncannot be treated analytically by solving a differential equation. Here one\nmust apply a mixture of methods: spacetime symmetries (we have effectively\nemployed the spherical symmetry), the use of the comoving coordinates adapted\nto the given congruence of timelike geodesics and the conjugate points on these\ngeodesics. All these methods have been effectively applied in both the local\nand global problems in a number of simple and important spacetimes and their\noutcomes have already been published in three papers.

Initially, LESA seems to develop stochastically from convective\nfluctuations, it exists for hundreds of milliseconds or more, and it persists\nduring violent shock sloshing associated with the standing accretion shock\ninstability. The nue minus antinue flux asymmetry originates mainly below the\nneutrinosphere in a region of pronounced proto-neutron star (PNS) convection,\nwhich is stronger in the hemisphere of enhanced lepton-number flux. On this\nside of the PNS, the mass-accretion rate of lepton-rich matter is larger,\namplifying the lepton-emission asymmetry, because the spherical stellar infall\ndeflects on a dipolar deformation of the stalled shock. The increased shock\nradius in the hemisphere of less mass accretion and minimal lepton-number flux\n(antinue flux maximum) is sustained by stronger convection on this side, which\nis boosted by stronger neutrino heating because the average antinue energy is\nhigher than the average nue energy. Asymmetric heating thus supports the global\ndeformation despite extremely nonstationary convective overturn behind the\nshock.

Ideal quark/gluon\nseparation requires only one bit of truth information, so even if two\ndiscriminant variables are largely uncorrelated, they can still share the same\n\"truth overlap\". Mutual information can be used to diagnose such situations,\nand thus determine which discriminant variables are redundant and which can be\ncombined to improve performance. Using both parton showers and analytic\nresummation, we study a two-parameter family of generalized angularities, which\nincludes familiar infrared and collinear (IRC) safe observables like thrust and\nbroadening, as well as IRC unsafe variants like $p_T^D$ and hadron\nmultiplicity.

We derive sufficient conditions on the minimal amount of\nmeasurements ensuring recovery via convex optimization.

However, if quantum\ngravity had a preferred reference frame, why would high energy processes enjoy\nsuch a high degree of Lorentz symmetry? While this is often considered as an\nargument against aether, here I provide three independent arguments for why\nperturbative unitarity (or weak coupling) of the Lorentz-violating effective\nfield theories put stringent constraints on possible observable violations of\nLorentz symmetry at high energies. In particular, the interaction with the\nscalar graviton in a consistent low-energy theory of gravity and a (radiatively\nand dynamically) stable cosmological framework, leads to these constraints.

Three main techniques can be\nused to achieve this goal. The first involves waveform modelling. The flux we\nobserve from a hotspot on the neutron star surface offset from the rotational\npole will be modulated by the star's rotation, giving rise to a pulsation.\nInformation about mass and radius is encoded into the pulse profile via\nrelativistic effects, and tight constraints on mass and radius can be obtained.\nThe second technique involves characterising the spin distribution of accreting\nneutron stars. The most rapidly rotating stars provide a very clean constraint,\nsince the mass-shedding limit is a function of mass and radius. However the\noverall spin distribution also provides a guide to the torque mechanisms in\noperation and the moment of inertia, both of which can depend sensitively on\ndense matter physics.

Most prior work represents two extreme cases in which either a small\nnumber of RF chains with full-resolution ADCs, or low resolution ADC with a\nnumber of RF chains equal to the number of antennas is assumed.

Using images from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we\nhave discovered transient 3.4 micron emission from several previously known\ntidal disruption flares. The observations can be explained by dust heated to\nits sublimation temperature due to the intense radiation of the tidal flare.\nFrom the break in the infrared light curve we infer that this hot dust is\nlocated ~0.1 pc from the supermassive black hole. Since the dust has been\nheated by absorbing UV and (potentially) soft X-ray photons of the flare, the\nreprocessing light curve yields an estimate of the bolometric flare luminosity.\nFor the flare PTF-09ge, we infer that the most likely value of the luminosity\nintegrated over frequencies at which dust can absorb photons is $8\\times\n10^{44}$ erg/s, with a factor of 3 uncertainty due to the unknown temperature\nof the dust.

While a previous analysis shows a qualitative consistency\nbetween this suggestion and the Swift SGRB data, the distribution of observed\nbreak time $t_b$ is much narrower than the distribution of the collapse time of\nsupramassive NSs for the several NS equations-of-state (EoSs) investigated. In\nthis paper, we study four recently-constructed \"unified\" NS EoSs, as well as\nthree developed strange quark star (QS) EoSs within the new confinement\ndensity-dependent mass model. All the EoSs chosen here satisfy the recent\nobservational constraints of the two massive pulsars whose masses are precisely\nmeasured. We construct sequences of rigidly rotating NS/QS configurations with\nincreasing spinning frequency $f$, from non-rotating ($f = 0$) to the Keplerian\nfrequency ($f = f_{\\rm K}$), and provide convenient analytical parametrizations\nof the results.

Our goal is to jointly design the optimal input\ncovariances for the multicast message, confidential message and AN, such that\nthe achievable secrecy rate region is maximized subject to the sum power\nconstraint. This secrecy rate region maximization (SRRM) problem is a nonconvex\nvector maximization problem.

In order to detect and analyse these signals, accurate\nwaveform templates which include the effects of the compact object's\ngravitational self-force are required.

Employing hydrodynamic\nsimulations in full general relativity, we find that the one-arm instability is\ngeneric in that it can develop in HMNSs within a few tens of milliseconds after\nmerger for all equations of state in our survey. We find that mergers with\nstiffer equations of state tend to produce HMNSs with stronger $m=2$ azimuthal\nmode density deformations, and weaker $m=1$ components, relative to softer\nequations of state. We also find that for equations of state that can give rise\nto double-core HMNSs, large $m=1$ density modes can already be present due to\nasymmetries in the two cores. This results in the generation of $l=2$, $m=1$\ngravitational wave modes even before the dominance of a one-arm mode that\nultimately arises following merger of the two cores. Our results further\nsuggest that stiffer equations of state give rise to HMNSs generating lower\n$m=1$ gravitational wave frequencies.

The fact that simulated reconnection rates are close to the\npredicted maximum suggests reconnection proceeds near the most efficient state\nallowed at the MHD-scale.

Additionally, she observes the remainder of\nthe transmitted symbols through a discrete memoryless channel.

In the dual problem, a source encoder and decoder, who observe\nrandom sequences independent and identically distributed according to the input\nand output distributions of the legitimate channel in the original problem,\ncommunicate a confidential key over a public error-free channel using a single\nforward transmission, in the presence of a compound wiretapping source who has\nperfect access to the public discussion.

Our direct numerical simulations indicate that the dynamo is\npossible in both cases, given a large enough magnetic Reynolds number. To\nexplain the relatively larger effort required to obtain the dynamo action in a\nlong box, we propose that the turbulent eddies caused by the instability most\nefficiently fold and mix the magnetic field lines in the radial direction.

It is found\nthat the fluctuation amplitude starts to grow only when the linear growth rate\nis sufficiently large ($\\gamma_{max}\\tau_{A}>O(1)$) to overcome convective\nlosses. The linear growth rate continues to rise until the sizes of plasmoids\nbecome comparable to the inner layer width of the tearing mode.

In particular, steering of\ncontinuous variable Gaussian states has been extensively studied as a\nmanifestation of the EPR paradox. While most of these studies focused on\nquadrature measurements for steering detection, two recent works revealed that\nthere exist Gaussian states which are only steerable by non-Gaussian\nmeasurements.

We first derive the density matrix elements of\ntwo-mode squeezed thermal states in the Fock basis, which may be of independent\ninterest. We then use such a representation to investigate steering of these\nstates as detected by a nonlinear criterion, based on second moments of the\npseudospin correlation matrix. This analysis reveals previously unexplored\nregimes where non-Gaussian measurements are more effective than Gaussian ones\nto witness steering of Gaussian states in the presence of local noise.

Despite much theoretical/numerical and experimental\nefforts over the last decades, its saturation mechanism and amplitude, which\nsets the angular momentum transport rate, remains not well understood,\nespecially in the limit of high resistivity, or small magnetic Prandtl numbers\ntypical to interiors (dead zones) of protoplanetary disks, liquid cores of\nplanets and liquid metals in laboratory. Using direct numerical simulations, in\nthis paper we investigate the nonlinear development and saturation properties\nof the helical magnetorotational instability (HMRI) -- a relative of the\nstandard MRI -- in a magnetized Taylor-Couette flow at very low magnetic\nPrandtl number (correspondingly at low magnetic Reynolds number) relevant to\nliquid metals. For simplicity, the ratio of azimuthal field to axial field is\nkept fixed. From the linear theory of HMRI, it is known that the Elsasser\nnumber, or interaction parameter determines its growth rate and plays a special\nrole in the dynamics. We show that this parameter is also important in the\nnonlinear problem. By increasing its value, a sudden transition from weakly\nnonlinear, where the system is slightly above the linear stability threshold,\nto strongly nonlinear, or turbulent regime occurs. We calculate the azimuthal\nand axial energy spectra corresponding to these two regimes and show that they\ndiffer qualitatively. Remarkably, the nonlinear state remains in all cases\nnearly axisymmetric suggesting that HMRI turbulence is quasi two-dimensional in\nnature.

Up to now, only a few embedded candidate protoplanets have\nbeen detected with semi-major axes of 20-50 au. Due to the small angular\nseparation from their central star, only long-baseline interferometry provides\nthe angular resolving power to detect disk asymmetries associated to\nprotoplanets at solar system scales in nearby star-forming regions. In\nparticular, infrared observations are crucial to observe scattered stellar\nradiation and thermal re-emission in the vicinity of embedded companions\ndirectly.

For a fixed physical distance, on the other hand, it grows, at late\ntimes, like $-\\lambda\\ln^3(a)$ in the massless limit. This growth is severely\nsuppressed in the massive case. In fact, the one-loop correlator asymptotes\neffectively to zero for masses larger than half the expansion rate. We find out\nalso that the tree-order variance of field variation decreases when quantum\ncorrections are included. Hence, the actual effect that any local observer\nperceives in the field strength as fluctuations happen does not deviate from\nthe average effect as much as the tree-order variance implies. \n\n"}

A\n  Mass-Rotation Correlation at 10 Myr Abstract: Recent observations of the low-mass rotation distributions of the Pleiades\nand Praesepe clusters have revealed a ubiquitous correlation between mass and\nrotation, such that late M dwarfs rotate an order-of-magnitude faster than\nearly M dwarfs. In this paper, we demonstrate that this mass-rotation\ncorrelation is present in the 10 Myr Upper Scorpius association, as revealed by\nnew ${\\it K2}$ rotation measurements. Using rotational evolution models we show\nthat the low-mass ($0.1-0.6 M_{\\odot}$) rotation distribution of the 125 Myr\nPleiades cluster can only be produced if it hosted an equally strong\nmass-rotation correlation at 10 Myr. This suggests that physical processes\nimportant in the early pre-main sequence (star formation, accretion,\ndisk-locking) are primarily responsible for the M dwarf rotation morphology,\nand not quirks of later angular momentum evolution. Such early mass trends must\nbe taken into account when constructing initial conditions for future studies\nof stellar rotation. Finally, we show that the average M star loses $\\sim\n25-40$% of its angular momentum between 10 and 125 Myr, a figure accurately and\ngenerically predicted by modern solar-calibrated wind models.

In this paper, we show that routing can in the\nworst case result in an unbounded gap from the network capacity - or reversely,\nphysical layer cooperation can offer unbounded gains over routing.

We prove that this guarantee is\nfundamental, i.e., it is the highest worst-case guarantee that we can provide\nfor routing in relay networks. Next, we consider how these guarantees are\nrefined for Gaussian layered relay networks with $L$ layers and $N_L$ relays\nper layer.

First, in the integrated UAV WPCN, a UAV acts as a hybrid AP in which\nboth energy transfer and information reception are processed at a single UAV.\nIn contrast, for the separated UAV WPCN, we consider two UAVs each of which\nbehaves as an energy AP and an information AP independently, and thus the\nenergy transfer and the information decoding are separately performed at two\ndifferent UAVs.

Recent observations of the massive young stellar object S255 NIRS 3\nhave revealed a large increase in both methanol maser flux density and IR\nemission, which have been interpreted as the result of an accretion outburst,\npossibly due to instabilities in a circumstellar disk. This indicates that this\ntype of accretion event could be common in young/forming early-type stars and\nin their lower mass siblings, and supports the idea that accretion onto the\nstar may occur in a non-continuous way. Aims. As accretion and ejection are\nbelieved to be tightly associated phenomena, we wanted to confirm the accretion\ninterpretation of the outburst in S255 NIRS 3 by detecting the corresponding\nburst of the associated thermal jet. Methods. We monitored the radio continuum\nemission from S255 NIRS 3 at four bands using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large\nArray. The millimetre continuum emission was also observed with both the\nNorthern Extended Millimeter Array of IRAM and the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array. Results. We have detected an exponential\nincrease in the radio flux density from 6 to 45 GHz starting right after July\n10, 2016, namely about 13 months after the estimated onset of the IR outburst.\nThis is the first ever detection of a radio burst associated with an IR\naccretion outburst from a young stellar object. The flux density at all\nobserved centimetre bands can be reproduced with a simple expanding jet model.\nAt millimetre wavelengths we infer a marginal flux increase with respect to the\nliterature values and we show this is due to free-free emission from the radio\njet.

A key question in mm-wave vehicular\nnetworks is how to optimize the trade-off between directive Data Transmission\n(DT) and directional Beam Training (BT), which enables it.

In the proposed\nscenario, a Base Station (BS) uses BT to establish a mm-wave directive link\ntowards a Mobile User (MU) moving along a road. To control the BT/DT trade-off,\na Partially Observable (PO) Markov Decision Process (MDP) is formulated, where\nthe system state corresponds to the position of the MU within the road link.\nThe goal is to maximize the number of bits delivered by the BS to the MU over\nthe communication session, under a power constraint.

The vacuum $f(R)$ gravity is an example for which the variables we will\nchoose to quantify the phase space dynamics, do not necessarily blow-up near a\ncosmological singularity. After appropriately choosing the variables, we shall\ninvestigate the behavior of the corresponding dynamical system near some types\nof cosmological finite-time singularities, for some limiting cases in which we\ncan produce analytic solutions for the dynamical variables. The most\ninteresting case from both a mathematical and physical point of view, is the\nBig Rip case, and particularly in the limiting case of a very strong\nsingularity.

For the most common type of progenitors, likely with slowly rotating\ncores, the dominant GW emission mechanisms are the post-bounce oscillations of\nthe proto-neutron star (PNS) before the explosion. We present a new procedure\nto compute the eigenmodes of the system formed by the PNS and the stalled\naccretion shock in general relativity including spacetime perturbations. The\nnew method improves on previous results by accounting for perturbations of both\nthe lapse function and the conformal factor. We apply our analysis to two\nnumerical core-collapse simulations and show that our improved method is able\nto obtain eigenfrequencies that accurately match the features observed in the\nGW signal and to predict the qualitative behaviour of quasi-radial\noscillations. Our analysis is possible thanks to a newly developed algorithm to\nclassify the computed eigenmodes in different classes (f-, p-, and g-modes),\nimproving previous results which suffered from misclassification issues. We\nfind that most of the GW energy is stored in the lowest order eigenmodes, in\nparticular in the $^2g_1$ mode and in the $^2f$ mode.

We develop a fast statistical test of the null\nhypothesis that a Fourier-like power spectrum is consistent with noise. The\nnull hypothesis is rejected where the local \"coefficient of variation\"\n(CV)---the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean---in a power spectrum\ndeviates significantly from expectations for pure noise (CV~1.0 for a Chi^2\n2-degrees-of-freedom distribution). This technique is of particular utility for\ndetecting signals in power spectra with frequency-dependent noise backgrounds,\nas it is only sensitive to features that are sharp relative to the inspected\nfrequency bin width. We develop a CV-based algorithm to quickly detect the\npresence of solar-like oscillations in photometric power spectra that are\ndominated by stellar granulation. This approach circumvents the need for\nbackground fitting to measure the frequency of maximum solar-like oscillation\npower, nu_max.

The essential elements behind the phenomenon are: (i)\nscrambling which in a chaotic system makes out-of-time-ordered correlation\nfunctions (OTOCs) vanish at large times; (ii) the entanglement structure of the\nstate of the system. The latter aspect also implies that the regenesis\nphenomenon requires fine tuning of the initial state.

Early phase\nobservations in optical to NIR wavelengths of type Ia supernovae also reveal\nunusual properties of dust extinction and dust polarization.

The question of why small grains are predominant in these environments\nremains a mystery. Here we report a new mechanism of dust destruction based on\ncentrifugal stress within extremely fast-rotating grains spun-up by radiative\ntorques, which we term the RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD) mechanism.

We study the appearance of activity signatures in contemporaneous\nphotometric and chromospheric time series. Lomb-Scargle periodograms are used\nto search for cycle periods present in both time series. To emphasize the\nsignature of the activity cycle we account for rotation-induced scatter in both\ndata sets by fitting a quasi-periodic Gaussian process model to each observing\nseason. After subtracting the rotational variability, cycle amplitudes and the\nphase difference between the two time series are obtained by fitting both time\nseries simultaneously using the same cycle period. We find cycle periods in 27\nof the 30 stars in our sample. The phase difference between the two time series\nreveals that the variability in fast rotating active stars is usually in\nanti-phase, while the variability of slowly rotating inactive stars is in\nphase. The photometric cycle amplitudes are on average six times larger for the\nactive stars. The phase and amplitude information demonstrates that active\nstars are dominated by dark spots, whereas less active stars are dominated by\nbright faculae. We find the transition from spot to faculae domination at the\nVaughan-Preston gap, and around a Rossby number equal to one. We conclude that\nfaculae are the dominant ingredient of stellar activity cycles at ages >2.55\nGyr. The data further suggest that the Vaughan-Preston gap can not explain the\npreviously detected dearth of Kepler rotation periods between 15-25 days.\nNevertheless, our results led us to propose an explanation for the rotation\nperiod dearth to be due to the non-detection of periodicity caused by the\ncancellation of dark spots and bright faculae at 800 Myr. \n\n"}

In\nthe IR such amplitude leads to g = 2 for arbitrary charged spin states, and the\nbest high energy behavior for a given spin. We proceed to construct the\n(gravitational) Compton amplitude for generic spins. We find that the leading\ndeformation away from minimal coupling, in the gravitation sector, will lead to\ninconsistent factorizations and are thus forbidden. As the corresponding\ndeformation in the gauge sector encodes the anomalous magnetic dipole moment,\nthis leads to the prediction that for systems with gauge2 =gravity relations,\nsuch as perturbative string theory, all charged states must have g = 2. It is\nthen natural to ask for generic spin, what is the theory that yields such\nminimal coupling. By matching to the one body effective action, remarkably we\nverify that for large spins, the answer is Kerr black holes. This\nidentification is then an on-shell avatar of the no hair theorem.

Thus, all low-frequency ion\nheating in such plasmas is due to compressive fluctuations (\"slow modes\").\nBecause these fluctuations energetically decouple from the Alfv\\'enic ones\nalready in the inertial range, the above conclusion means that the energy\npartition between ions and electrons in low-beta plasmas is decided at the\nouter scale, where turbulence is launched, and can be determined from\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the relevant astrophysical systems. Any\nadditional ion heating must come from non-gyrokinetic mechanisms such as\ncyclotron heating or the stochastic heating owing to distortions of ions'\nLarmor orbits. An exception to these conclusions occurs in the Hall limit,\ni.e., when the ratio of the ion to electron temperatures is as low as the ion\nbeta (equivalently, the electron beta is order unity). In this regime, slow\nmodes couple to Alfv\\'enic ones well above the Larmor scale (viz., at the ion\ninertial or ion sound scale), so the Alfv\\'enic and compressive cascades join\nand then separate again into two cascades of fluctuations that linearly\nresemble kinetic Alfv\\'en and ion cyclotron waves, with the former heating\nelectrons and the latter ions.

These fluctuations can be described by the\nEinstein-Langevin equation obtained in the framework of stochastic gravity.\nSpecifically, the Einstein-Langevin equation yields stochastic correlation\nfunctions for the metric perturbations which agree, to leading order in the\nlarge $N$ limit, with the quantum correlation functions of the theory of\ngravity interacting with $N$ matter fields. The homogeneous solutions of the\nEinstein-Langevin equation are equivalent to the solutions of the perturbed\nsemiclassical equation, which describe the evolution of the expectation value\nof the quantum metric perturbations. The information on the intrinsic\nfluctuations, which are connected to the initial fluctuations of the metric\nperturbations, can also be retrieved entirely from the homogeneous solutions.\nHowever, the induced metric fluctuations proportional to the noise kernel can\nonly be obtained from the Einstein-Langevin equation (the inhomogeneous term).\nThese equations exhibit runaway solutions with exponential instabilities.

The implicit appeal to insufficient\nreason shows that quantum probabilities are not more objective than classical\nprobabilities. Previously we had argued that the consistent manipulation of\namplitudes leads to a linear time evolution; our second result is that time\nevolution must also be unitary. The argument is straightforward and hinges on\nthe conservation of entropy. The only subtlety consists of defining the correct\nentropy; it is the array entropy, not von Neumann's. After unitary evolution\nhas been established we proceed to introduce the useful notion of observables\nand we explore how von Neumann's entropy can be linked to Shannon's information\ntheory. Finally, we discuss how various connections among the postulates of\nquantum theory are made explicit within this approach. \n\n"}
