Particle\ninterferometry might then reveal non-standard decoherence effects, in addition\nto standard ones (due to, e.g., finite source size and detector resolution.) In\nthis work we discuss the phenomenology of such non-standard effects in the\npropagation of electron neutrinos in the Sun and in the long-baseline reactor\nexperiment KamLAND, which jointly provide us with the best available probes of\ndecoherence at neutrino energies E ~ few MeV. In the solar neutrino case, by\nmeans of a perturbative approach, decoherence is shown to modify the standard\n(adiabatic) propagation in matter through a calculable damping factor. By\nassuming a power-law dependence of decoherence effects in the energy domain\n(E^n with n = 0,+/-1,+/-2), theoretical predictions for two-family neutrino\nmixing are compared with the data and discussed.

In the braneworld scenario, the four dimensional effective Einstein\nequation has some extra terms, called dark radiation and dark pressure,\nrespectively, which arise from the embedding of the 3-brane in the bulk. To\nderive the generalized virial theorem we use a method based on the\ncollisionless Boltzmann equation. The dark radiation term generates an\nequivalent mass term (the dark mass), which gives an effective contribution to\nthe gravitational energy. This term may account for the well-known virial\ntheorem mass discrepancy in actual clusters of galaxies. An approximate\nsolution of the vacuum field equations on the brane, corresponding to weak\ngravitational fields, is also obtained, and the expressions for the dark\nradiation and dark mass are derived.

Various other experimental\nresults seem to point in the same direction: For instance, localized wavelet-\ntype solutions to Maxwell equations have been found, both theoretically and\nexperimentally, that travel with superluminal speed. [Even muonic and\nelectronic neutrinos [it has been proposed] might be \"tachyons\", since their\nsquare mass appears to be negative]. With regard to the first-mentioned\nexperiments, it was recently claimed by Guenter Nimtz that those results with\nevanescent waves (or tunneling photons) imply superluminal signal and impulse\ntransmission, and therefore violate Einstein causality. In this note we want to\nstress that, on the contrary, all such results do not place relativistic\ncausality in jeopardy, even if they referred to actual tachyonic motions: In\nfact, Special Relativity can cope even with superluminal objects and waves. For\ninstance, it is possible (at least in microphysics) to solve also the known\ncausal paradoxes, devised for faster than light motion, although this is not\nwidely recognized yet.

These phenomena shall be described\nand exemplified by computer simulations of the Asakura-Oosawa model for\ncolloid-polymer mixtures, but applications to other soft matter systems (e.g.\nconfined polymer blends) will also be mentioned. Typically a wall will prefer\none of the phases, and hence the composition of the system in the direction\nperpendicular to the walls will not be homogeneous. If both walls are of the\nsame kind, this effect leads to a distortion of the phase diagram of the system\nin thin film geometry, in comparison with the bulk, analogous to the phenomenon\nof \"capillary condensation\" of simple fluids in thin capillaries. In the case\nof \"competing walls\", where both walls prefer different phases of the two\nphases coexisting in the bulk, a state with an interface parallel to the walls\ngets stabilized.

Recently, there has been growing interest in nonlinear but structured\nsignal models, in which $x$ lies in a union of subspaces. In this paper we\ndevelop a general framework for robust and efficient recovery of such signals\nfrom a given set of samples. More specifically, we treat the case in which $x$\nlies in a sum of $k$ subspaces, chosen from a larger set of $m$ possibilities.\nThe samples are modelled as inner products with an arbitrary set of sampling\nfunctions. To derive an efficient and robust recovery algorithm, we show that\nour problem can be formulated as that of recovering a block-sparse vector whose\nnon-zero elements appear in fixed blocks.

The reduced models are obtained using an\napproximate balanced truncation method that retains the most controllable and\nobservable modes of the system. The original method is valid only for stable\nlinear systems, and we present an extension to unstable linear systems. The\ndynamics on the unstable subspace are represented by projecting the original\nequations onto the global unstable eigenmodes, assumed to be small in number. A\nsnapshot-based algorithm is developed, using approximate balanced truncation,\nfor obtaining a reduced-order model of the dynamics on the stable subspace. The\nproposed algorithm is used to study feedback control of 2-D flow over a flat\nplate at a low Reynolds number and at large angles of attack, where the natural\nflow is vortex shedding, though there also exists an unstable steady state. For\ncontrol design, we derive reduced-order models valid in the neighborhood of\nthis unstable steady state.

Considerations of cosmology in the BIMOND framework suggest that such\nTM might exist and copy matter in its attributes. Here I investigate the\nindirect interactions that BIMOND theories predict between nonrelativistic\nmasses of matter and TM. The most salient result is that in the deep-MOND\nregime of the matter-TM-symmetric theories, TM behaves as if it has a negative\ngravitational mass. To wit, interaction within each sector is attractive MOND\ngravity, but between matter and TM it is repulsive MOND gravity. In the\nhigh-acceleration regime, the interaction depends on a parameter, beta. For the\nfavored value beta=1, matter and TM do not interact in this regime; for beta<1\nthey attract; and for beta>1 they repel each other. Such interactions may have\nsubstantial ramifications for all aspects of structure formation, such as\nmatter distribution, peculiar velocities, and effects on the CMB.

It assumes that individuals (operators) governing the dynamics of a\ncertain system try to follow an optimal strategy in controlling its motion but\nfail to do this perfectly because similar strategies are indistinguishable for\nthem. The main attention is focused on the systems where the optimal dynamics\nimplies the stability of a certain equilibrium point in the corresponding phase\nspace. In such systems the fuzzy rationality gives rise to some neighborhood of\nthe equilibrium point, the region of dynamical traps, wherein each point is\nregarded as an equilibrium one by the operators. So when the system enters this\nregion and while it is located in it, maybe for a long time, the operator\ncontrol is suspended. To elucidate a question as to whether the dynamical traps\non their own can cause emergent phenomena the stochastic factors are eliminated\nfrom consideration. In this case the system can leave the dynamical trap region\nonly because of the mismatch between actions of different operators. By way of\nexample, a chain of oscillators with dynamical traps is analyzed numerically.\nAs demonstrated the dynamical traps do induce instability and complex behavior\nof such systems. \n\n"}

The non-depolarized intensity autocorrelation function, measured at\nlow scattering wavenumbers, consists of a fast and a slowly decaying mode which\nwe interpret as the orientationally averaged collective and translational\nself-diffusion coefficients, respectively. Both the rotational and the\nlong-time self-diffusion coefficients decrease very strongly, by more than two\norders of magnitude, in going from the very dilute limit to the I/LC transition\nconcentration.

In this limit, we show that an adiabatic reduction (or\nstochastic averaging) of the dynamics can be performed. We then obtain a\nkinetic equation that describes the slow evolution of zonal jets over a very\nlong time scale, where the effect of non-zonal turbulence has been integrated\nout. The main theoretical difficulty, achieved in this work, is to analyze the\nstationary distribution of a Lyapunov equation that describes quasi-Gaussian\nfluctuations around each zonal jet, in the inertial limit.

We introduce a\nmodel for self-propelled rods in two dimensions that interact via a\nseparation-shifted Lennard-Jones potential. Due to the finite potential\nbarrier, the rods are able to cross.

The\nnewfound wealth of rich sources of data---including banknote flows, mobile\nphone records, and transportation data---has led to an explosion of attempts to\ncharacterize modern human mobility. Unfortunately, the dearth of comparable\nhistorical data makes it much more difficult to study human mobility patterns\nfrom the past. In this paper, we present an analysis of long-term human\nmigration, which is important for processes such as urbanization and the spread\nof ideas. We demonstrate that the data record from Korean family books (called\n\"jokbo\") can be used to estimate migration patterns via marriages from the past\n750 years. We apply two generative models of long-term human mobility to\nquantify the relevance of geographical information to human marriage records in\nthe data, and we find that the wide variety in the geographical distributions\nof the clans poses interesting challenges for the direct application of these\nmodels. Using the different geographical distributions of clans, we quantify\nthe \"ergodicity\" of clans in terms of how widely and uniformly they have spread\nacross Korea, and we compare these results to those obtained using surname data\nfrom the Czech Republic.

In this paper, the dependence of stochastic Turing\npatterns on the compartment size is investigated.

Guided by\nthis universal feature, physicists have proposed that solely alignment rules at\nthe individual level could account for the emergence of unidirectional motion\nat the group level. This hypothesis has been supported by agent-based\nsimulations. However, more complex collective behaviors have been\nsystematically found in experiments including the formation of vortices,\nfluctuating swarms, clustering and swirling. All these model systems\npredominantly rely on actual collisions to display collective motion. As a\nresult, the potential local alignment rules are entangled with more complex,\noften unknown, interactions. The large-scale behavior of the populations\ntherefore depends on these uncontrolled microscopic couplings. Here, we\ndemonstrate a new phase of active matter.

This\nstochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) is used as a test case to\nunderstand, how numerical continuation methods can be carried over to the SPDE\nsetting. First, we compute the deterministic bifurcation diagram for the PDE,\ni.e. without stochastic forcing. In this case, two locally asymptotically\nstable steady state solution branches exist upon variation of the linear\ndamping term. Then we consider the Lyapunov operator equation for the locally\nlinearized system around steady states for the SPDE. We discretize the full\nSPDE using a combination of finite-differences and spectral noise approximation\nobtaining a finite-dimensional system of stochastic ordinary differential\nequations (SODEs). The large system of SODEs is used to approximate the\nLyapunov operator equation via covariance matrices. The covariance matrices are\nnumerically continued along the two bifurcation branches. We show that we can\nquantify the stochastic fluctuations along the branches. We also demonstrate\nscaling laws near branch and fold bifurcation points. Furthermore, we perform\ncomputational tests to show that, even with a sub-optimal computational setup,\nwe can quantify the subexponential-timescale fluctuations near the\ndeterministic steady states upon stochastic forcing on a standard desktop\ncomputer setup.

We may think of individuals as beginning inactive and becoming\nactive after contact with a sufficient number of active partners.

We adapt techniques\ndeveloped for infectious disease modeling to develop and analyze analytic\nmodels for the dynamics of the WTM in Configuration Model networks and a class\nof random clustered (triangle-based) networks. The resulting model is\nrelatively simple and compact. We use it to gain insights into the contagion\ndynamics.

An important open question is whether this is a\nresult of evolutionary optimization or a universal feature of life. In the\nlatter case, the origin of life would be coincident with a shift in\nenvironmental conditions. Here we present a model for the emergence of life in\nwhich replicators are explicitly coupled to their environment through the\nrecycling of a finite supply of resources. The model exhibits a dynamic,\nfirst-order phase transition from non-life to \"life,\" where the life phase is\ndistinguished by selection on replicators. We show that environmental coupling\nplays an important role in the dynamics of the transition. The transition\ncorresponds to a redistribution of matter in replicators and their environment,\ndriven by selection on replicators, exhibiting an explosive growth in diversity\nas replicators are selected. The transition is accurately tracked by the mutual\ninformation shared between replicators and their environment. In the absence of\nsuccessfully repartitioning system resources, the transition fails to complete,\nleading to the possibility of many frustrated trials before life first emerges.\nOften, the replicators that initiate the transition are not those that are\nultimately selected. The results are consistent with the view that life's\npropensity to shape its environment is indeed a universal feature of\nreplicators, characteristic of the transition from non-life to life.

In biosensors, a key factor\ndetermining the sensitivity and thus the performance of the device is the\norientation of the ligand molecules on the bioactive device surface. Adsorption\nstudies thus seek to determine how orientation can be influenced by surface\npreparation. In this work, protein orientation near charged nanosurfaces is\nobtained under electrostatic effects using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, in\nan implicit-solvent model. Sampling the free energy for protein GB1D4' at a\nrange of tilt and rotation angles with respect to the charged surface, we\ncalculated the probability of the protein orientations and observed a dipolar\nbehavior. This result is consistent with published experimental studies and\ncombined Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations using this small\nprotein, validating our method.

New\nalgorithms must be developed which minimise the transfer of data. Patch\ndynamics is a computational macroscale modelling scheme which provides a coarse\nmacroscale solution of a problem defined on a fine microscale by dividing the\ndomain into many nonoverlapping, coupled patches.

In this way we can vary the degree of turbulence helicity from non\nhelical to maximally helical. We find that increasing the rate of helicity\ninjection does not change the energy flux. On the other hand the level of total\nenergy is strongly increased and the energy spectrum gets steeper. The energy\nspectrum spans from a Kolmogorov scaling law $k^{-5/3}$ for a non-helical\nturbulence, to a non-Kolmogorov scaling law $k^{-7/3}$ for a maximally helical\nturbulence. In the later case we find that the characteristic time of the\nturbulence is not the turnover time but a time based on the helicity injection\nrate. We also analyse the results in terms of helical modes decomposition.

Our approach is\nbased on a mapping for opera- tors in Fock space that allows a compact and\nefficient application of the Hamiltonian and solution of the MCTDHF equations\nof motion. Our implementation extends, builds on and exploits the recursive\nimplementation of MCTDH for bosons (R-MCTDHB) package. Together with R-MCTDHB,\nthe present implementation of MCTDHF forms the MCTDH-X package. We benchmark\nthe accuracy of the algorithm with the harmonic interaction model and a\ntime-dependent generalization thereof. These models consider parabolically\ntrapped particles that interact through a harmonic interaction potential. We\ndemonstrate, that MCTDHF is capable of solving the time-dependent many-fermion\nSchr\\\"odinger equation to an in principle arbitrary degree of precision and can\nhence yield numerically exact results even in the case of Hamiltonians with\ntime-dependent one-body and two-body potentials.

Recently, a physics-based, nonparametric approach for quantifying\nmodel-form uncertainty in RANS simulations has been proposed, where Reynolds\nstresses are projected to physically meaningful dimensions and perturbations\nare introduced only in the physically realizable limits. However, a challenge\nassociated with this approach is to assess the amount of information introduced\nin the prior distribution and to avoid imposing unwarranted constraints. In\nthis work we propose a random matrix approach for quantifying model-form\nuncertainties in RANS simulations with the realizability of the Reynolds stress\nguaranteed. Furthermore, the maximum entropy principle is used to identify the\nprobability distribution that satisfies the constraints from available\ninformation but without introducing artificial constraints. We demonstrate that\nthe proposed approach is able to ensure the realizability of the Reynolds\nstress, albeit in a different manner from the physics-based approach. Monte\nCarlo sampling of the obtained probability distribution is achieved by using\npolynomial chaos expansion to map independent Gaussian random fields to the\nReynolds stress random field with the marginal distributions and correlation\nstructures as specified. Numerical simulations on a typical flow with\nseparation have shown physically reasonable results, which verifies the\nproposed approach. Therefore, the proposed method is a promising alternative to\nthe physics-based approach for model-form uncertainty quantification of RANS\nsimulations. The method explored in this work is general and can be extended to\nother complex physical systems in applied mechanics and engineering. \n\n"}

The basic idea is to lift the nonlinear dynamics into a\nhigher dimensional space where its evolution is approximately linear. In an\nuncontrolled setting, this procedure amounts to a numerical approximation of\nthe Koopman operator associated to the nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we\nextend the Koopman operator to controlled dynamical systems and compute a\nfinite-dimensional approximation of the operator in such a way that this\napproximation has the form a linear controlled dynamical system. In numerical\nexamples, the linear predictors obtained in this way exhibit a performance\nsuperior to existing linear predictors such as those based on local\nlinearization or the so-called Carleman linearization. Importantly, the\nprocedure to construct these linear predictors is completely data-driven and\nextremely simple -- it boils down to a nonlinear transformation of the data\n(the lifting) and a linear least squares problem in the lifted space that can\nbe readily solved for large data sets. These linear predictors can be readily\nused to design controllers for the nonlinear dynamical system using linear\ncontroller design methodologies.

The main advantage of this kind\nof approach is the easy implementation and stability enhancement by introducing\nmore middle stages. However, the nth-order time accuracy needs no less than n\nstages for the RK method, which is very time and memory consuming for a high\norder method. On the other hand, the multi-stage multi-derivative (MSMD) method\ncan be used to achieve the same order of time accuracy using less middle\nstages, once the time derivatives of the flux function is used.The gas kinetic\nscheme (GKS) provides such a time accurate evolution model. By combining the\nsecond-order or third-order GKS flux functions with the MSMD technique, a\nfamily of high order gas kinetic methods can be constructed. As an extension of\nthe previous 2-stage 4th-order GKS, the 5th-order schemes with 2 and 3 stages\nwill be developed in this paper. Based on the same 5th-order WENO\nreconstruction, the performance of gas kinetic schemes from the 2nd- to the\n5th-order time accurate methods will be evaluated. The results show that the\n5th-order scheme can achieve the theoretical order of accuracy for the Euler\nequations, and present accurate Navier-Stokes solutions as well due to the\ncoupling of inviscid and viscous terms in the GKS formulation.

The warped 5D model can\nbe reformulated by considering the warp factor as a dilaton field ($\\omega$)\nconformally coupled to gravity and embedded in a smooth $M_4 \\otimes R$\nmanifold. On the brane, where the U(1) scalar gauge fields live, the dilaton\nfield manifests itself classically as a warp factor and enters the evolution\nequations for the metric components and matter fields. We write the Lagrangian\nfor the Einstein-scalar gauge fields in a conformal invariant setting. However,\nas expected, the conformal invariance is broken (trace-anomaly) by the\nappearance of a mass term and a quadratic term in the energy-momentum tensor of\nthe scalar gauge field, arising from the extrinsic curvature terms in the\nprojected Einstein tensor. These terms can be interpreted as a constraint in\norder to maintain conformal invariance. By considering the dilaton field and\nHiggs field on equal footing on small scales, there will be no singular\nbehavior, when $\\omega\\rightarrow 0$ and one can deduce constraints to maintain\nregularity of the action. Our conjecture is that $\\omega$, alias warp factor,\nhas a dual meaning.

(2) Introducing a new type of restricted integer partition\nfunctions corresponding to general statistics which is a generalization of\nGentile statistics in statistical mechanics; many kinds of restricted integer\npartition functions are special cases of this restricted integer partition\nfunction. Moreover, with statistical mechanics as a bridge, we reveals a\nmathematical fact: the generating function of restricted integer partition\nfunction is just the symmetric function which is a class of functions being\ninvariant under the action of permutation groups. Using the approach, we\nprovide some expressions of restricted integer partition functions as examples. \n\n"}

RAVE involves iterations between molecular simulations and deep\nlearning in order to produce an increasingly accurate probability distribution\nalong a low-dimensional latent space that captures the key features of the\nmolecular simulation trajectory. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between\nthis latent space distribution and the distribution of various trial reaction\ncoordinates sampled from the molecular simulation, RAVE determines an optimum,\nyet nonetheless physically interpretable, reaction coordinate and optimum\nprobability distribution. Both then directly serve as the biasing protocol for\na new biased simulation, which is once again fed into the deep learning module\nwith appropriate weights accounting for the bias, the procedure continuing\nuntil estimates of desirable thermodynamic observables are converged.

The methods rely on auxiliary functionals, which\nare similar to Lyapunov functionals but satisfy different inequalities. The\ninequalities are enforced by requiring certain expressions to be sums of\nsquares of polynomials, and the optimal choice of auxiliary functional is posed\nas a semidefinite program (SDP) that can be solved computationally. To\nformulate these SDPs we approximate the PDE by truncated systems of ODEs and\nproceed in one of two ways. The first approach is to compute bounds for the ODE\nsystems, increasing the truncation order until bounds converge numerically. The\nsecond approach incorporates the ODE systems with analytical estimates on their\ndeviation from the PDE, thereby using finite truncations to produce bounds for\nthe full PDE. We apply both methods to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, where\nwe compute upper bounds on the spatiotemporal average of energy by employing\npolynomial auxiliary functionals up to degree six. The first approach is used\nfor most computations, but a subset of results are checked using the second\napproach, and the results agree to high precision. These bounds apply to all\nodd solutions of period $2\\pi L$, where $L$ is varied. Sharp bounds are\nobtained for $L\\le10$, and trends suggest that more expensive computations\nwould yield sharp bounds at larger $L$ also. The bounds are known to be sharp\n(to within 0.1% numerical error) because they are saturated by the simplest\nnonzero steady states, which apparently have the largest mean energy among all\nodd solutions. Prior authors have conjectured that mean energy remains $O(1)$\nfor $L\\gg1$ since no particular solutions with larger energy have been found.\nOur bounds constitute the first positive evidence for this conjecture, albeit\nup to finite $L$, and they offer some guidance for analytical proofs. \n\n"}

Such a\npair of Ising models can be interpreted as a two-chain complex with $k$ being\nthe rank of the first homology group. Our focus is on the case where $k$ is\nextensive, that is, scales linearly with the number of bonds $n$. Flipping any\nof these additional spins introduces a homologically non-trivial defect\n(generalized domain wall). In the presence of bond disorder, we prove the\nexistence of a low-temperature weak-disorder region where additional summation\nover the defects have no effect on the free energy density $f(T)$ in the\nthermodynamical limit, and of a high-temperature region where in the\nferromagnetic case an extensive homological defect does not affect $f(T)$.

Progress has been hampered by technical problems\nwhich have plagued the study of the crystalline systems using the most\nsophisticated Fundamental Measure Theory models. In this paper, the reasons for\nthe difficulties are examined and it is proposed that the tensor functionals\ncurrently favored are in fact numerically unstable. By reverting to an older,\nmore heuristic model it is shown that all of the technical difficulties are\neliminated. Application to a Lennard-Jones fluid results in a demonstration of\npower of ftDFT to describe crystallization in a highly inhomogeneous system.\nFirst, we show that droplets attached to a slightly hydrophobic wall\ncrystallize spontaneously upon being quenched. The resulting crystallites are\nclearly faceted structures and are predominantly HCP structures. In contrast,\ndroplets in a fully periodic calculational cell remain stable to lower\ntemperatures and eventually show the same spontaneous localization of the\ndensity into 'atoms' but in an amorphous structure having many of the\nstructural charactersitics of a glass. A small change of the protocol leads, at\nthe same temperature, to the formation of crystals, this time with the FCC\nstructure typical of bulk Lennard-Jones solids. The FCC crystals have lower\nfree energy than the amorphous structures which in turn are more stable than\nthe liquid droplets. It is demonstrated that as the temperature is raised, the\nfree energy differences between the structures decreases until the solid\nclusters become less stable than the liquid droplets and spontaneously melt.\nThe presence of energy barriers separating the various structures is therefore\nclearly demonstrated. \n\n"}

Considering the\nion-acoustic regime, both constituents of the plasma, i.e. electrons and ions\nare treated following their distribution functions in these set of fully\nkinetic simulations.

In particular, simulations showed that $\\left\\langle\nf\\right\\rangle $, the average fraction of cross-links between the two groups\n(which serves as an 'order parameter' here), jumps dramatically when $\\Delta\n\\equiv N_{I}-N_{E}$ crosses the 'critical point' $\\Delta _{c}=0$, as in typical\nfirst order transitions. Yet, at criticality, there is no phase co-existence,\nbut the fluctuations of $f$ are much larger than in typical second order\ntransitions. Indeed, it was conjectured that, in the thermodynamic limit, both\nthe jump and the fluctuations become maximal, so that the system is said to\ndisplay an 'extreme Thouless effect.'

The\nbackward reachable set is a set of states, from which all trajectories starting\nwill surely enter a target region at the end of a given time horizon without\nviolating a set of state constraints in spite of the actions of uncertainties.\nIt is equal to the zero sub-level set of the unique Lipschitz viscosity\nsolution to a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation (HJE). We show that\ninner-approximations of the backward reachable set can be formed by zero\nsub-level sets of its viscosity super-solutions.

We consider two\ntypes of angled Hele-Shaw cells: diverging cells with a positive depth gradient\nand converging cells with a negative depth gradient, and compare those against\nparallel cells without a depth gradient. A modified linear stability analysis\nis employed to derive an expression for the growth rate of perturbations on the\ninterface and for the critical capillary number ($Ca_c$) for such tapered\nHele-Shaw cells with small gap gradients. Based on this new expression for\n$Ca_c$, a three-regime theory is formulated to describe the interface\n(in)stability: (i) in Regime I, the growth rate is always negative, thus the\ninterface is stable; (ii) in Regime II, the growth rate remains zero (parallel\ncells), changes from negative to positive (converging cells), or from positive\nto negative (diverging cells), thus the interface (in)stability possibly\nchanges type at some location in the cell; (iii) in Regime III, the growth rate\nis always positive, thus the interface is unstable.

Abstract: We analytically study the dynamics of evolving populations that exhibit\nmetastability on the level of phenotype or fitness. In constant selective\nenvironments, such metastable behavior is caused by two qualitatively different\nmechanisms. One the one hand, populations may become pinned at a local fitness\noptimum, being separated from higher-fitness genotypes by a {\\em fitness\nbarrier} of low-fitness genotypes. On the other hand, the population may only\nbe metastable on the level of phenotype or fitness while, at the same time,\ndiffusing over {\\em neutral networks} of selectively neutral genotypes.\nMetastability occurs in this case because the population is separated from\nhigher-fitness genotypes by an {\\em entropy barrier}: The population must\nexplore large portions of these neutral networks before it discovers a rare\nconnection to fitter phenotypes.\n  We derive analytical expressions for the barrier crossing times in both the\nfitness barrier and entropy barrier regime. In contrast with ``landscape''\nevolutionary models, we show that the waiting times to reach higher fitness\ndepend strongly on the width of a fitness barrier and much less on its height.\nThe analysis further shows that crossing entropy barriers is faster by orders\nof magnitude than fitness barrier crossing. Thus, when populations are trapped\nin a metastable phenotypic state, they are most likely to escape by crossing an\nentropy barrier, along a neutral path in genotype space. If no such escape\nroute along a neutral path exists, a population is most likely to cross a\nfitness barrier where the barrier is {\\em narrowest}, rather than where the\nbarrier is shallowest. \n\n"}

In such a way, we derive new explicit symplectic Forest-Ruth- and\nSuzuki-like integrators and present them in time-reversible velocity and\nposition forms.

Second, even in\nthe absence of a trapping potential (homogeneous gas in a box), temperature\nshifts are introduced by the interactions; they arise from the correlations\nintroduced in the gas, and thus lie inherently beyond mean field theory - in\nfact, their evaluation requires more elaborate, non-perturbative, calculations.\nOne illustration of this non-perturbative character is provided by the solution\nof self-consistent equations, which relate together non-linearly the various\nenergy shifts of the single particle levels k.

Our grid is locally translation and rotation invariant in the\nmean.

In this example, the lattice is a direct representation of the `free\npath space' of the medium. Subsequently, transport is defined as simply moving\nparticles from one node to the next, interactions taking place at each point.\nWe derive the statistical properties of such lattices, describe the limiting\nbehavior, and show how interactions are incorporated as global coefficients.\nTwo elementary linear transport problems are discussed: that of free ballistic\ntransport, and the transport of particles through a scattering medium. We also\nmention a combination of these two.

The plan is to use the microscopic\nrules restricted to small \"patches\" of the domain, the \"teeth'', using\ninterpolation to bridge the \"gaps\". Here we explore general boundary conditions\ncoupling the widely separated ``teeth'' of the microscopic simulation that\nachieve high order accuracy over the macroscale. We present the simplest case\nwhen the microscopic simulator is the quintessential example of a partial\ndifferential equation. We argue that classic high-order interpolation of the\nmacroscopic field provides the correct forcing in whatever boundary condition\nis required by the microsimulator. Such interpolation leads to Tooth Boundary\nConditions which achieve arbitrarily high-order consistency. The high-order\nconsistency is demonstrated on a class of linear partial differential equations\nin two ways: firstly through the eigenvalues of the scheme for selected\nnumerical problems; and secondly using the dynamical systems approach of\nholistic discretisation on a general class of linear \\textsc{pde}s.

When applied to patches of\nmicroscopic simulations these tooth boundary conditions promise efficient\nmacroscale simulation.

The\nlatter case implies that a node can only be reached after visiting previously a\nset of nodes (the required conditions). The process of knowledge acquisition\ncan then be simulated by considering the number of nodes visited as a single\nagent moves along the network, starting from its lowest layer.

In order to avoid deadlocks, i.e. unreachable\nnodes, the subnetwork in each layer is assumed to be a connected component.\nSeveral configurations of such hierarchical knowledge networks are simulated\nand the performance of the moving agent quantified in terms of the percentage\nof visited nodes after each movement.

We elaborate on Lorentz'\ndescription by means of electric and magnetic field strengths, whose governing\nequations separate into two fully relativistic Maxwell systems--one describing\nordinary electromagnetism, and the other describing a universally attractive or\nrepulsive long-range force. If such a force cannot be ruled out {\\it a priori}\nby known physical principles, its magnitude should be determined or bounded\nexperimentally. Were it to exist, interesting possibilities go beyond Lorentz'\nearly conjecture of a relation to (Newtonian) gravity. \n\n"}

Both laws are independent of the metric and the\nlinear connection of spacetime. Within the framework of such a premetric\nelectrodynamics -- provided a local and linear constitutive law of the vacuum\nis added -- the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the geometric-optics\nlimit can be studied. The wave vectors of the wave fronts obey a quartic\nextended Fresnel equation. If one forbids birefringence in vacuum, the light\ncone emerges and Maxwell-Lorentz vacuum electrodynamics can be recovered. If\nminimal coupling of electrodynamics to gravity is assumed, then only the\ngravitational potential, i.e., the metric of spacetime, emerges in the\nconstitutive law. We discuss recent results within this general framework. \n\n"}

It may be realized in\nthe co-transmission of fundamental-frequency (FF) and second-harmonic (SH)\nwaves in a planar optical waveguide via a long-period modulation of the usual\nquasi-phase-matching pattern of ferroelectric domains. The MM may also be\nimplemented by dint of the Feshbach resonance in a harmonically-modulated\nmagnetic field in a hybrid atomic-molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC),\nwith the atomic and molecular mean fields (MFs) playing the roles of the FF and\nSH, respectively. The problem is analyzed by two methods. First, we identify\nstability regions for spatial solitons in the MM system, in terms of the MM\namplitude and period, using the MF equations for spatially-inhomogeneous\nconfigurations. In particular, an instability enclave is found inside the\nstability area.The robustness of the solitons is also tested against variation\nof the shape of the input pulse, and a threshold for the formation of stable\nsolitons is found in terms of its power. Interactions between solitons are\nvirtually unaffected by the MM. The second method (\\textit{parametric\napproximation}), going beyond the MF description, is developed for\nspatially-homogeneous states. It demonstrates that the MF description is valid\nfor large modulation periods, while at smaller periods the non-MF component\nacquires gain, which implies destruction of MF under the action of the\nhigh-frequency MM. \n\n"}

In this paper we try to understand things as if the\nvisible universe were a reading of a low-dimensional hologram generated in\nhyperspace. We performed the whole process of creating and reading the hologram\nof a point in virtual space by using computer simulations. We claim that the\nfuzzieness in quantum mechanics, in statistical physics and thermodynamics is\ndue to the fact that we do not see the real image of the object, but a\nholographic projection of it. We found that the projection of a point particle\nis a de Broglie-type wave. This indicates that holography could be the origin\nof the wave nature of a particle. We have also noted that one cannot stabilize\nthe noise (or fuzzieness) in terms of the integration grid-points of the\nhologram, it means that one needs to give the grid-points a physical\nsignificance. So we further claim that the space is quantized, which supports\nthe basic assumption of quantum gravity. Our study in the paper, although it is\nmore qualitative, yet gives a smoking gun hint of a holographic basis of\nphysical reality. \n\n"}

Among\nthe common factors mentioned in the arbitrage pricing model (APM), widely\nacknowledged in the financial field, a representative market index is\nestablished as a possible factor. We found that the correlation distribution,\n$\\rho_{ij}$, of 400 stocks taken from the S&P500 index shows a very similar\nwith that of the Korean stock market and those deviate from the correlation\ndistribution of time series removed a nonlinearity by the surrogate method. We\nalso shows that the degree distribution of the MSTs for both stock markets\nfollows a power-law distribution with the exponent $\\zeta \\sim$ 2.1, while the\ndegree distribution of the time series eliminated a nonlinearity follows an\nexponential distribution with the exponent, $\\delta \\sim 0.77$.

The approximation is based on an\nexponential ansatz of the transition probability for a finite time step $\\Delta\nt$, and a series expansion of the deviation of its logarithm from that of a\nGaussian distribution. Through this procedure, dubbed {\\em exponent expansion},\nthe transition probability is obtained as a power series in $\\Delta t$. This\nbecomes asymptotically exact if an increasing number of terms is included, and\nprovides remarkably accurate results even when truncated to the first few (say\n3) terms. The coefficients of such expansion can be determined\nstraightforwardly through a recursion, and involve simple one-dimensional\nintegrals.\n  We present several examples of financial interest, and we compare our results\nwith the state-of-the-art approximation of discretely sampled diffusions\n[A\\\"it-Sahalia, {\\it Journal of Finance} {\\bf 54}, 1361 (1999)]. We find that\nthe exponent expansion provides a similar accuracy in most of the cases, but a\nbetter behavior in the low-volatility regime. Furthermore the implementation of\nthe present approach turns out to be simpler.\n  Within the functional integration framework the exponent expansion allows one\nto obtain remarkably good approximations of the pricing kernels of financial\nderivatives. This is illustrated with the application to simple path-dependent\ninterest rate derivatives. Finally we discuss how these results can also be\nused to increase the efficiency of numerical (both deterministic and\nstochastic) approaches to derivative pricing. \n\n"}

In general, therefore, molecular evolution takes\nplace in a dynamic rather than a static fitness landscape. We incorporate\ndynamic replication and decay rates into the standard quasispecies theory of\nmolecular evolution, and show that for periodic time-dependencies, a system of\nevolving molecules enters a limit cycle for $t\\to\\infty$. For fast periodic\nchanges, we show that molecules adapt to the time-averaged fitness landscape,\nwhereas for slow changes they track the variations in the landscape arbitrarily\nclosely. We derive a general approximation method that allows us to calculate\nthe attractor of time-periodic landscapes, and demonstrate using several\nexamples that the results of the approximation and the limiting cases of very\nslow and very fast changes are in perfect agreement. We also discuss landscapes\nwith arbitrary time dependencies, and show that very fast changes again lead to\na system that adapts to the time-averaged landscape.

The transmissibility $T_{uv}$\n(the probability that infection of $u$ causes infection of $v$) depends on the\ninfectivity of $u$ and the susceptibility of $v$. Initially a single node is\ninfected, following which a large-scale epidemic may or may not occur. We use a\ngenerating function approach to study how heterogeneity affects the probability\nthat an epidemic occurs and, if one occurs, its attack rate (the fraction\ninfected). For fixed average transmissibility, we find upper and lower bounds\non these. An epidemic is most likely if infectivity is homogeneous and least\nlikely if the variance of infectivity is maximized. Similarly, the attack rate\nis largest if susceptibility is homogeneous and smallest if the variance is\nmaximized.
