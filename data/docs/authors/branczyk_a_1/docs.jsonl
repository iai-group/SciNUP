On the other hand, the assumptions of \\emph{signal\nlocality} plus \\emph{predictability} are also sufficient to derive Bell\ninequalities. This simple theorem, previously noted but published only\nrelatively recently by Masanes, Acin and Gisin, has fundamental implications\nnot entirely appreciated. Firstly, nothing can be concluded about the\nontological assumptions of locality or determinism independently of each other\n-- it is possible to reproduce quantum mechanics with deterministic models that\nviolate locality as well as indeterministic models that satisfy locality. On\nthe other hand, the operational assumption of signal locality is an empirically\ntestable (and well-tested) consequence of relativity. Thus Bell inequality\nviolations imply that we can trust that some events are fundamentally\n\\emph{unpredictable}, even if we cannot trust that they are indeterministic.\nThis result grounds the quantum-mechanical prohibition of arbitrarily accurate\npredictions on the assumption of no superluminal signalling, regardless of any\npostulates of quantum mechanics.

In\nparticular, it is completely unclear how several concepts from the bipartite\ncase can be generalised in a meaningful way to multipartite scenarios. In this\nwork, the main issues of multipartite entanglement detection, characterisation\nand classification are discussed.

While there are other\nforms of Bell's theorems --- which I present to explain the relation between\nJarrett-completeness, \"fragile locality\", and EPR-completeness --- I maintain\nthat Bell's two versions are the essential ones.

More precisely, the\nscheduling solution affects the quality of the achievable placement solution\ndue to resource pressures that may be created as a result of operation\nscheduling whereas the operation placement and qubit routing solutions\ninfluence the scheduling solution due to resulting distances between\npredecessor and current operations, which in turn determines routing latencies.\nThe proposed flow for the quantum physical mapper captures these dependencies\nby applying (i) a loose scheduling step, which transforms an initial quantum\ndata flow graph into one that explicitly captures the no-cloning theorem of the\nquantum computing and then performs instruction scheduling based on a modified\nforce-directed scheduling approach to minimize the resource contention and\nquantum circuit latency, (ii) a placement step, which uses timing-driven\ninstruction placement to minimize the approximate routing latencies while\nmaking iterative calls to the aforesaid force-directed scheduler to correct\nscheduling levels of quantum operations as needed, and (iii) a routing step\nthat finds dynamic values of routing latencies for the qubits.

In the spirit of Feynman's vision of a quantum\nsimulator, this has recently stimulated theoretical effort to devise schemes\nfor simulating such theories on engineered quantum-mechanical devices, with the\ndifficulty that gauge invariance and the associated local conservation laws\n(Gauss laws) need to be implemented. Here we report the first experimental\ndemonstration of a digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory, by\nrealising 1+1-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (Schwinger model) on a\nfew-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. We are interested in the real-time\nevolution of the Schwinger mechanism, describing the instability of the bare\nvacuum due to quantum fluctuations, which manifests itself in the spontaneous\ncreation of electron-positron pairs. To make efficient use of our quantum\nresources, we map the original problem to a spin model by eliminating the gauge\nfields in favour of exotic long-range interactions, which have a direct and\nefficient implementation on an ion trap architecture. We explore the Schwinger\nmechanism of particle-antiparticle generation by monitoring the mass production\nand the vacuum persistence amplitude. Moreover, we track the real-time\nevolution of entanglement in the system, which illustrates how particle\ncreation and entanglement generation are directly related. Our work represents\na first step towards quantum simulating high-energy theories with atomic\nphysics experiments, the long-term vision being the extension to real-time\nquantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. \n\n"}

Such a code is denoted by the triple\n$(n,m,p)$. It is known that $n<4^m$ for all QRACs and $n<2^m$ for classical\nRACs.

Read in the contrapositive, this hypothesis entails that any\nphysical distinctions between two experimental procedures must necessarily lead\nto a difference in their operational statistics. The results I present in this\nthesis concern the failure of this hypothesis -- a failure dubbed\n\"contextuality\" -- when one tries to embed an operational theory (such as\nquantum theory) in the ontological models framework. The Kochen-Specker theorem\ndemonstrates the failure of noncontextuality for deterministic ontological\nmodels of quantum theory, i.e., those ontological models where the\nontic/physical state of the system fixes the outcome of any projective\nmeasurement on the system in a deterministic manner. This thesis goes beyond\nthe Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem by asking what operational facts must be\nverified in experiments to conclude that Nature does not admit noncontextual\nontological models, not even indeterministic ones. This leads to\nnoncontextuality inequalities that are robust to noise in the preparations and\nmeasurements. In the particular case of quantum theory, these inequalities are\nmeaningful even when unsharp measurements (or POVMs) are allowed, a feature not\nshared by the traditional approach to KS-noncontextuality where unsharp\nmeasurements are excluded by fiat: allowing them renders even trivial POVMs\n(proportional to identity) maximally KS-contextual. The sense in which trivial\nPOVMs are indeed \"trivial\" (or \"noncontextual\") is clear in our approach: they\nare simply too noisy to lead to violation of our noncontextuality inequalities. \n\n"}

The needed computations are organized as measurement\npatterns, or simply patterns, in the 1WQC model. The entanglement operations in\na pattern can be shown by a graph which together with the set of its input and\noutput qubits is called the geometry of the pattern. Since a one-way quantum\ncomputation pattern is based on quantum measurements, which are fundamentally\nnondeterministic evolutions, there must be conditions over geometries to\nguarantee determinism. Causal flow is a sufficient and generalized flow (gflow)\nis a necessary and sufficient condition over geometries to identify a\ndependency structure for the measurement sequences in order to achieve\ndeterminism. Previously, three optimization methods have been proposed to\nsimplify 1WQC patterns which are called standardization, signal shifting and\nPauli simplification. These optimizations can be performed using measurement\ncalculus formalism by rewriting rules. However, maintaining and searching these\nrules in the library can be complicated with respect to implementation.\nMoreover, serial execution of these rules is time consuming due to executing\nmany ineffective commutation rules. To overcome this problem, in this paper, a\nnew scheme is proposed to perform optimization techniques on patterns with flow\nor gflow only based on their geometries instead of using rewriting rules.\nFurthermore, the proposed scheme obtains the maximally delayed gflow order for\ngeometries with flow. It is shown that the time complexity of the proposed\napproach is improved over the previous ones. \n\n"}

Yet, the challenge of reconstructing and verifying the quantum state\nof mechanical systems has remained a major roadblock in the field.

The\nevolution of the wave function is described in terms of the parameter $\\sigma$\nthat interpolates between sequential times $n$. For a free object we obtain a\nStueckelberg equation\n$\\frac{d}{d\\sigma}\\Psi(r_{4},\\sigma)=\\frac{ic^{2}\\hbar}{2\\langle\n\\epsilon\\rangle}\\Box\\Psi(r_{4},\\sigma)$, where $r_{4}=(r,ict)$.

The parametrization is assumed to be\nnatural, meaning that $\\frac{d}{d\\sigma}\\langle t\\rangle=1$, where $\\langle\nt\\rangle$ is the expected temporal distance between the events that define $n$\nand $n+m$. The squared rest energy $\\epsilon_{0}^{2}$ is proportional to the\neigenvalue $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ that describes a 'stationary state'\n$\\Psi(r_{4},\\sigma)=\\psi(r_{4},\\tilde{\\sigma})e^{i\\tilde{\\sigma}\\sigma}$.

The formalism thus implies that all observable objects have non-zero\nrest mass, including elementary fermions. The introduction of $n$ releases $t$,\nso that it can be treated as an observable with uncertainty $\\Delta t$. \n\n"}

Page and Wootters famously\naddressed this problem by providing a mechanism for effectively introducing\ntime evolution into this timeless cosmological picture. Their method, which is\nsometimes called the conditional probability interpretation (CPI), requires the\nidentification of an internal clock system that is meant to keep time for the\nremainder of the Universe. Most investigations into this idea employ the\nidealized limit of a non-interacting clock system, the so-called ideal clock.\nHowever, by allowing for interactions, we have found the counter-intuitive\nresult that a non-interacting clock is not necessarily the optimal choice, even\nif it is `ideal'.

The nuclear spin bath, because of its bifurcated\nevolution predicated on the electron spin up or down state, measures the\nwhich-state information of the electron spin and hence diminishes its\ncoherence. The many-body dynamics of nuclear spin bath is solved with a\npair-correlation approximation. In the relevant timescale, nuclear pair-wise\nflip-flops, as elementary excitations in the mesoscopic bath, can be mapped\ninto the precession of non-interacting pseudo-spins. Such mapping provides a\ngeometrical picture for understanding the decoherence and for devising control\nschemes. A close examination of nuclear bath dynamics reveals a wealth of\nphenomena and new possibilities of controlling the electron spin decoherence.\nFor example, when the electron spin is flipped by a $\\pi$-pulse at $\\tau$, its\ncoherence will partially recover at $\\sqrt{2}\\tau$ as a consequence of quantum\ndisentanglement from the mesoscopic bath. In contrast to the re-focusing of\ninhomogeneously broadened phases by conventional spin-echoes, the\ndisentanglement is realized through shepherding quantum evolution of the bath\nstate via control of the quantum object.

Simulating such phenomena efficiently is exceedingly difficult\nbecause of the vast size of the quantum state space involved. A major\ncomplication is caused by errors (noise) due to unwanted interactions between\nthe quantum states and the environment. Consequently, simulating quantum\ncircuits and their associated errors using the density matrix representation is\npotentially significant in many applications, but is well beyond the\ncomputational abilities of most classical simulation techniques in both time\nand memory resources. The size of a density matrix grows exponentially with the\nnumber of qubits simulated, rendering array-based simulation techniques that\nexplicitly store the density matrix intractable.

To judge\nwhether such superposition is hidden in a general state, we use an essentially\nunique index p: A pure state is macroscopically entangled if p=2, whereas it\nmay be entangled but not macroscopically if p<2. This index is directly related\nto the stability of the state. We calculate the index p for various states in\nwhich magnons are excited with various densities and wavenumbers. We find\nmacroscopically entangled states (p=2) as well as states with p=1. The former\nstates are unstable in the sense that they are unstable against some local\nmeasurements. On the other hand, the latter states are stable in the senses\nthat they are stable against local measurements and that their decoherence\nrates never exceed O(N) in any weak classical noises. For comparison, we also\ncalculate the von Neumann entropy S(N) of a subsystem composed of N/2 spins as\na measure of bipartite entanglement.

For distances much longer than the coherence length of a\ncorresponding noisy quantum channel, the fidelity of transmission is usually so\nlow that standard purification methods are not applicable. It is however\npossible to divide the channel into shorter segments that are purified\nseparately and then connected by the method of entanglement swapping. This\nmethod can be much more efficient than schemes based on quantum error\ncorrection, as it makes explicit use of two-way classical communication. An\nimportant question is how the noise, introduced by imperfect local operations\n(that constitute the protocols of purification and the entanglement swapping),\naccumulates in such a compound channel, and how it can be kept below a certain\nnoise level. To treat this problem, we first study the applicability and the\nefficiency of entanglement purification protocols in the situation of imperfect\nlocal operations. We then present a scheme that allows entanglement\npurification over arbitrary long channels and tolerates errors on the per-cent\nlevel. It requires a polynomial overhead in time, and an overhead in local\nresources that grows only logarithmically with the length of the channel. \n\n"}

An essential part of the validation process for quantum mechanics\nis the development of a coherent theory of mathematics and quantum mechanics\ntogether. Such a theory should combine mathematical logical concepts with\nquantum mechanics. That this might be possible is shown here by defining truth,\nvalidity, consistency, and completeness for a quantum mechanical version of a\nsimple classical expression enumeration machine described by Smullyan. It is\nseen that for an interpretation based on a Feynman path sum over expression\npath states, truth, consistency, and completeness have different properties\nthan for the classical system. For instance the truth of a sentence S is\ndefined only on the paths containing S. It is undefined elsewhere. Also S and\nits negation can both be true provided they appear on separate paths. This\nsatisfies the definition of consistency. It is seen that validity and\ncompleteness connect the system dynamics to the truth of the sentences. It is\nproved that validity implies consistency. The requirements of validity and\nmaximal completeness strongly restrict the possible dynamics of the system.\nAspects of the existence of a valid, maximally complete dynamics are discussed.\nAn exponentially efficient quantum computer is described that is also valid and\ncomplete. \n\n"}

Abstract: Highly excited many-particle states in quantum systems (nuclei, atoms,\nquantum dots, spin systems, quantum computers) can be ``chaotic''\nsuperpositions of mean-field basis states (Slater determinants, products of\nspin or qubit states). This is a result of the very high energy level density\nof many-body states which can be easily mixed by a residual interaction between\nparticles. We consider the time dynamics of wave functions and increase of\nentropy in such chaotic systems.\n  As an example we present the time evolution in a closed quantum computer. A\ntime scale for the entropy S(t) increase is t_c =t_0/(n log_2{n}), where t_0 is\nthe qubit ``lifetime'', n is the number of qubits, S(0)=0 and S(t_c)=1. At t <<\nt_c the entropy is small: S= n t^2 J^2 log_2(1/t^2 J^2), where J is the\ninter-qubit interaction strength. At t > t_c the number of ``wrong'' states\nincreases exponentially as 2^{S(t)} . Therefore, t_c may be interpreted as a\nmaximal time for operation of a quantum computer, since at t > t_c one has to\nstruggle against the second law of thermodynamics. At t >>t_c the system\nentropy approaches that for chaotic eigenstates. \n\n"}
