These serve as one of the signatures\nof quantum coherent evolution in mesoscopic systems. It was shown recently [N.\nGronbech-Jensen and M. Cirillo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 067001 (2005)] that in\nphase qubits (current-biased Josephson junctions) this effect can be mimicked\nby classical oscillations arising due to the anharmonicity of the effective\npotential. Nevertheless, we find qualitative differences between the classical\nand quantum effect. First, while the quantum Rabi oscillations can be produced\nby the subharmonics of the resonant frequency (multiphoton processes), the\nclassical effect also exists when the system is excited at the overtones.\nSecond, the shape of the resonance is, in the classical case,\ncharacteristically asymmetric; while quantum resonances are described by\nsymmetric Lorentzians. Third, the anharmonicity of the potential results in the\nnegative shift of the resonant frequency in the classical case, in contrast to\nthe positive Bloch-Siegert shift in the quantum case.

Two such systems have been proposed: (a) s-wave\nsuperconductor pair potential is proximity induced on a semiconductor, and (b)\npair potential naturally arises from an intrinsic s-wave pairing interaction.\nAs is now well known, such systems in the form of a 2D film or 1D nano-wires in\na wire-network can be used for topological quantum computation. When the\nexternal Zeeman splitting $\\Gamma$ crosses a critical value $\\Gamma_c$, the\nsystem passes from a regular superconducting phase to a non-Abelian topological\nsuperconducting phase. In both cases (a) and (b) we consider in this paper the\npair potential $\\Delta$ is strictly s-wave in both the ordinary and the\ntopological superconducting phases, which are separated by a topological\nquantum critical point at $\\Gamma_c = \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + \\mu^2}$, where $\\mu (>>\n\\Delta)$ is the chemical potential. On the other hand, since $\\Gamma_c >>\n\\Delta$, the Zeeman splitting required for the topological phase ($\\Gamma >\n\\Gamma_c$) far exceeds the value ($\\Gamma \\sim \\Delta$) above which an s-wave\npair potential is expected to vanish (and the system to become\nnon-superconducting) in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We are thus led to\na situation that the topological superconducting phase appears to set in a\nparameter regime at which the system actually is non-superconducting in the\nabsence of spin-orbit coupling. In this paper we address the question of how a\npure s-wave pair potential can survive a strong Zeeman field to give rise to a\ntopological superconducting phase. We show that the spin-orbit coupling is the\ncrucial parameter for the quantum transition into and the robustness of the\ntopologically non-trivial superconducting phase realized for $\\Gamma >>\n\\Delta$. \n\n"}

The main parameter of the surface, which determines\nthe appropriate physics is the coefficient of the interband scattering\n$R_{12}$. For small $R_{12}$ the superconducting order parameter is only\nsuppressed to some extent near the surface for the both bands. For intermediate\nand strong interband scattering there are two possible non-trivial surface\nstates of the order parameter: (i) purely real solution, where the symmetry of\nthe superconducting state near the surface is changed from $s_{\\pm}$ to\nconventional $s_{++}$ and (ii) time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRB) state.

We find that in the presence of SOC the spectrum of\nYu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states is qualitatively different in s-wave and p-wave\nsuperconductor, a fact that can be used to identify the superconducting pairing\nsymmetry of the host system.

We study the effects impurities on\nthis charge ordered phase via a single-band model in which bond order is the\nanalogue of charge order in the cuprates. Impurities are assumed to be\npointlike and are treated within the self-consistent t-matrix approximation\n(SCTMA). We show that suppression of bond order by impurities occurs through\nthe local disruption of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ form factor near individual\nimpurities. Unlike $d$-wave superconductors, where the sensitivity of $T_c$ to\nimpurities can be traced to a vanishing average of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ order\nparameter over the Fermi surface, the response of bond order to impurities is\ndictated by a few Fermi surface \"hotspots\". The bond order transition\ntemperature $T_\\mathrm{bo}$ thus follows a different universal dependence on\nimpurity concentration $n_i$ than does the superconducting $T_c$. In\nparticular, $T_\\mathrm{bo}$ decreases more rapidly than $T_c$ with increasing\n$n_i$ when there is a nonzero Fermi surface curvature at the hotspots.

We define the operators responsible for the SU(2)\nrotations and we derive the non-linear $\\sigma$-model associated with it. In\nthis framework, we demonstrate that SU(2) fluctuations are massless in finite\nportions of the Brillouin Zone corresponding to the anti-nodal regions\n($0,$$\\pi$), ($\\pi,0$). We argue that the presence of SU(2) fluctuations in the\nanti-nodal region leads to the opening of Fermi arcs around the Fermi surface\nand to the formation of the pseudo-gap.

As the impurity strength increases, we find\nthat superconductivity is suppressed for almost all order parameters since (i)\nat zero applied bias, the effective transferred charge calculated from the\nnoise-current ratio tends to the electron charge $e$ and (ii) for finite bias,\nthe current-voltage characteristics follows that of a normal state junction.\nThere are notable exceptions to this trend. First, gapful nontrivial (chiral)\nsuperconductors are very robust against impurity scattering due to the linear\ndispersion relation of their surface Andreev bound states. Second, for nodal\nnontrivial superconductors, only p_x-wave pairing is almost immune to the\npresence of impurities due to the emergence of odd-frequency s-wave Cooper\npairs near the interface. Owing to their anisotropic dependence on the wave\nvector, impurity scattering is an effective pair breaking mechanism for the\nrest of nodal superconductors.

A finite-field counterpart of an Onsager vortex-loop\ntransition in extreme type-II superconductors renders the vortex liquid phase-\nincoherent when the Abrikosov vortex lattice undergoes a first order melting\ntransition. For the filling fractions considered in this paper $f$ given by\n$1/f=12,14,16,20,25,32,48,64,72,84,96,112$, and 128, the vortex liquid phase is\nnot describable as a liquid of well-defined field induced vortex lines.
