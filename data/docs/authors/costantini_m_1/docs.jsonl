Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

In scenarios with very shallow\nelectron density profiles, these transformations have been shown to couple with\nordinary matter effects, jointly producing spectral distortions both in normal\nand inverted hierarchy. In this work we consider a complementary scenario,\ncharacterized by higher electron density, as indicated by post-bounce\nshock-wave simulations. In this case, early collective flavor transitions are\ndecoupled from later, ordinary matter effects. Moreover, such transitions\nbecome more amenable to both numerical computations and analytical\ninterpretations in inverted hierarchy, while they basically vanish in normal\nhierarchy. We numerically evolve the neutrino density matrix in the region\nrelevant for self-interaction effects. In the approximation of averaged\nintersection angle between neutrino trajectories, our simulations neatly show\nthe collective phenomena of synchronization, bipolar oscillations, and spectral\nsplit, recently discussed in the literature.

Similar to previous\nfindings for an 11.2 Msun star, but significantly later, the onset of the\nexplosion is fostered by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI).

This result\nnot only supports the earlier finding that the azimuthal and polar widths of\nthese subbeams narrow with distance (as R^(-3) and R^(-1), respectively), but\nalso implies that the boundary contribution to the solution of the wave\nequation governing the radiation field does not always vanish in the limit\nwhere the boundary tends to infinity. There is a fundamental difference between\nthe classical expressions for the retarded potential and field: while the\nboundary contribution for the potential can always be made zero via a gauge\ntransformation preserving the Lorenz condition, that for the field may be\nneglected only if it diminishes with distance faster than the contribution of\nthe source density in the far zone. In the case of a rotating superluminal\nsource, however, the boundary term in the retarded solution for the field is by\na factor of order R^(1/2) larger than the source term of this solution in the\nlimit, which explains why an argument based on the solution of the wave\nequation governing the field that neglects the boundary term (such as that\npresented by J.

However, both methods are affected by\nvarious selection and modelling biases, whch we aim to investigate in a\nconsistent way.

These galaxy\nmodels have separate stellar and dark matter components, each with a range of\ndensity profiles and shapes representative of early-type, central galaxies\nwithout significant contributions from other nearby galaxies. We use Fourier\nmethods to calculate the lensing properties of galaxies with arbitrary surface\ndensity distributions, and Monte Carlo methods to compute lensing statistics\nsuch as point-source lensing cross-sections.

Although\nthe dead zones are stable, there is some transport due to the Reynolds stress\nassociated with waves emitted from the turbulent layers. We model the transport\nin each of the different regions by its own $\\alpha$ parameter, this being 10\nto $10^{3}$ times smaller in dead zones than in active layers. In\ngravitationally unstable regions, $\\alpha$ is determined by the fact that the\ndisk self-adjusts to a state of marginal stability. We construct steady-state\nmodels of such disks. We find that for uniform mass flow, the disk has to be\nmore massive, hotter and thicker at the radii where there is a dead zone. In\ndisks in which the dead zone is very massive, gravitational instabilities are\npresent. Whether such models are realistic or not depends on whether\nhydrodynamical fluctuations driven by the turbulent layers can penetrate all\nthe way inside the dead zone. This may be more easily achieved when the ratio\nof the mass of the active layer to that of the dead zone is relatively large,\nwhich in our models corresponds to $\\alpha$ in the dead zone being about 10% of\n$\\alpha$ in the active layers. If the disk is at some stage of its evolution\nnot in steady-state, then the surface density will evolve toward the\nsteady-state solution. However, if $\\alpha$ in the dead zone is much smaller\nthan in the active zone, the timescale for the parts of the disk beyond a few\nAU to reach steady-state may become longer than the disk lifetime. Steady-state\ndisks with dead zones are a more favorable environment for planet formation\nthan standard disks, since the dead zone is typically 10 times more massive\nthan a corresponding turbulent zone at the same location. \n\n"}

As first noted\nby Kardashev in 1986, this baseline can be used to carry out astrometric\nmeasurements of quasar parallaxes, so that only microarcsecond precision is\nnecessary to detect parallax shifts of objects at gigaparsec distances. Such\nprecision will soon be approached with the launch of the astrometric satellites\nGaia and SIM. We use a Fisher matrix formalism to investigate the constraints\nthat these and future missions may be able to place on the cosmological\ndistance scale and dark energy. We find that by observing around a million\nquasars as planned, an extended 10 year Gaia mission could detect quasar\nparallax shifts at the 2.8 sigma level and so measure the Hubble constant to\nwithin 25 km/s. For the interferometer SIMLite, a Key Project using 2.4 % of\nthe total mission time to observe 750 quasars could detect the effect at the 2\nsigma level. Gaia and a dedicated SIMLite only weakly constrain the presence of\na cosmological constant at the ~1 sigma levels.

However, problems with this interpretation are that: (1)\nSome lenticulars, such as NGC 3115, are isolated field galaxies rather than\ncluster members. (2) The distribution of flattening values of S0 galaxies in\nclusters, in groups and in the field are statistically indistinguishable. This\nis surprising because one might have expected most of the progenitors of field\nS0 galaxies to have been flattened late-type galaxies, whereas lenticulars in\nclusters are thought to have mostly been derived from bulge-dominated\nearly-type galaxies. (3) It should be hardest for ram-pressure to strip massive\nluminous galaxies with deep potential wells. However, no statistically\nsignificant differences are seen between the luminosity distributions of\nearly-type Shapley-Ames galaxies in clusters, groups and in the field.

Most observed dwarf\ngalaxies consists of a rotating stellar disc embedded in a massive DM halo with\na near constant-density core. Yet, models based on the CDM scenario invariably\nform galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar \"bulges\" and steep central DM\nprofiles, as low angular momentum baryons and DM sink to the center of galaxies\nthrough accretion and repeated mergers.

This failure is potentially\ncatastrophic for the CDM model, possibly requiring a different DM particle\ncandidate. This Letter presents new hydrodynamical simulations in a Lambda$CDM\nframework where analogues of dwarf galaxies, bulgeless and with a shallow\ncentral DM profile, are formed. This is achieved by resolving the inhomogeneous\ninterstellar medium, resulting in strong outflows from supernovae explosions\nwhich remove low angular momentum gas.

The\ntechnical reason for this effect to occur is the property of Bogolubov's\ncoefficients which mix the positive and negative frequencies modes. The\ncorresponding mixture can not be avoided because the projections to positive\n-frequency modes with respect to Minkowski time t and positive -frequency modes\nwith respect to the Rindler observer's proper time \\eta are not equivalent. The\nexact cancellation of unphysical degrees of freedom which is maintained in\nMinkowski space can not hold in the Rindler space.

We simulate planet\nobservations with a Planck-like scanning strategy, telescope beams, noise, and\ndetector properties. Then we employ both parametric and non-parametric\ntechniques, reconstructing beams directly from the time-ordered data. With a\nfaithful parameterization of the beam shape, we can constrain certain detector\nproperties, such as the time constants of the detectors, to high precision.\nAlternatively, we decompose the beam using an orthogonal basis. For both\ntechniques, we characterize the errors in the beam reconstruction with Monte\nCarlo realizations.

Finally, we explore the consequences for\nmeasuring cosmological parameters, focusing on the spectral index of primordial\nscalar perturbations, n_s. The quality of the power spectrum measurement will\nbe significantly influenced by the optical modeling of the telescope.

Dust properties for carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars Abstract: We present a 2Dust model for the dust shell around a LMC long-period variable\n(LPV) previously studied as part of the OGLE survey. OGLE LMC LPV 28579 (SAGE\nJ051306.40-690946.3) is a carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star for\nwhich we have photometry and spectra from the Spitzer SAGE and SAGE-Spec\nprograms along with UBVIJHK_s photometry. By modeling this source, we obtain a\nbaseline set of dust properties to be used in the construction of a grid of\nmodels for carbon stars. We reproduce its spectral energy distribution using a\nmixture of AmC and SiC (15% by mass). The grain sizes are distributed according\nto the KMH model. The best-fit model has an optical depth of 0.28 for the shell\nat the peak of the SiC feature, with R_in~1430 R_sun or 4.4 R_star. The\ntemperature at this inner radius is 1310 K.

After\nsubtraction of a model of the smooth cluster emission, we find a number of\napproximately radial surface brightness depressions which are not present in\nsimulated images and are seen in both the Chandra and XMM-Newton data. The\ndepressions are most strongly seen in the south of the cluster and have a\nmagnitude of around 4 per cent in surface brightness. We see these features in\nboth an energy band sensitive to the density (0.6 to 5 keV) and a band more\nsensitive to the pressure (3.5 to 7.5 keV). Histograms of surface brightness in\nthe data, when compared to realisations of a smooth model, reveal stronger\nsurface brightness variations. We use the Delta-variance technique to\ncharacterise the magnitude of the fluctuations as a function of length scale.\nWe find that the spectrum in the 0.6 to 5 keV band is flatter than expected for\nKolmogorov index fluctuations. If characterised by a power spectrum, on large\nscales it would have an index around -1.7, rather than -3.7. The implied 3D\ndensity fluctuations have a standard deviation of around 4 per cent. The\nimplied 3D pressure variations are at most 4 per cent. Most of the longer-scale\npower in the density spectrum is contributed by the southern half of the\ncluster, where the depressions are seen. The density variations implied by the\nspectrum of the northern sector have a standard deviation of about 2 per cent. \n\n"}

In technical terms, this spin chain is built out\nof the alternating product of the gl(1|1) fundamental representation and its\ndual. The local energy densities - the nearest neighbor Heisenberg-like\ncouplings - provide a representation of the Jones Temperley Lieb (JTL) algebra.\nThe symmetry algebra is then the centralizer of JTL, and turns out to be\nsmaller than for the open chain, since it is now only a subalgebra of U_q sl(2)\nat q=i, dubbed U_q^{odd} sl(2). A crucial step in our associative algebraic\napproach to bulk logarithmic conformal field theory (LCFT) is then the analysis\nof the spin chain as a bimodule over U_q^{odd} sl(2) and JTL.

Intrinsic physical properties of\nsmall bodies are sought by searching for relationships between the dynamical\nand taxonomic classes, size, and density. Mass and volume estimates for 287\nsmall bodies are collected from the literature. The accuracy and biases\naffecting the methods used to estimate these quantities are discussed and\nbest-estimates are strictly selected. Bulk densities are subsequently computed\nand compared with meteorite density, allowing to estimate the macroporosity\nwithin these bodies. Dwarf-planets apparently have no macroporosity, while\nsmaller bodies can have large voids. This trend is apparently correlated with\nsize: C and S-complex asteroids tends to have larger density with increasing\ndiameter. The average density of each Bus-DeMeo taxonomic classes is computed.\nS-complex asteroids are more dense on average than those in the C-complex that\nin turn have a larger macroporosity, although both complexes partly overlap.\nWithin the C-complex, B-types stand out in albedo, reflectance spectra, and\ndensity, indicating a unique composition.

The radio emission is found to have\na complex modulation dominated by a periodicity of ~20 times its rotational\nperiod P (0.197s), whose phase and strength depends on pulse longitude. This\nperiodicity exhibits a phase-locked delay of about 2.5P between the main pulse\n(MP) and interpulse (IP), presumed to be the opposite poles of the pulsar. This\ndelay corresponds to a light travel distance of many times the light cylinder\nradius. More complex modulations are found within the MP on timescales down to\nabout 9P, and both these and the principal modulation vary strongly across the\n(at least) 7 components which the MP and IP exhibit.

In this paper, we\npresent a global scenario based on calculations coupling episodic accretion\nhistories derived from numerical simulations of collapsing cloud prestellar\ncores of various masses and subsequent protostar evolution. Our calculations\nshow that, assuming an initial protostar mass $\\mi \\sim 1\\,\\mjup$, typical of\nthe second Larson's core, both the luminosity spread in the HRD and the\ninferred properties of Fu Ori events (mass, radius, accretion rate) can be\nexplained by this scenario, providing two conditions. First, there must be some\nvariation within the fraction of accretion energy absorbed by the protostar\nduring the accretion process. Second the range of this variation should\nincrease with increasing accretion burst intensity, and thus with the initial\ncore mass and final star mass.

We present how the planetary\nmass-radius relationship of planets with primordial H/He envelopes forms and\nevolves in time. The basic shape of the M-R relation can be understood from the\ncore accretion model. Low-mass planets cannot bind massive envelopes, while\nsuper-critical cores necessarily trigger runway gas accretion, leading to\n\"forbidden\" zones in the M-R plane. For a given mass, there is a considerable\ndiversity of radii. We compare the synthetic M-R relation with the observed\none, finding good agreement for a>0.1 AU. The synthetic radius distribution is\ncharacterized by a strong increase towards small R, and a second, lower local\nmaximum at ~1 Jovian radius. The increase towards small radii reflects the\nincrease of the mass function towards low M. The second local maximum is due to\nthe fact that radii are nearly independent of mass for giant planets. A\ncomparison of the synthetic radius distribution with Kepler data shows\nagreement for R>2 Earth radii, but divergence for smaller radii. We predict\nthat in the next few years, Kepler should find the second, local maximum at ~1\nJovian radius. \n\n"}

The FUV is dominantly radiated from\nnewly formed short-lived OB stars, while the FIR is emitted by dust grains\nheated by the FUV radiation field. It is known that dust is always associated\nwith star formation activity. Thus, both FUV and FIR are tightly related to the\nstar formation in galaxies, but in a very complicated manner. In order to\ndisentangle the relation between FUV and FIR emissions, we estimate the UV-IR\nbivariate LF (BLF) of galaxies with {\\sl GALEX} and {\\sl AKARI} All-Sky Survey\ndatasets. Recently we invented a new mathematical method to construct the BLF\nwith given marginals and prescribed correlation coefficient. This method makes\nuse of a tool from mathematical statistics, so called \"copula\". The copula\nenables us to construct a bivariate distribution function from given marginal\ndistributions with prescribed correlation and/or dependence structure. With\nthis new formulation and FUV and FIR univariate LFs, we analyze various FUV and\nFIR data with {\\sl GALEX}, {\\sl Spitzer}, and {\\sl AKARI} to estimate the UV-IR\nBLF. The obtained BLFs naturally explain the nonlinear complicated relation\nbetween FUV and FIR emission from star-forming galaxies.

MBHBs are expected to be the main\ngravitational wave (GW) sources for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs); however, it is\nstill unclear if the observed GW signal will be produced by a few single MBHBs,\nor if it will have the properties of a stochastic background. The goal of this\nwork is to produce a map of the sky in which each galaxy is assigned a\nprobability of having suffered a recent merger, and of hosting a MBHB that\ncould be detected by PTAs. This constitutes a step forward in the understanding\nof the expected PTA signal: the skymap can be used to investigate the\nclustering properties of PTA sources and the spatial distribution of the\nobservable GW signal power; moreover, galaxies with the highest probabilities\ncould be used as inputs in targeted searches for individual GW sources.

On a cosmological scale, matter is usually distributed along\nfilaments, and filaments are also typical features of the interstellar medium.\nWithin a cosmic filament, matter can contract and form galaxies, whereas an\ninterstellar gas filament can clump into a series of bead-like structures which\ncan then turn into stars. To investigate the growth of such instabilities, we\nderive a local dispersion relation for an idealized self-gravitating filament,\nand study some of its properties. Our idealized picture consists of an infinite\nself-gravitating and rotating cylinder with pressure and density related by a\npolytropic equation of state. We assume no specific density distribution, treat\nmatter as a fluid, and use hydrodynamics to derive the linearized equations\nthat govern the local perturbations. We obtain a dispersion relation for\naxisymmetric perturbations and study its properties in the (k_R, k_z) phase\nspace, where k_R and k_z are respectively the radial and longitudinal\nwavenumbers. While the boundary between the stable and unstable regimes is\nsymmetrical in k_R and k_z and analogous to the Jeans criterion, the most\nunstable mode displays an asymmetry that could constrain the shape of the\nstructures that form within the filament. Here the results are applied to a\nfiducial interstellar filament, but could be extended for more astrophysical\nsystems such as cosmological filaments and tidal tails. \n\n"}

We performed SPH simulations using\nisolated galaxy models for the purpose of verifying whether dynamical and\nchemical properties of the thick discs formed in such clumpy galaxies are\ncompatible with observations. The results of our simulations seem nearly\nconsistent with observations in dynamical properties such as radial and\nvertical density profiles, significant rotation velocity lag with height and\ndistributions of orbital eccentricities. In addition, the thick discs in our\nsimulations indicate nearly exponential dependence of azimuthal and vertical\nvelocity dispersions with radius, nearly isothermal kinematics in vertical\ndirection and negligible metallicity gradients in radial and vertical\ndirections. However, our simulations cannot reproduce altitudinal dependence of\neccentricities, metallicity relations with eccentricities or rotation\nvelocities, which shows striking discrepancy from recent observations of the\nGalactic thick disc.

From this division, we\nderive two parameters: $A_{\\rm o}$, which measures the asymmetry of the OHR,\nand $D_{\\rm o}$, which measures the deviation of the intensity weighted\ncentroid of the OHR from that of the IHR relative to the effective radius.

In this paper, we present an\nanalysis of 32 GRB X-ray flares that are simultaneously observed by both BAT\nand XRT on board the Swift mission, so a joint spectral analysis with a wider\nspectral coverage is possible. Our results show that the joint spectra of 19\nflares are fitted with the absorbed single power-law or the Band function\nmodels. More interestingly, the joint spectra of the other 13 X-ray flares are\nfitted with the absorbed single power-law model plus a black body (BB)\ncomponent. Phenomenally, the observed spectra of these 13 flares are analogous\nto several GRBs with a thermal component, but only with a much lower\ntemperature of $kT=1\\sim 3$ keV. Assuming that the thermal emission is the\nphotosphere emission of the GRB fireball, we derive the fireball properties of\nthe 13 flares that have redshift measurements, such as the bulk Lorentz factor\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm ph}$ of the outflow. The derived $\\Gamma_{\\rm ph}$ range from $50$\nto $150$ and a relation of $\\Gamma_{\\rm ph}$ to the thermal emission luminosity\nis found. It is consistent with the $\\Gamma_0-L_{\\rm iso}$ relation that are\nderived for the prompt gamma-ray emission.

In this work, I present a method to produce the disk-integrated\nsignature of planets that are described in their three-dimensional complexity,\ni.e. with both horizontal and vertical variations in the optical properties of\ntheir envelopes. The approach is based on pre-conditioned backward Monte Carlo\nintegration of the vector Radiative Transport Equation and yields the full\nStokes vector for outgoing reflected radiation. The method is demonstrated\nthrough selected examples inspired by published work at wavelengths from the\nvisible to the near infrared and terrestrial prescriptions of both cloud and\nsurface albedo maps. A clear advantage of this approach is that its\ncomputational cost does not appear to be significantly affected by\nnon-uniformities in the planet optical properties.

Mech. Dyn. Astron. vol. 116, 109, 2013) to the study of the rotation of\nstars hosting massive close-in planets. The stars have nearly the same tidal\nrelaxation factors as gaseous planets and the evolution of their rotation is\nsimilar to that of close-in hot Jupiters: they tidally evolve towards a\nstationary solution. However, stellar rotation may also be affected by stellar\nwind braking. Thus, while the rotation of a quiet host star evolves towards a\nstationary attractor with a frequency ($1+6e^2$) times the orbital mean-motion\nof the companion, the continuous loss of angular momentum in an active star\ndisplaces the stationary solution towards slower values: Active host stars with\nbig close-in companions tend to have rotational periods larger than the orbital\nperiods of their companions. The study of some hypothetical examples shows that\nbecause of tidal evolution, the rules of gyrochronology cannot be used to\nestimate the age of one system with a large close-in companion, no matter if\nthe star is quiet or active, if the current semi-major axis of the companion is\nsmaller than 0.03--0.04 AU.

Our aim is to use rotational evolution models to\nconstrain the mass loss rates in stellar winds and to predict how their\nproperties evolve with time on the main-sequence.\n  Methods: We construct a rotational evolution model that is driven by observed\nrotational distributions of young stellar clusters. Fitting the free parameters\nin our model allows us to predict how wind mass loss rate depends on stellar\nmass, radius, and rotation. We couple the results to the wind model developed\nin Paper I of this series to predict how wind properties evolve on the\nmain-sequence.\n  Results: We estimate that wind mass loss rate scales with stellar parameters\nas $\\dot{M}_\\star \\propto R_\\star^2 \\Omega_\\star^{1.33} M_\\star^{-3.36}$. We\nestimate that at young ages, the solar wind likely had a mass loss rate that is\nan order of magnitude higher than that of the current solar wind. This leads to\nthe wind having a higher density at younger ages; however, the magnitude of\nthis change depends strongly on how we scale wind temperature. Due to the\nspread in rotation rates, young stars show a large range of wind properties at\na given age. This spread in wind properties disappears as the stars age.\n  Conclusions: There is a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the evolution\nof stellar winds on the main-sequence, due both to our lack of knowledge of\nstellar winds and the large spread in rotation rates at young ages. Given the\nsensitivity of planetary atmospheres to stellar wind and radiation conditions,\nthese uncertainties can be significant for our understanding of the evolution\nof planetary environments. \n\n"}

Of particular significance are: a) the\ncored dark matter profile of disk galaxies, b) correlations of the shape of\nrotation curves with baryonic properties, and c) Tully-Fisher relations. Dark\nmatter halos around disk galaxies may have nontrivial dynamics if dark matter\nis strongly self interacting and dissipative. Multicomponent hidden sector dark\nmatter featuring a massless `dark photon' (from an unbroken dark $U(1)$ gauge\ninteraction) which kinetically mixes with the ordinary photon provides a\nconcrete example of such dark matter. The kinetic mixing interaction\nfacilitates halo heating by enabling ordinary supernovae to be a source of\nthese `dark photons'. Dark matter halos can expand and contract in response to\nthe heating and cooling processes, but for a sufficiently isolated halo could\nhave evolved to a steady state or `equilibrium' configuration where heating and\ncooling rates locally balance. This dynamics allows the dark matter density\nprofile to be related to the distribution of ordinary supernovae in the disk of\na given galaxy.

The formalism requires us\nto assume models for (1) pulse broadening due to scattering in the ionized\ninter-galactic medium - we consider two different models for this, (2) the\nfrequency spectrum of the emitted pulse - we consider a power law model\n$E_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{-\\alpha}$ with $-5 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 5$, and (3) the\ncomoving number density of the FRB occurrence rate $n(E,w_i,z)$ - we ignore the\nz dependence and assume a fixed intrinsic pulse width $w_i = 1$ms for all the\nFRBs. The distribution of the emitted pulse energy $E$ is modelled through (a)\na delta-function where all the FRBs have the same energy $E = E_0$ , and (b) a\nSchechter luminosity function where the energies have a spread around $E_0$.\nThe models are all normalized using the 4 FRBs detected by Thornton et al.\n(2013).

Initial detections however will be low signal-to-noise,\nlimited by systematics. To confirm a putative 21-cm detection, and check the\naccuracy of 21-cm data analysis pipelines, it would be very useful to\ncross-correlate against a genuine cosmological signal. The most promising\ncosmological signals are wide-field maps of Lyman alpha emitting galaxies\n(LAEs), expected from the Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) Ultra-Deep field. Here\nwe present estimates of the correlation between LAE maps at z~7 and the 21-cm\nsignal observed by both the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the planned Square\nKilometer Array Phase 1 (SKA1). We adopt a systematic approach, varying both:\n(i) the prescription of assigning LAEs to host halos; and (ii) the large-scale\nstructure of neutral and ionized regions (i.e. EoR morphology).

A possible resolution to\nthis conundrum is that many AGN are reddened by dust along the line of sight.\nTo explore this possibility, we stack 5000 SDSS AGN with luminosity\nL~10^45erg/s and redshift z~0.4 in bins of optical continuum slope alpha_opt\nand width of the broad H$\\beta$ emission line. We measure the EW of the NaID\nabsorption feature in each stacked spectrum. We find a linear relation between\nalpha_opt and EW(NaID), such that EW(NaID) increases as alpha_opt becomes\nredder. In the bin with the smallest H$\\beta$ width, objects with the bluest\nslopes that are similar to accretion disk predictions are found to have\nEW(NaID)=0, supporting the line-of-sight dust hypothesis. This conclusion is\nalso supported by the dependence of the $H\\alpha/H\\beta$ line ratio on\nalpha_opt. The implied relationship between alpha_opt and dust reddening is\ngiven by E(B-V)~0.2(-0.1-alpha_opt), and the implied reddening of a typical\ntype 1 AGN with alpha_opt=-0.5 is E(B-V)~0.08mag. Photoionization calculations\nshow that the dusty gas responsible for reddening is too ionized to produce the\nobserved features. Therefore, we argue that the sodium absorption arises in\nregions of the host ISM which are shielded from the AGN radiation, and the\ncorrelation with alpha_opt arises since ISM columns along shielded and\nnon-shielded sightlines are correlated. This scenario is supported by the\nsimilarity of the E(B-V)-NaID relation implied by our results with the relation\nin the Milky-Way found by previous studies. \n\n"}

Compared with previous\nmeasurements in literature that are usually based on direct Fourier Transform\nin redshift space, our method has the advantages that the window function and\nshot-noise are fully corrected. In fact, our 2D power spectrum, by its\nconstruction, can accurately reproduce the 2D correlation function, and in the\nmeanwhile can reproduce, for example, the 2D power spectrum of Beutler et al.\n(2014) accurately if ours is convolved with the window function they provided.\nThus, our measurement can facilitate a direct comparison with the theoretical\npredictions.

The level of this discrepancy significantly exceeds the\nmaximum halo assembly bias signal predicted by LCDM. In this study, we explore\nwhether some of the clustering bias differences could be caused by biases in\n$R_{\\mathrm{mem}}$ due to projection effects from other systems along the\nline-of-sight.

Using the angular mark correlation functions of clusters, we\nshow that the large-scale bias differences when splitting by $R_{\\mathrm{mem}}$\ncan be largely attributed to such projection effects. After splitting by\n$\\tilde{R}_{\\mathrm{mem}}$, the anomalously large signal is reduced, giving a\nratio of $1.02\\pm0.14$ between the two clustering biases as measured from weak\nlensing.

To reach this\nperformance requires an accurate and robust data analysis method, especially\nsince the possible WEP violation signal will be dominated by a strongly colored\nnoise. An important complication is brought by the fact that some values will\nbe missing -therefore, the measured time series will not be strictly regularly\nsampled. Those missing values induce a spectral leakage that significantly\nincreases the noise in Fourier space, where the WEP violation signal is looked\nfor, thereby complicating scientific returns. Recently, we developed an\ninpainting algorithm to correct the MICROSCOPE data for missing values. This\ncode has been integrated in the official MICROSCOPE data processing pipeline\nbecause it enables us to significantly measure an equivalence principle\nviolation (EPV) signal in a model-independent way, in the inertial satellite\nconfiguration. In this work, we present several improvements to the method that\nmay allow us now to reach the MICROSCOPE requirements for both inertial and\nspin satellite configurations. The main improvement has been obtained using a\nprior on the power spectrum of the colored-noise that can be directly derived\nfrom the incomplete data.

They are commonly believed not to have formed in situ,\nrequiring inwards migration towards the host star. One of the proposed\nmigration scenarios is secular high-eccentricity or high-$e$ migration, in\nwhich the orbit of the planet is perturbed to high eccentricity by secular\nprocesses, triggering strong tidal evolution and orbital migration. Previous\ntheoretical studies have considered secular excitation in stellar binaries.\nRecently, a number of HJs have been observed in stellar triple systems. In the\nlatter, the secular dynamics are much richer compared to stellar binaries, and\nHJs could potentially be formed more efficiently. Here, we investigate this\npossibility by modeling the secular dynamical and tidal evolution of planets in\ntwo hierarchical configurations in stellar triple systems. We find that the HJ\nformation efficiency is higher compared to stellar binaries, but only by at\nmost a few tens of per cent. The orbital properties of the HJs formed in the\nsimulations are very similar to HJs formed in stellar binaries, and similarly\nto studies of the latter we find no significant number of warm Jupiters. HJs\nare only formed in our simulations for triples with specific orbital\nconfigurations, and our constraints are approximately consistent with current\nobservations. In future, this allows to rule out high-$e$ migration in stellar\ntriples if a HJ is detected in a triple grossly violating these constraints. \n\n"}

The rest of the power is dissipated in the interactions of the\nPWNe with the interstellar medium (ISM). Some of the PWNe are moving relative\nto the ISM with supersonic speeds producing bow shocks. In this case, the\nultrarelativistic particles accelerated at the termination surface of the\npulsar wind may be reaccelerated in the converging flow system formed by the\noutflow from the wind termination shock and the inflow from the bow shock. An\noutcome of this reacceleration is the creation of particle distributions with\nhard spectra, such as required to explain the observed synchrotron spectra with\nphoton indices Gamma <~ 1.5. The presence of this hard component is specific to\nPWNe with bow shocks (BSPWNe). The accelerated particles may end up containing\na substantial fraction of the shock ram pressure. For typical ISM and pulsar\nparameters, the positrons released by these systems are numerous enough to\ncontribute a substantial fraction of the positrons detected as galactic cosmic\nray particles above few tens and up to several hundred GeV. The escape of\nultrarelativistic particles from a BSPWN and its appearance in the far-UV and\nX-ray bands is determined by the directions of the interstellar magnetic field,\nthe velocity of the astrosphere and the pulsar rotation axis. In this respect\nwe review the observed appearance and multiwavelength spectra of three\ndifferent types of BSPWNe: PSR J0437-4715, the Guitar and Lighthouse nebulae,\nand Vela-like objects. We argue that high resolution imaging of such objects\nprovides unique information on pulsar winds and on the ISM.

Previous\nwork on sub-mm and radio variability hints at a lag between X-ray flares and\ntheir candidate sub-millimeter or radio counterparts, with the long wavelength\ndata lagging the X-ray. However, there is only one published time lag between\nan X-ray flare and a possible radio counterpart. Here we report 9\ncontemporaneous X-ray and radio observations of Sgr A*.

The dominant scenario for bulge\nformation is that of the Milky Way as a nearly pure disk galaxy, with the inner\ndisk having formed a bar and buckled. This can potentially explain virtually\nall bulge stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.0, comprising 95% of the stellar population.\nThe evidence is the incredible success in N-body models of this type in making\nmeaningful predictions, such as the rotation curve and velocity dispersion\nmeasured from radial velocities, and the spatial morphologies of the\npeanut/X-shape and the long bar. The classical bulge scenario remains viable\nfor stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.0 and potentially a minority of the other stars. A\nclassical bulge is expected from Lambda-CDM cosmological simulations, can\naccentuate the properties of an existing bar in a hybrid system, and is most\nconsistent with the bulge abundance trends such as [Mg/Fe], which are elevated\nrelative to both the thin and thick disks. Finally, the clumpy-galaxy scenario\nis considered, as it is the correct description of most Milky Way precursors\ngiven observations of high-redshift galaxies. Simulations predict that these\nstar-forming clumps will sometimes migrate to the centres of galaxies where\nthey may form a bulge, and galaxies often include a bulge clump as well. They\nwill possibly form a bar with properties consistent with those of the Milky\nWay, such as the exponential profile and metallicity gradient. Given the\nrelative successes of these scenarios, the Milky Way bulge is plausibly of\ncomposite origin, with a classical bulge and/or inner halo numerically dominant\nfor stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.0, a buckling thick disk for stars with -1.0 <~\n[Fe/H] <~ -0.50 perhaps descended from the clumpy galaxy phase, and a buckling\nthin disk for stars with [Fe/H] >~ -0.50. \n\n"}

We presented several explicit examples\nof the actions which admit the solutions describing regular black hole\nspace-time with multi-horizons. Thermodynamics of the obtained black hole\nsolutions is studied. The explicit expressions of the temperature, the entropy,\nthe thermodynamical energy and the free energy are obtained. Although the\ntemperature vanishes in the extremal limit where the radii of the two horizons\ncoincide with each other as in the standard multi-horizon black hole like the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\" om black hole or the Kerr black hole, the larger temperature\ncorresponds to the larger horizon radius. This is different from the standard\nblack holes, where the larger temperature corresponds to the smaller horizon\nradius. We also found that the specific heat becomes positive for the large\ntemperature, which is also different from the standard black holes, where the\nspecific heat is negative. It should be also noted that the thermodynamical\nenergy is not identical with the ADM mass.

Here we point out that this can not only be\nused to provide a method to determine the standard relation between halo mass\nand concentration, but also to use large samples of objects in order to place\nconstraints on dark matter self-interactions that can be more robust than\nconstraints derived from individual objects. We demonstrate our method by\nconsidering a sample of about 50 objects distributed across the whole halo mass\nrange, and by modelling the effect of self-interactions in a way similar to\nwhat has been previously done in the literature. Using additional input from\nsimulations then results in a constraint on the self-interaction cross section\nper unit dark matter mass of about $\\sigma/m_\\chi\\lesssim 0.3$ cm$^2$/g. We\nexpect that these constraints can be significantly improved in the future, and\nmade more robust, by i) an improved modelling of the effect of\nself-interactions, both theoretical and by comparison with simulations, ii)\ntaking into account a larger sample of objects and iii) by reducing the\ncurrently still relatively large uncertainties that we conservatively assign to\nthe surface densities of individual objects.

For the\n2-sphere, spin-weighted harmonics allow for automating calculations in a\nfashion as similar to Fourier series as possible. Derivative operators act as\nwavenumber multiplication on a set of spectral coefficients.

This softening leads to more compact equilibrium\nconfigurations of neutron stars compared to pure hadronic stars of the same\nmass. We investigate the question to which amount the compactness of a neutron\nstar can be attributed to the presence of a quark phase. For this purpose we\nemploy several hadronic EOS in the framework of the relativistic mean-field\n(RMF) model and an extended MIT bag model to describe the quark phase. We find\nthat - almost independent of the model parameters - the radius of a pure\nhadronic neutron star gets typically reduced by 20-30% if a pure quark phase in\nthe center of the star does exist. For some EOS we furthermore find the\npossibility of a \"third family\" of compact stars which may exist besides the\ntwo known families of white dwarfs and neutron stars.

The cooler component of the 2T model has a temperature (T_c\n\\~ 0.7 keV) similar to the kinetic temperature of the stars. The hot phase has\na temperature (T_h ~ 1.4 keV) characteristic of the virial temperature of the\n\\~10^{13} M_{sun} halo expected in the NGC 5044 group. However, in view of the\nmorphological disturbances and X-ray holes visible in the Chandra image within\nR ~10 kpc, bubbles of gas heated to ~T_h in this region may be formed by\nintermittent AGN feedback. Some additional heating at larger radii may be\nassociated with the evolution of the cold front near R ~50 kpc, as suggested by\nthe sharp edge in the EPIC images. \n\n"}

We identify 12 cosmological systems, and 6 systems\nthat are either ejected from the background QSO or affected by its local\nradiation field. Almost all of the intergalactic OVI is associated with strong\nLy-a absorption (N_HI > 10^15.2 cm^-2), as well as absorption from CIV and\noften lower ionization species. The absorbing regions are conservatively\nconstrained to have L<=200 kpc and rho/rho_bar >= 2.5, with actual values\nprobably closer to L ~ 60 kpc and rho/rho_bar ~ 10-30. They also have two\ndistinct gas phases: one which produces photoionized CIV and SiIV at T ~ 30,000\nK, and a second which is seen only in OVI. The OVI temperature is difficult to\nconstrain due to uncertainty in the amount of nonthermal line broadening, but\nit does appear that this gas is hotter than the CIV/SiIV phase and could\nsupport collisional OVI production. The OVI is strongly clustered on velocity\nscales of dv=100-300 km/s, with weaker signal extending to dv = 750 km/s. The\npower-law slope of the correlation function resembles that of local galaxy and\ncluster surveys, with a comoving correlation length of 11h_{65}^-1 Mpc. The\naverage Oxygen abundance of the OVI systems is [O/H]>-1.5, about 10 times\nhigher than the level observed in the general IGM. Two OVI production\nmechanisms are considered: shock heating of gas falling onto existing\nstructure, and expulsion of material by galactic winds.

Rotationally induced mixing\nduring the thermal pulses produces a layer (~2E-5M_sun) on top of the CO-core\nwhere large amounts of protons and C12 co-exist. We follow the abundance\nevolution in this layer, in particular that of the neutron source C13 and of\nthe neutron poison N14. In our AGB model mixing persists during the entire\ninterpulse phase due to the steep angular velocity gradient at the\ncore-envelope interface. We follow the neutron production during the interpulse\nphase, and find a resulting maximum neutron exposure of tau_max =0.04 mbarn^-1,\nwhich is too small to produce any significant s-process. In parametric models,\nwe then investigate the combined effects of diffusive overshooting from the\nconvective envelope and rotationally induced mixing. Models with overshoot and\nweaker interpulse mixing - as perhaps expected from more slowly rotating stars\n- yield larger neutron exposures. We conclude that the incorporation of\nrotationally induce mixing processes has important consequences for the\nproduction of heavy elements in AGB stars.

The intrinsic alignments are believed to\nbe small for deep surveys, but this is based on intrinsic and lensing\ndistortions being uncorrelated. Here we show that the gravitational lensing\nshear and intrinsic shear need not be independent: correlations between the\ntidal field and the intrinsic shear cause the intrinsic shear of nearby\ngalaxies to be correlated with the gravitational shear acting on more distant\ngalaxies. We estimate the magnitude of this effect for two simple intrinsic\nalignment models: one in which the galaxy ellipticity is linearly related to\nthe tidal field, and one in which it is quadratic in the tidal field as\nsuggested by tidal torque theory. The first model predicts a\ngravitational-intrinsic (GI) correlation that can be much greater than the\nintrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation for broad redshift distributions, and that\nremains when galaxies pairs at similar redshifts are rejected.

Abstract: There is mounting evidence that long duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are\nproduced by ultra-relativistic jets of ordinary matter which are ejected in\ncore collapse supernova (SN) explosions. Such jets are extremely efficient\ncosmic ray (CR) accelerators which can accelerate the swept up ambient\nparticles on their way to the highest observed CR energies. The bulk of the jet\nkinetic energy is used to accelerate CRs while only a tiny fraction is used to\nproduce the GRB and its afterglow. Here we use the remarkably successful\ncannonball (CB) model of GRBs to show that the bipolar jets from SN explosions,\nwhich produce GRBs most of which are not beamed towards Earth, can be the main\norigin of cosmic rays at all energies. The model explains very simply the\nelemental composition of CRs and their observed spectra at all energies. In\nparticular it explains the origin of the CR knees and ankle. Above the CR\nankle, the Galactic magnetic fields can no longer delay the free escape of\nultra-high energies CRs (UHECR) from the Galaxy, and the CRs from the\nintergalactic medium (IGM), which were injected there by SN jets from all the\ngalaxies and isotropized there by the IGM magnetic fields, dominate the\nGalactic CR spectrum. A Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) effect due to the\ninteraction of UHECRs with the microwave background radiation is expected. The\nCR nuclei which diffuse out of galaxies, or are directly deposited in the IGM\nby the relativistic SN jets, may be the origin of the IGM magnetic fields.\nInverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background radiation (MBR)\nby the CR electrons in the IGM produces the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray\nbackground radiation (GBR). \n\n"}

Stellar light contributes relatively more to the\nMIR emission of YSOs with lower temperature stars (Tstar ~4000 K) because the\nemission peak wavelength of the star is closer to that of the thermal\nradiation. Next we consider realistic Class 0, I, and II source models and find\nthat the other dominant effect of varying stellar temperature on YSO SEDs is\nthat of the inner disk wall: In high-Tstar models, the dust destruction radius\nis much further out with a consequently larger inner disk wall that contributes\nrelatively more to the 2-10 um flux.

The\nearly X-ray afterglows show a canonical behavior, where the light curve broadly\nconsists of three distinct power law segments: (i) an initial very steep decay\n(t^{-alpha} with 3<alpha_1<5), followed by (ii) a very shallow decay\n(0.2<alpha_2<0.8), and finally (iii) a somewhat steeper decay (1<alpha_3<1.5).\nThese power law segments are separated by two corresponding break times,\n300s<t_{break,1}<500s and 10^3s<t_{break,2}<10^4s. On top of this canonical\nbehavior of the early X-ray light curve, many events have superimposed X-ray\nflares, which are most likely caused by internal shocks due to long lasting\nsporadic activity of the central engine, up to several hours after the GRB. We\nfind that the initial steep decay is consistent with it being the tail of the\nprompt emission, from photons that are radiated at large angles relative to our\nline of sight. The first break in the light curve (t_{break,1}) takes place\nwhen the forward shock emission becomes dominant, with the intermediate shallow\nflux decay (alpha_2) likely caused by the continuous energy injection into the\nexternal shock. When this energy injection stops, a second break is then\nobserved in the light curve (t_{break,2}). This energy injection increases the\nenergy of the afterglow shock by at least a factor of f>4, and augments the\nalready severe requirements for the efficiency of the prompt gamma-ray\nemission. \n\n"}

Mass transfer\nfrom such low mass white dwarfs very probably starts during the hydrogen\nburning stage, and the donor structure will remain dominated by the burning\nshell until it loses all the hydrogen envelope and begins transferring helium.\nWe model mass transfer from these low mass white dwarfs, and show that the\nradius of the donor decreases while they shed the hydrogen envelope. This\nradius behavior, which is due to the fact that the white dwarf is not fully\ndegenerate, has two important consequences on the evolution of the binary: 1)\nthe orbital period decreases, with a timescale consistent with the period\ndecrease of the binary RXJ0806.3+1527; 2) the mass transfer rate is a factor of\nabout 10 smaller than from a fully degenerate white dwarf, easing the problem\nconnected with the small X-ray luminosity of this object.

In this\npaper, we compute constraints on inflationary parameters within a more general\nframework that includes other physically motivated parameters such as a nonzero\nneutrino mass. We find that a strong degeneracy between the tensor-to-scalar\nratio r and the neutrino mass prevents lambda phi^4 from being excluded by\npresent data. Reversing the argument, if lambda phi^4 is the correct model of\ninflation, it predicts a sum of neutrino masses at 0.3-0.5 eV, a range\ncompatible with present experimental limits and within the reach of the next\ngeneration of neutrino mass measurements.

We find that higher excess absorption column densities\nwith $\\Delta N_{\\rm H} > 2\\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ are only present in bursts\nwith redshifts z$<$2.

It is\npossible to separate first overtone from fundamental mode population I Cepheids\ntaking into account the pulsation amplitude, the shape of the light curve and\nthe period. The expected separation is verified in the period--luminosity $PL$\ndiagram. Light curve Fourier parameters have been compared with those of\nMagellanic Clouds and galactic Cepheids, in order to point out the effects of\nthe very low metallicity of IC 1613 on the light curve shape. Population II\nCepheids of IC 1613 can be discriminated from those of population I in the $PL$\ndiagram, and, taking into account their color, from other red or blue\nvariables. Their $PL$ relation is consistent with that observed in globular\nclusters, nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies and LMC. We have shown it is\npossible to apply the single-phase method for deriving standard photometry $PL$\nrelations for population I and II Cepheids; therefore with just one accurate\n$BVRI$ observation it is possible to use the population I Cepheids for distance\ndeterminations.

Abstract: We consider the possibility that the total dark energy (DE) of the Universe\nis made out of two dynamical components of different nature: a variable\ncosmological term, Lambda, and a dynamical ``cosmon'', X, possibly interacting\nwith Lambda but not with matter -- which remains conserved. We call this\nscenario the LXCDM model. One possibility for X would be a scalar field, but it\nis not the only one. The overall equation of state (EOS) of the LXCDM model can\neffectively appear as quintessence or phantom energy depending on the mixture\nof the two components. Both the dynamics of Lambda and of X could be linked to\nhigh energy effects near the Planck scale. In the case of Lambda it may be\nrelated to the running of this parameter under quantum effects, whereas X might\nbe identified with some fundamental field (say, a dilaton) left over as a\nlow-energy ``relic'' by e.g. string theory. We find that the dynamics of the\nLXCDM model can trigger a future stopping of the Universe expansion and can\nkeep the ratio rho_D/rho_m (DE density to matter-radiation density) bounded and\nof order 1. Therefore, the model could explain the so-called ``cosmological\ncoincidence problem''. This is in part related to the possibility that the\npresent value of the cosmological term can be Lambda<0 in this framework (the\ncurrent total DE density nevertheless being positive). However, a cosmic halt\ncould occur even if Lambda>0 because of the peculiar behavior of X as ``Phantom\nMatter''. We describe various cosmological scenarios made possible by the\ncomposite and dynamical nature of LXCDM, and discuss in detail their impact on\nthe cosmological coincidence problem. \n\n"}

Although most of our discussion refers to arbitrary p-branes, when\nwe need to be specific we assume that they are D-branes of Type II or Type I\nstring theory.

The proton fraction is determined by the nuclear symmetry\nenergy whose density dependence may be constrained by measuring the neutron\nradius of a heavy nucleus, such as 208Pb. Such a measurement is necessary for a\nreliable extrapolation of the proton fraction to the higher densities present\nin the neutron star. A large neutron radius in 208Pb implies a stiff symmetry\nenergy that grows rapidly with density, thereby favoring a high proton fraction\nand allowing direct URCA cooling. Predictions for the neutron radius in 208Pb\nare correlated to the proton fraction in dense matter by using a variety of\nrelativistic effective field-theory models. Models that predict a neutron (Rn)\nminus proton (Rp) root-mean-square radius in 208Pb to be Rn-Rp<0.20 fm have\nproton fractions too small to allow the direct URCA cooling of 1.4 solar-mass\nneutron stars.
