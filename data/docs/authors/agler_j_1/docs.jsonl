We are interested\nhere in the case where the curvature is merely semipositive in the sense of\ncurrents, and the base manifold is not necessarily projective. In this\nsituation, one can still obtain interesting information on cohomology, e.g. a\nHard Lefschetz theorem with pseudoeffective coefficients, in the form of a\nsurjectivity statement for the Lefschetz map.

We introduce a notion of cuspidality for\nenhanced Langlands parameters for H, which conjecturally puts supercuspidal\nH-representations in bijection with such L-parameters. We also define a\ncuspidal support map and Bernstein components for enhanced L-parameters, in\nanalogy with Bernstein's theory of representations of p-adic groups. We check\nthat for several well-known reductive groups these analogies are actually\nprecise.\n  Furthermore we reveal a new structure in the space of enhanced L-parameters\nfor H, that of a disjoint union of twisted extended quotients. This is an\nanalogue of the ABPS conjecture (about irreducible H-representations) on the\nGalois side of the local Langlands correspondence. Only, on the Galois side it\nis no longer conjectural. These results will be useful to reduce the problem of\nfinding a local Langlands correspondence for H-representations to the\ncorresponding problem for supercuspidal representations of Levi subgroups of H.\n  The main machinery behind this comes from perverse sheaves on algebraic\ngroups. We extend Lusztig's generalized Springer correspondence to disconnected\ncomplex reductive groups G. It provides a bijection between, on the one hand,\npairs consisting of a unipotent element u in G and an irreducible\nrepresentation of the component group of the centralizer of u in G, and, on the\nother hand, irreducible representations of a set of twisted group algebras of\ncertain finite groups.

{"id": "1607.07979", "contents": "Title: Local polar varieties in the geometric study of singularities Abstract: This text presents several aspects of the theory of equisingularity of\ncomplex analytic spaces from the standpoint of Whitney conditions. The goal is\nto describe from the geometrical, topological, and algebraic viewpoints a\ncanonical locally finite partition of a reduced complex analytic space $X$ into\nnonsingular strata with the property that the local geometry of $X$ is constant\non each stratum. Local polar varieties appear in the title because they play a\ncentral role in the unification of viewpoints. The geometrical viewpoint leads\nto the study of spaces of limit directions at a given point of $X\\subset \\C^n$\nof hyperplanes of $\\C^n$ tangent to $X$ at nonsingular points, which in turn\nleads to the realization that the Whitney conditions, which are used to define\nthe stratification, are in fact of a Lagrangian nature. The local polar\nvarieties are used to analyze the structure of the set of limit directions of\ntangent hyperplanes. This structure helps in particular to understand how a\nsingularity differs from its tangent cone, assumed to be reduced. The\nmultiplicities of local polar varieties are related to local topological\ninvariants, local vanishing Euler-Poincar\\'e characteristics, by a formula\nwhich turns out to contain, in the special case where the singularity is the\nvertex of the cone over a reduced projective variety, a Pl\\\"ucker-type formula\nfor the degree of the dual of a projective variety.

Previously, such invariants were known only in\ndimensions $2$ and $3$ from the work of Welschinger. Our approach does not\nrequire the Lagrangian to be fixed by an anti-symplectic involution, but can\nuse such an involution, if present, to obtain stronger results. Also,\nnon-trivial invariants are defined for broader classes of interior constraints\nand Lagrangian submanifolds than previously possible even in the presence of an\nanti-symplectic involution. The invariants of the present work specialize to\ninvariants of Welschinger, Fukaya, and Georgieva in many instances.\n  The main obstacle to defining open Gromov-Witten invariants with boundary\nconstraints in arbitrary dimension is the bubbling of $J$-holomorphic disks.\nUnlike in low dimensions or for interior constraints, disk bubbles do not\ncancel in pairs by anti-symplectic involution symmetry. Rather, we use the\ntechnique of bounding chains introduced in Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono's work on\nLagrangian Floer theory to cancel disk bubbling.

The said\nlattice eventually coincides with the lattice of all orthogonal projectors on a\nseparable Hilbert space over R, C, or over the algebra of quaternions H.\nQuantum states are $\\sigma$-additive probability measures on that non-Boolean\nlattice. Gleason's theorem proves that, if the Hilbert space is separable with\ndimension >2 and the Hilbert space is either real or complex, then states are\none-to-one with standard density matrices (self-adjoint, positive, unit-trace,\ntrace-class operators). The extension of this result to quaternionic Hilbert\nspaces was obtained by Varadarajan in 1968. Unfortunately, even if the hard\npart of the proof is correct, the formulation of this extension is\nmathematically incorrect. This is due to some peculiarities of the notion of\ntrace in quaternionic Hilbert spaces, e.g., basis dependence, making the theory\nof trace-class operators in quaternionic Hilbert spaces different from the\nstandard theory in real and complex Hilbert spaces. A minor issue also affects\nVaradarajan's statement for real Hilbert space formulation. This paper is\nmainly devoted to present Gleason-Varadarajan's theorem into a technically\ncorrect form valid for the three types of Hilbert spaces. After having develped\npart of the general mathematical technology of trace-class operators in\n(generally non-separable) quaternionic Hilbert spaces, we prove that only the\n{\\em real part} of the trace enters the formalism of quantum theories (also\ndealing with unbounded observables and symmetries) and it can be safely used to\nformulate and prove a common statement of Gleason's theorem. \n\n"}

Integrable\n  structure and isomonodromic Green's function Abstract: Two discretizations, linear and nonlinear, of basic notions of the complex\nanalysis are considered. The underlying lattice is an arbitrary quasicrystallic\nrhombic tiling of a plane. The linear theory is based on the discrete\nCauchy-Riemann equations, the nonlinear one is based on the notion of circle\npatterns. We clarify the role of the rhombic condition in both theories: under\nthis condition the corresponding equations are integrable (in the sense of 3D\nconsistency, which yields also the existense of zero curvature representations,\nB\"acklund transformations etc.). We demonstrate that in some precise sense the\nlinear theory is a linearization of the nonlinear one: the tangent space to a\nset of integrable circle patterns at an isoradial point consists of discrete\nholomorphic functions which take real (imaginary) values on two sublattices. We\nextend solutions of the basic equations of both theories to Z^d, where d is the\nnumber of different edge slopes of the quasicrystallic tiling. In the linear\ntheory, we give an integral representation of an arbitrary discrete holomorphic\nfunction, thus proving the density of discrete exponential functions. We\nintroduce the d-dimensional discrete logarithmic function which is a\ngeneralization of Kenyon's discrete Green's function, and uncover several new\nproperties of this function.

Generalized de Bruijn-Springer relations Abstract: A notion of weighted multivariate majorization is defined as a preorder on\nsequences of vectors in Euclidean space induced by the Choquet ordering for\natomic probability measures. We characterize this preorder both in terms of\nstochastic matrices and convex functions and use it to describe the\ndistribution of equilibrium points of logarithmic potentials generated by\ndiscrete planar charge configurations.

A\ncomplete study of various double reflection conditions is also provided. \n\n"}

The\ninvestigation of a simplest among those domains, the quantum matrix ball, was\nstarted in math.QA/9803110. This work presents a construction of q-analogues\nfor Hardy-Bergman spaces of 'functions in those balls', together with an\nexplicit form of the Bergman kernel.\n  Besides that, two auxiliary results are also established: a boundedness of\nmatrix balls is proved, and de Rham complexes of differential forms with finite\ncoefficients in those balls are constructed. \n\n"}
