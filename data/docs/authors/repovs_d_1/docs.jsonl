There has been considerable interest in whether certain such\nfunctions are injective. For example, it is a famous open problem whether the\nWhitehead double operator is weakly injective (an operator is called weakly\ninjective if P(K)=P(0) implies K=0 where 0 is the class of the trivial knot).\nWe prove that, modulo the smooth 4-dimensional Poincare Conjecture, any strong\nwinding number one satellite operator is injective on C.

The model is functorial in the sense that\nthere is an easily computable map that induces isomorphisms between the natural\nsubdivisions of the attractor of the model and the self-affine tile.

{"id": "1404.6516", "contents": "Title: A perspective on non-commutative frame theory Abstract: This paper extends the fundamental results of frame theory to a\nnon-commutative setting where the role of locales is taken over by \\'etale\nlocalic categories. This involves ideas from quantale theory and from semigroup\ntheory, specifically Ehresmann semigroups, restriction semigroups and inverse\nsemigroups. We establish a duality between the category of complete restriction\nmonoids and the category of \\'etale localic categories. The relationship\nbetween monoids and categories is mediated by a class of quantales called\nrestriction quantal frames. This result builds on the work of Pedro Resende on\nthe connection between pseudogroups and \\'etale localic groupoids but in the\nprocess we both generalize and simplify: for example, we do not require\ninvolutions and, in addition, we render his result functorial. We also project\ndown to topological spaces and, as a result, extend the classical adjunction\nbetween locales and topological spaces to an adjunction between \\'etale localic\ncategories and \\'etale topological categories. In fact, varying morphisms, we\nobtain several adjunctions. Just as in the commutative case, we restrict these\nadjunctions to spatial-sober and coherent-spectral equivalences. The classical\nequivalence between coherent frames and distributive lattices is extended to an\nequivalence between coherent complete restriction monoids and distributive\nrestriction semigroups. Consequently, we deduce several dualities between\ndistributive restriction semigroups and spectral \\'etale topological\ncategories. We also specialize these dualities for the setting where the\ntopological categories are cancellative or are groupoids. Our approach thus\nlinks, unifies and extends the approaches taken in the work by Lawson and Lenz\nand by Resende. \n\n"}

Lines and planes are unified via the\nconcept of separation: lines are separated into two components by each point,\nplanes contain lines that separate them into two components as well. We add a\nsubgroup of bijections preserving line segments and establishing unique\nisomorphism of basic geometrical sets, and the axiomatic structure is complete.\nOf fundamental importance is the Fixed Point Theorem that allows for creation\nof the concepts of length and congruency of line segments.

In particular, $g$ has a\ngeneral type, which is an extension of the type of an adapted metric. A\nrestriction on this general type is assumed, and then $g$ is called good. We\nconsider the maximum/minimun ideal boundary condition, $d_{\\text{\\rm\nmax/min}}$, of the compactly supported de~Rham complex on $M$, in the sense of\nBr\\\"uning-Lesch.

The\nfirst main theorem states that $\\Delta_{\\text{\\rm max/min}}$ has a discrete\nspectrum satisfying a weak form of the Weyl's asymptotic formula. The second\nmain theorem is a version of Morse inequalities using $H_{\\text{\\rm\nmax/min}}^*(M)$ and what we call rel-Morse functions.

We take into account discrete dynamical systems, that is, pairs\n$(X,T)$, where $X$ is the underlying space and $T:X\\to X$ a transformation. We\nsee entropies as functions $h:\\mathfrak X\\to \\mathbb R_+$, associating to each\nflow $(X,T)$ of a category $\\mathfrak X$ either a non negative real or\n$\\infty$. We introduce the notion of semigroup entropy $h_\\mathfrak S:\\mathfrak\nS\\to\\mathbb R_+$, which is a numerical invariant attached to endomorphisms of\nthe category $\\mathfrak S$ of normed semigroups. Then, for a functor\n$F:\\mathfrak X\\to\\mathfrak S$ from any specific category $\\mathfrak X$ to\n$\\mathfrak S$, we define the functorial entropy $h_F:\\mathfrak X\\to\\mathbb R_+$\nas the composition $h_{\\mathfrak S}\\circ F$. Clearly, $h_F$ inherits many of\nthe properties of $h_\\mathfrak S$, depending also on the properties of $F$.\nSuch general scheme permits to obtain relevant known entropies as functorial\nentropies $h_F$, for appropriate categories $\\mathfrak X$ and functors $F$, and\nto establish the properties shared by them. In this way we point out their\ncommon nature. Finally, we discuss and deeply analyze through the looking glass\nof our unifying approach the relations between pairs of entropies. To this end\nwe formalize the notion of Bridge Theorem between two entropies $h_i:\\mathfrak\nX_i\\to \\mathbb R_+$, $i=1,2$, with respect to a functor $\\varepsilon:\\mathfrak\nX_1\\to\\mathfrak X_2$. Then, for pairs of functorial entropies we use the above\nscheme to introduce the notion and the related scheme of Strong Bridge Theorem,\nwhich allows us to put under the same umbrella various relations between pairs\nof entropies. \n\n"}

These\nsurfaces with boundary are called braided 3-belts (or simply belts). Twisting\nand braiding of ribbons composing braided 3-belts are interchangeable, and it\nwas shown in the literature that any braided 3-belt can be written in a pure\ntwist form, specified by a vector of three multiples of half integers [a,b,c],\na topological invariant.\n  This paper identifies the set of braided 3-belts that can be written in a\nbraid only form in which all twisting is eliminated. For these braids an\nalgorithm to calculate the braid word is determined which allows the braid only\nword of every braided 3-belt to be written in a canonical form. It is\nfurthermore demonstrated that the set of braided 3-belts do not form a group,\ndue to a lack of isogeny.\n  The conditions under which the boundary of a braided 3-belt is a knot are\ndetermined, and a formula for the Jones polynomial for knotted boundaries is\nderived.
