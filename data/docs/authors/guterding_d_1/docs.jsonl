The checkerboard effectively pins the vortex lattice, when the\nperiod of the latter is commensurate with the period of the checkerboard.

The self-energy of electrons is\ndecomposed into the single-site and multisite ones. It is proved by using the\nmapping of the single-site one in the t-J model to its corresponding one in the\nAnderson model that the single-site self-energy is that of a normal Fermi\nliquid, even if a superconducting (SC) order parameter appears or the multisite\none is anomalous. The electron liquid characterized by the single-site\nself-energy is a normal Fermi liquid. The Fermi liquid is further stabilized by\nthe RVB mechanism. The stabilized Fermi liquid is a relevant unperturbed state\nthat can be used to study superconductivity and anomalous Fermi-liquid\nbehaviors. The so-called spin-fluctuation-mediated exchange interaction, which\nincludes the superexchange interaction as a part, is the attractive interaction\nthat binds d-wave Cooper pairs.

At high temperatures, the coefficient of the $T$-linear resistivity\nis essentially doping independent beyond a critical doping $p_{\\rm crit}$ =\n0.19 at which the ratio of the two coefficients is maximal.

Using\nLondon theory it is demonstrated that at sufficiently small applied and chiral\nfields the existence of domain walls and vortices in the sample is not favored\nand the sample's configuration is a single domain. The particular chirality of\nthe single-domain configuration is neither favored nor disfavored by the\napplied field. Increasing the field leads to an entry of a domain wall loop or\na vortex into the sample. Formation of a straight domain wall is never\npreferred in equilibrium. Values of the entry (critical) fields for both types\nof defects, as well as the equilibrium size of the domain wall loop, are\ncalculated. We also consider a mesoscopic chiral sample and calculate its\nzero-field magnetization, susceptibility and a change in the magnetic moment\ndue to a vortex or a domain wall entry.

The isothermal magnetic field ($H||c$ axis)\ndependent magnetization ($M$) loops exhibit a second peak (SP) or `fishtail\neffect', as well as remarkable flux jumps at low temperatures. The critical\ncurrent density $J_c$ obtained from the $M(H)$ loops is rather high, of the\norder of 10$^6$ A/cm$^2$. The analysis of the temperature and field dependent\n$J_c$ implies that high $J_c$ is mainly due to collective (weak) pinning of\nvortices by dense microscopic point defects with some contribution from a\nstrong pinning mechanism. Pronounced magnetic instabilities in terms of flux\njumps depend strongly on temperature as well on the field sweep rate.

We study the effects impurities on\nthis charge ordered phase via a single-band model in which bond order is the\nanalogue of charge order in the cuprates. Impurities are assumed to be\npointlike and are treated within the self-consistent t-matrix approximation\n(SCTMA). We show that suppression of bond order by impurities occurs through\nthe local disruption of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ form factor near individual\nimpurities. Unlike $d$-wave superconductors, where the sensitivity of $T_c$ to\nimpurities can be traced to a vanishing average of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ order\nparameter over the Fermi surface, the response of bond order to impurities is\ndictated by a few Fermi surface \"hotspots\". The bond order transition\ntemperature $T_\\mathrm{bo}$ thus follows a different universal dependence on\nimpurity concentration $n_i$ than does the superconducting $T_c$. In\nparticular, $T_\\mathrm{bo}$ decreases more rapidly than $T_c$ with increasing\n$n_i$ when there is a nonzero Fermi surface curvature at the hotspots.

First,\nwe show that by appropriately screening the one- and two-electron integrals of\nthe Hamiltonian one can improve the efficiency of the algorithm by several\norders of magnitude. This improved efficiency comes with the added benefit that\nthe resulting algorithm scales as the second power of the system size $O(N^2)$,\ndown from the fourth power $O(N^4)$. Using numerical results, we demonstrate\nthat the practical scaling obtained is in fact $O(N^{1.5})$ for a chain of\nHydrogen atoms, and $O(N^{1.2})$ for the Hubbard model. Second, we introduce\nthe use of the rejection-free continuous time Monte Carlo (CTMC) to sample the\ndeterminants. CTMC is usually prohibitively expensive because of the need to\ncalculate a large number of intermediates. Here, we take advantage of the fact\nthat these intermediates are already calculated during the evaluation of the\nlocal energy and consequently, just by storing them one can use the CTCM\nalgorithm with virtually no overhead. Third, we show that by using the adaptive\nstochastic gradient descent algorithm called AMSGrad one can optimize the\nwavefunction energies robustly and efficiently.

The metallic behavior of\nresistance is explained as result of activation of localized electrons to\nconductance band leading to a suppression of non-linear screening of the\ndisorder potential. The magnetoresistance (MR) in the critical region is\nrelated to depopulation of double occupied localized states also leading to\npartial suppression of the nonlinear screening. The most informative data are\nrelated to nearly activated temperature dependence of MR in strongly insulating\nlimit (which can be in particular reached from the metallic state in high\nenough fields).

We find that these spin chains, even with {\\em\narbitrary} coefficients of these interactions, have a symmetry algebra A_m much\nlarger than U(m), which implies that the energy eigenstates fall into sectors\nthat for open chains (i.e., free boundary conditions) can be labeled by j=0, 1,\n>..., L, for the 2L-site chain, such that the degeneracies of all eigenvalues\nin the jth sector are generically the same and increase rapidly with j. For\nlarge j, these degeneracies are much larger than those that would be expected\nfrom the U(m) symmetry alone. The enlarged symmetry algebra A_m(2L) consists of\noperators that commute in this space of states with the Temperley-Lieb algebra\nthat is generated by the set of nearest-neighbor interaction terms; A_m(2L) is\nnot a Yangian. There are similar results for supersymmetric chains with\ngl(m+n|n) symmetry of nearest-neighbor interactions, and a richer\nrepresentation structure for closed chains (i.e., periodic boundary\nconditions). The symmetries also apply to the loop models that can be obtained\nfrom the spin chains in a spacetime or transfer matrix picture. In the loop\nlanguage, the symmetries arise because the loops cannot cross. We further\ndefine tensor products of representations (for the open chains) by joining\nchains end to end. The fusion rules for decomposing the tensor product of\nrepresentations labeled j_1 and j_2 take the same form as the Clebsch-Gordan\nseries for SU(2). This and other structures turn the symmetry algebra \\cA_m\ninto a ribbon Hopf algebra, and we show that this is ``Morita equivalent'' to\nthe quantum group U_q(sl_2) for m=q+q^{-1}.

Pseudogap\nformations have been observed in both the density of states and the spectral\nfunction at the Fermi level. The pseudogap in the spectral function is\nexplained by the non-Fermi-liquid-like nature of the self-energy. The anomalous\nbehavior in the self-energy is caused by both the strong antiferromagnetic spin\nfluctuation and the nesting condition on the non-interacting Fermi surface. In\nthe present approximation, we find a logarithmic singularity in the integrand\nof the imaginary part of the self-energy.

A selforganized 3-band structure of the model is obtained in the\nmagnetically ordered phase. Deviation from half filling generates a central\nnonmagnetic band, which becomes sharply separated at T=0 by (pseudo)gaps from\nupper and lower magnetic bands. Replica symmetry breaking effects are derived\nfor several observables and correlations.

The result gives an estimate of the electron spectral function for\nnonzero magnetic field and Kondo temperature, with consequences for transport\nexperiments on quantum dots in the Kondo regime. The strong correlations of the\nKondo ground state cause a significant low-temperature reduction of the peak\nsplitting. Explicit formulae are found for the shift and broadening of the\nKondo peaks. A likely cause of the problems of large-N approaches to spin-1/2\nimpurities at finite magnetic field is suggested. \n\n"}

The spins are arrayed as s_a-s_a-s_b-s_b in a unit\ncell and the exchange couplings are accordingly periodic with period 4. The\nspin Hamiltonian is mapped onto a nonlinear $\\sigma$ model based on the general\nformula for periodic inhomogeneous spin chains. The gapless condition given by\nthe nonlinear $\\sigma$ model determines boundaries between disordered phases in\nthe space of the exchange parameters. The phase diagram has a rich phase\nstructure characterized by the values of s_a and s_b. We explain all phases in\nthe singlet-cluster-solid picture which is an extension of the\nvalence-bond-solid picture. \n\n"}

Using an electronic theory we calculate in\nparticular for the underdoped cuprate superconductors the superfluid density\n$n_s(T)$, the superconducting transition temperature $T_c(x) \\propto n_s$ below\nwhich phase coherent Cooper-pairs occur, and $T_c^{*}(x)$ where the phase\nincoherent Cooper-pairs disappear. Also we present results for the penetration\ndepth $\\lambda(x,T)$ and for the weak pseudogap temperature $T^{*}(x)$ at which\na gap structure occurs in the spectral density. A Mei{\\ss}ner effect is\nobtained only for $T < T_c$. We find that phase fluctuations become\nincreasingly important in the underdoped regime and lead to a reduction of\n$T_c$ in good agreement with the experimental situation. \n\n"}

In the Ni-substituted\nsystem, the magnetic resonance peak (which is observed at E$_r \\simeq$40 meV in\nthe pure system) shifts to lower energy with a preserved E$_r$/T$_c$ ratio\nwhile the shift is much smaller upon Zn substitution. By contrast Zn, but not\nNi, restores significant spin fluctuations around 40 meV in the normal state.\nThese observations are discussed in the light of models proposed for the\nmagnetic resonance peak. \n\n"}

These objects, which carry rational or irrational quantum\nnumbers, are classified into universal classes $h$ of particles or\nquasiparticles which obey specific fractal distribution function. We show that\nthe relaxation time associated to Hall conductivity for the superconducting\ncuprate systems came to out as $\\tau_{H}\\propto T^{-2}$. We also consider the\npairing of fractons as a mechanism to produce bosonic systems and therefore\nsuperconducting states. For that an effective mass obtained from the propagator\nof a charge-flux system is considered. In this way, some experimental results\nof infrared studies of the cuprates for the effective mass,\n$m^*=m_{e}(1+\\lambda)$, compared with our effective mass expression,\n$m_{eff}=m(1+s)$, show us that the dominant factor for interactions came from\nthe spin. Thus spin flutuactions as a mechanism of high-$T_{c}$\nsuperconductivity and fractons as quasiparticles are related. An expression to\nthe low temperature specific heat of a quantum liquid of fractons is also\nobtained. \n\n"}
