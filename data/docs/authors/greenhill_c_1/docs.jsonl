Roughly speaking, there is one model for each {\\em kernel}, i.e., each\nsymmetric measurable function from $[0,1]^2$ to the non-negative reals,\nalthough the details are much more complicated. A different connection between\nkernels and random graphs arises in the recent work of Borgs, Chayes, Lov\\'asz,\nS\\'os, Szegedy and Vesztergombi. They introduced several natural metrics on\ndense graphs (graphs with $n$ vertices and $\\Theta(n^2)$ edges), showed that\nthese metrics are equivalent, and gave a description of the completion of the\nspace of all graphs with respect to any of these metrics in terms of {\\em\ngraphons}, which are essentially bounded kernels. One of the most appealing\naspects of this work is the message that sequences of inhomogeneous\nquasi-random graphs are in a sense completely general: any sequence of dense\ngraphs contains such a subsequence.\n  Our aim here is to briefly survey these results, and then to investigate to\nwhat extent they can be generalized to graphs with $o(n^2)$ edges. Although\nmany of the definitions extend in a simple way, the connections between the\nvarious metrics, and between the metrics and random graph models, turn out to\nbe much more complicated than in the dense case. We shall prove many partial\nresults, and state even more conjectures and open problems, whose resolution\nwould greatly enhance the currently rather unsatisfactory theory of metrics on\nsparse graphs.

In this\narticle, we define a generalization of Schnyder woods to $d$-angulations (plane\ngraphs with faces of degree $d$) for all $d\\geq 3$. A \\emph{Schnyder\ndecomposition} is a set of $d$ spanning forests crossing each other in a\nspecific way, and such that each internal edge is part of exactly $d-2$ of the\nspanning forests. We show that a Schnyder decomposition exists if and only if\nthe girth of the $d$-angulation is $d$. As in the case of Schnyder woods\n($d=3$), there are alternative formulations in terms of orientations\n(\"fractional\" orientations when $d\\geq 5$) and in terms of corner-labellings.\nMoreover, the set of Schnyder decompositions on a fixed $d$-angulation of girth\n$d$ is a distributive lattice.

Additionally, for even values of $d$, we show that a subclass of\nSchnyder decompositions, which are called even, enjoy additional properties\nthat yield a reduced formulation; in the case d=4, these correspond to\nwell-studied structures on simple quadrangulations (2-orientations and\npartitions into 2 spanning trees). In the case d=4, the dual of even Schnyder\ndecompositions yields (planar) orthogonal and straight-line drawing algorithms.\nFor a 4-regular plane graph $G$ of mincut 4 with $n$ vertices plus a marked\nvertex $v$, the vertices of $G\\backslash v$ are placed on a $(n-1) \\times\n(n-1)$ grid according to a permutation pattern, and in the orthogonal drawing\neach of the $2n-2$ edges of $G\\backslash v$ has exactly one bend.

In the infinite setting we are interested in\ndetermining when this limit is unique and when there is phase coexistence,\ni.e., existence of multiple Gibbs states.

It has been\nverified for conservative problems (also known as list homomorphism problems)\nby A. Bulatov (2003). We augment this result by showing that for digraph\ntemplates H, every conservative CSP, denoted LHOM(H), is solvable in logspace\nor is hard for NL. More precisely, we introduce a digraph structure we call a\ncircular N, and prove the following dichotomy: if H contains no circular N then\nLHOM(H) admits a logspace algorithm, and otherwise LHOM(H) is hard for NL. Our\nalgorithm operates by reducing the lists in a complex manner based on a novel\ndecomposition of an auxiliary digraph, combined with repeated applications of\nReingold's algorithm for undirected reachability (2005). We also prove an\nalgebraic version of this dichotomy: the digraphs without a circular N are\nprecisely those that admit a finite chain of polymorphisms satisfying the\nHagemann-Mitschke identities. This confirms a conjecture of Larose and Tesson\n(2007) for LHOM(H). Moreover, we show that the presence of a circular N can be\ndecided in time polynomial in the size of H. \n\n"}

These chains describe the\nbreaking-then-recombining of the combinatorial objects in the Hopf algebra. The\nmotivating example is the famous Gilbert-Shannon-Reeds model of\nriffle-shuffling of a deck of cards, which arises in this manner from the\nshuffle algebra.\n  The primary reason for constructing Hopf-power Markov chains, or for\nrephrasing familiar chains through this lens, is that much information about\nthem comes simply from translating well-known facts on the underlying Hopf\nalgebra. For example, there is an explicit formula for the stationary\ndistribution (Theorem 4.5.1), and constructing quotient algebras show that\ncertain statistics on a Hopf-power Markov chain are themselves Markov chains\n(Theorem 4.7.1).

It postulates the existence of an\nasymptotically optimal online BST, i.e. one that is constant factor competitive\nwith any BST on any input access sequence. The two main candidates for dynamic\noptimality in the literature are splay trees [Sleator and Tarjan, 1985], and\nGreedy [Lucas, 1988; Munro, 2000; Demaine et al. 2009] [..]\n  Dynamic optimality is trivial for almost all sequences: the optimum access\ncost of most length-n sequences is Theta(n log n), achievable by any balanced\nBST. Thus, the obvious missing step towards the conjecture is an understanding\nof the \"easy\" access sequences. [..] The difficulty of proving dynamic\noptimality is witnessed by highly restricted special cases that remain\nunresolved; one prominent example is the traversal conjecture [Sleator and\nTarjan, 1985], which states that preorder sequences (whose optimum is linear)\nare linear-time accessed by splay trees; no online BST is known to satisfy this\nconjecture.\n  In this paper, we prove two different relaxations of the traversal conjecture\nfor Greedy: (i) Greedy is almost linear for preorder traversal, (ii) if a\nlinear-time preprocessing is allowed, Greedy is in fact linear. These\nstatements are corollaries of our more general results that express the\ncomplexity of access sequences in terms of a pattern avoidance parameter k.\n[..] To our knowledge, these are the first upper bounds for Greedy that are not\nknown to hold for any other online BST.

In two dimensions,\nthis means counting walks in the first quadrant of the plane (possibly after a\nlinear transformation). But what about walks in non-convex cones? We\ninvestigate the two most natural cases: first, square lattice walks avoiding\nthe negative quadrant Q 1 = {(i, j) : i \\textless{} 0 and j \\textless{} 0}, and\nthen, square lattice walks avoiding the West quadrant Q 2 = {(i, j) : i\n\\textless{} j and i \\textless{} --j}. In both cases, the generating function\nthat counts walks starting from the origin is found to differ from a simple\nD-finite series by an algebraic one. We also obtain closed form expressions for\nthe number of n-step walks ending at certain prescribed endpoints, as a sum of\nthree hypergeometric terms.

An example of a quadratic\nvaluation is the Wu characteristic w(G) which sums (-1)^(dim(x)+dim(y)) over\nall intersecting pairs of complete subgraphs x,y of a G. More generally, an\nintersection number w(A,B) sums (-1)^(dim(x)+dim(y)) over pairs x,y, where x is\nin A and y is in B and x,y intersect. w(G) is a quadratic Euler characteristic\nX(G), where X sums (-1)^dim(x) over all complete subgraphs x of G.

Here we study whether such stochastic control is also\npossible in a noisy environment, where both the process of state-observation\nand the process of state-evolution are subject to adversarial perturbation\n(noise).

To overcome this\nchallenge we develop a new analysis where entropy plays a central role, both to\nmeasure the rate at which progress towards an acceptable state is made and the\nrate at which noise undoes this progress.

The minimum number of colors\nnecessary in such a coloring is the strong rainbow connection number\n($\\src(G)$) of the graph. When proving upper bounds on $\\src(G)$, it is natural\nto prove that a coloring exists where, for \\emph{every} shortest path between\nevery pair of vertices in the graph, all edges of the path receive different\ncolors. Therefore, we introduce and formally define this more restricted edge\ncoloring number, which we call \\emph{very strong rainbow connection number}\n($\\vsrc(G)$).\n  In this paper, we give upper bounds on $\\vsrc(G)$ for several graph classes,\nsome of which are tight.

In particular, we prove\nthat every simple near-bipartite brick $G$ has an edge $e$ so that the graph\nobtained from $G-e$ by contracting each edge that is incident with a vertex of\ndegree two is also a simple near-bipartite brick, unless $G$ belongs to any of\neight well-defined infinite families. This is a refinement of the brick\ngeneration theorem of Norine and Thomas (Generating Bricks, J. Combin. Theory\nSer. B, 2007) which is appropriate for the restricted class of near-bipartite\nbricks.\n  Earlier, the first author (Generating near-bipartite bricks, J.

In fact, it is non-trivial to create challenging\ninstances for such solvers and the number of difficult benchmark graphs\navailable is quite limited. We describe a construction to efficiently generate\nsmall instances for the graph isomorphism problem that are difficult or even\ninfeasible for said solvers. Up to this point the only other available\ninstances posing challenges for isomorphism solvers were certain incidence\nstructures of combinatorial objects (such as projective planes, Hadamard\nmatrices, Latin squares, etc.). Experiments show that starting from 1500\nvertices our new instances are several orders of magnitude more difficult on\ncomparable input sizes.

A subgraph $H \\subseteq G$ is an\n$f$ vertex fault tolerant (VFT) $k$-spanner if $H \\setminus F$ is a $k$-spanner\nof $G \\setminus F$ for any small set $F$ of $f$ vertices that might \"fail.\" One\nof the main questions in the area is: what is the minimum size of an $f$ fault\ntolerant $k$-spanner that holds for all $n$ node graphs (as a function of $f$,\n$k$ and $n$)? This question was first studied in the context of geometric\ngraphs [Levcopoulos et al.

This is the first general transformation\nbetween the two families of data structures.\n  There is a rich theory of dynamic optimality for BSTs (i.e. the theory of\ncompetitiveness between BST algorithms). The lack of an analogous theory for\nheaps has been noted in the literature. Through our connection, we transfer all\ninstance-specific lower bounds known for BSTs to a general model of heaps,\ninitiating a theory of dynamic optimality for heaps.\n  On the algorithmic side, we obtain a new, simple and efficient heap\nalgorithm, which we call the smooth heap.

Three reduction operations for alternating dimaps were\ninvestigated by Farr. A minor of an alternating dimap can be obtained by\nreducing some of its edges using the reduction operations. Unlike classical\nminor operations, these reduction operations do not commute in general. A Tutte\ninvariant for alternating dimaps is a function $ P $ defined on every\nalternating dimap and taking values in a field such that $ P $ is invariant\nunder isomorphism and obeys a linear recurrence relation involving reduction\noperations. It is well known that if a graph $ G $ is planar, then the Tutte\npolynomial $ T $ satisfies $ T(G;x,y)=T(G^{*};y,x) $. We note an analogous\nrelation for the extended Tutte invariants for alternating dimaps introduced by\nFarr. We then characterise the Tutte invariant for alternating dimaps of genus\nzero under several conditions. As a result of the non-commutativity of the\nreduction operations, the recursions based on them cannot always be satisfied.\nWe investigate the properties of alternating dimaps of genus zero that are\nrequired in order to obtain a well defined Tutte invariant.

We solve some enumerative\nconjectures left open by the foundational work on the topics by Corteel et al.,\nsome of these being also solved independently by Lin, and Kim and Lin. The\nstrength of our approach is its robustness: we enumerate four families $F_1\n\\subset F_2 \\subset F_3 \\subset F_4$ of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences\nordered by inclusion using the same approach. More precisely, we provide a\ngenerating tree (with associated succession rule) for each family $F_i$ which\ngeneralizes the one for the family $F_{i-1}$.\n  The second topic of the paper is the enumeration of a fifth family $F_5$ of\npattern-avoiding inversion sequences (containing $F_4$). This enumeration is\nalso solved \\emph{via} a succession rule, which however does not generalize the\none for $F_4$. The associated enumeration sequence, which we call the\n\\emph{powered Catalan numbers}, is quite intriguing, and further investigated.\nWe provide two different succession rules for it, denoted $\\Omega_{pCat}$ and\n$\\Omega_{steady}$, and show that they define two types of families enumerated\nby powered Catalan numbers. Among such families, we introduce the \\emph{steady\npaths}, which are naturally associated with $\\Omega_{steady}$.

On the other hand, many graph classes can be\nefficiently recognized by techniques based on some interesting orderings of the\nnodes, such as the ones given by traversals.\n  We study specifically graph classes that have an ordering avoiding some\nordered structures. More precisely, we consider what we call patterns on three\nnodes, and the recognition complexity of the associated classes. In this\ndomain, there are two key previous works.

Our proofs use new tools for upper\nbounding the asymptotic slice rank of a wide range of tensors. Our main result\nis that the Universal method applied to any Coppersmith-Winograd tensor $CW_q$\ncannot yield a bound on $\\omega$, the exponent of matrix multiplication, better\nthan $2.16805$. By comparison, it was previously only known that the weaker\n`Galactic Method' applied to $CW_q$ could not achieve an exponent of $2$.\n  We also study the Laser Method (which is, in principle, a highly special case\nof the Universal Method) and prove that it is \"complete\" for matrix\nmultiplication algorithms: when it applies to a tensor $T$, it achieves $\\omega\n= 2$ if and only if it is possible for the Universal method applied to $T$ to\nachieve $\\omega = 2$.

Our methods\nrefine existing rank tests of non-parametric statistics, such as the sign test\nand the runs test, and are useful for exploratory analysis of ordinal data. We\nestablish a bijection between convex rank tests and probabilistic conditional\nindependence structures known as semigraphoids. The subclass of submodular rank\ntests is derived from faces of the cone of submodular functions, or from\nMinkowski summands of the permutohedron. We enumerate all small instances of\nsuch rank tests. Of particular interest are graphical tests, which correspond\nto both graphical models and to graph associahedra. \n\n"}

The Meixner ensemble is\nrelated to a two-dimensional directed growth model, and the Charlier ensemble\nis related to the lengths of weakly increasing subsequences in random words.\nThe Krawtchouk ensemble occurs in connection with zig-zag paths in random\ndomino tilings of the Aztec diamond, and also in a certain simplified directed\nfirst-passage percolation model.
