This phase emerges because the molecules may interact with\neach other via a potential V_0(r) that has an attractive dipole-dipole 1/r^3\ntail, which provides p-wave superfluid pairing at fairly high temperatures. We\ncalculate the amplitude of elastic p-wave scattering in the potential V_0(r)\ntaking into account both the anomalous scattering due to the dipole-dipole tail\nand the short-range contribution. This amplitude is then used for the\nanalytical and numerical solution of the renormalized BCS gap equation which\nincludes the second order Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov corrections and the\ncorrection related to the effective mass of the quasiparticles. We find that\nthe critical temperature T_c can be varied within a few orders of magnitude by\nmodifying the short-range part of the potential V_0(r).

Therefore colloidal suspensions are frequently argued to be an\nideal toy model for experimentally more difficult systems such as metal melts.\nIn this letter, we want to challenge this assumption. To this aim, we have\nconsidered molecular dynamics simulations of the crystallization in a\nsuspension of Yukawa-type colloids.

Our simulations show a dramatic\nreduction of the crystal growth velocity due to HIs even at moderate\nhydrodynamic coupling. A detailed analysis shows that this slowdown is due to\nthe wall-like properties of the crystal surface, which reduces the colloidal\ndiffusion towards the crystal surface by hydrodynamic screening.\nCrystallization in suspensions therefore differs strongly from pure melts,\nmaking them less useful as a toy model than previously thought. \n\n"}

Here, we present first experimental evidence for this topological\ntransition in the bulk band of a doped TI. Our theoretical calculations, and\nnumerical modeling link abrupt changes in the critical current of top-gated\nTIJJs to moving the chemical potential in the charge-accumulation region on the\nsurface of the doped TI across a band-inversion point. We demonstrate that the\ncritical-current changes originate from a shift of the spatial location of\nlow-energy ABS from the surface to the boundary between topologically-trivial\nand band-inverted regions after the transition. The appearance of a decay\nchannel for surface ABS is related to the vanishing of the band effective mass\nin the bulk and thus exemplifies the topological character of surface ABS as\nboundary modes. Importantly, the mechanism suggest a means of manipulating\nMajorana modes in future experiments. \n\n"}

We use a coarse-grained model of DNA to\ncharacterize such bulged duplexes. We find that this motif can adopt structures\nbelonging to two main classes: one where the stacking of the helices at the\ncenter of the system is preserved, the geometry is roughly straight and the\nbulge is on one side of the duplex, and the other where the stacking at the\ncenter is broken, thus allowing this junction to act as a hinge and increasing\nflexibility.

This phenomenon,\nreferred to as chaos assisted tunneling, is characterized by large fluctuations\nof the tunneling rate when a parameter is varied. To date the full extent of\nthis effect as well as the associated statistical distribution have never been\nobserved in a quantum system. Here we analyze the possibility of characterizing\nthese effects accurately in a cold atom experiment. Using realistic values of\nthe parameters of an experimental setup, we examine through analytical\nestimates and extensive numerical simulations a specific system that can be\nimplemented with cold atoms, the atomic modulated pendulum. We assess the\nefficiency of three possible routes to observe in detail chaos assisted\ntunneling properties.

It is\nshown that a two band model provides a consistent interpretation of the\ntemperature dependence of the normal state resistance and the Hall constant.\nWhereas band structure calculations suggest an increase in T_c upon partial\nsubstitution of Ni with Fe and Co, Co substitution quenches superconductivity\nand Fe substitution leads to an increase followed by a decrease in T_c. The\nobserved variation of T_c may be explained in terms of a competition between\nincrease in T_c due to increase in density of states and a decrease due to spin\nfluctuations. Based on these results, it is suggested that the spin\nfluctuations are weaker in Fe doped samples as compared to the Co doped ones.\nAn initial decrease in T_c (and the normal state resistance) followed by an\nincrease is observed on application of pressure. The decrease in T_c for small\napplied pressures can be understood in terms of the decrease in the density of\nstates at the Fermi level. The subsequent increase in T_c with pressure is due\nto a lattice softening or a structural phase transition, consistent with the\nband structure calculations.

Two-Component Nonstoichiometric Compounds and the\n  Insulator--Superconductor--Metal Transition Abstract: One of the reasons for the lack of understanding of both the mechanisms\nunderlying the HTSC phenomenon and of the instability of materials with Tc >\n300 K may be the widely accepted but wrong ideas about the types of chemical\nbonding in a substance and the radii of the atoms and ions. A revision of these\nconcepts started in the beginning of the XX century in connection with the\ninvestigation of non-stoichiometric compounds (the berthollides) but did not\nreach a critical level until recently. Most of the HTSC materials, however, are\nactually non-stoichiometric nanocomposites, whose components \"dilute\" or\n\"stretch\" one another. Each component resides in an \"intermediate\" state, which\nstill remains poorly studied. For instance, in a system of particles having two\npaired electrons each, the unbroken electron pairs may start tunneling at a\ncertain \"medium\" concentration with the system becoming a Bose superconductor\n(the state between the insulator and the metal with BCS superconductivity). For\nunivalent atoms (Na,Ag), however, such possibility realizes neither in\nintermediate nor in the final state. Univalent metals are not superconductors.\nIn the berthollides, however, a possible Jahn-Teller-Peierls-type instability\nmay give rise to formation of diatomic molecules (Na2, Ag2)with electron pairs,\nand superconductivity can set in.

Instead of phenomenological Doppler-shift\nmethod, we use an approximate analytical solution of Eilenberger equation\ntogether with self-consistent determination of order parameter and a\nvariational treatment of vortex lattice. First, we compare zero-energy density\nof states (ZEDOS) when a magnetic field is applied in the nodal direction\n($\\nu_{node}(0)$) and in the antinodal direction ($\\nu_{anti}(0)$), by taking\naccount of the field-angle dependence of order parameter. As a result, we found\nthat there exists a crossover magnetic field $H^*$ so that $\\nu_{anti}(0) >\n\\nu_{node}(0)$ for $H < H^*$, while $\\nu_{node}(0) > \\nu_{anti}(0)$ for $H >\nH^*$, consistent with our previous analyses. Next, we showed that $H^*$ and the\nshape of FODOS are determined by contribution from the small part of Fermi\nsurface where Fermi velocity is parallel to field-rotational plane. In\nparticular, we found that $H^*$ is lowered and FODOS has broader minima, when a\nsuperconducting gap has point nodes, in contrast to the result of the\nDoppler-shift method.

Hence, as a step towards a quantitative theory of the competition\nbetween antiferromagnetism (AFM) and d-wave superconductivity (SC) in the\ncuprates, we use Cellular Dynamical Mean Field Theory to compute zero\ntemperature properties of the two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model.

The order\nparameter also assumes a dome shape as a function of doping while, by contrast,\nthe gap in the single-particle density of states decreases monotonically with\nincreasing doping.

An abrupt transition to turbulence is the most peculiar\nconsequence. As distinct from viscous hydrodynamics, this transition to\nturbulence is not governed by the velocity-dependent Reynolds number, but by a\nvelocity-independent dimensionless parameter 1/q which depends only on the\ntemperature-dependent mutual friction -- the dissipation which sets in when\nvortices move with respect to the normal excitations of the liquid.
