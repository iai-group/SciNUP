We begin\nin this paper with a derivation of the self-force on a compact object moving in\nthe background spacetime of a supermassive black hole. The EFT approach\nutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the\nsize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background\nspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an\neffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\\it partie finie} to isolate the\nnon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. The latter is\nconstructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retarded\npropagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which only\nlogarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of the\ntheory. As a first important application of this framework we explicitly derive\nthe first order self-force given by Mino, Sasaki, Tanaka, Quinn and Wald.

In addition\nto its nonoscillatory behavior, the Christodoulou memory is interesting because\neven though it originates from 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order multipole\ninteractions, it affects the waveform at leading (Newtonian/quadrupole) order.\nThe memory is also potentially detectable in binary black-hole mergers. While\nthe oscillatory pieces of the gravitational-wave polarizations for\nquasicircular, inspiralling compact binaries have been computed to 3PN order,\nthe memory contribution to the polarizations has only been calculated to\nleading order (the next-to-leading order 0.5PN term has previously been shown\nto vanish).

The IR modified Ho\\v{r}ava gravity seems to be consistent\nwith the current observational data, but in order to test its viability more\nobservational constraints are necessary.

All these gravitational effects can be fully\nexplained in the framework of the vacuum solution of the gravity.

This is the largest sample of GRB\nafterglow spectral energy distributions thus far studied, providing a strong\nhandle on the optical depth distribution of soft X-ray absorption and\ndust-extinction systems in GRB host galaxies. We detect an absorption system\nwithin the GRB host galaxy in 79% of the sample, and an extinction system in\n71% of the sample, and find the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction law to\nprovide an acceptable fit to the host galaxy extinction profile for the\nmajority of cases, consistent with previous findings. The range in the soft\nX-ray absorption to dust-extinction ratio, N_{H,X}/Av, in GRB host galaxies\nspans almost two orders of magnitude, and the typical ratios are significantly\nlarger than those of the Magellanic Clouds or Milky Way.

This framework\nis a special case of the Cosserat theory of elasticity. Rotations of material\npoints of the space continuum are described mathematically by attaching to each\ngeometric point an orthonormal basis which gives a field of orthonormal bases\ncalled the coframe. As the dynamical variables (unknowns) of our theory we\nchoose the coframe and a density.

We elucidate\nunder which conditions a quasiblack hole can form under the presence of matter\nwith nonzero pressure. It is supposed that in the outer region an extremal\nquasihorizon forms, whereas inside, the quasihorizon can be either nonextremal\nor extremal. It is shown that in both cases, nonextremal or extremal inside, a\nwell-defined quasiblack hole always admits a continuous pressure at its own\nquasihorizon. Both the nonextremal and extremal cases inside can be divided\ninto two situations, one in which there is no electromagnetic field, and the\nother in which there is an electromagnetic field. The situation with no\nelectromagnetic field requires a negative matter pressure (tension) on the\nboundary. On the other hand, the situation with an electromagnetic field\ndemands zero matter pressure on the boundary. So in this situation an\nelectrified quasiblack hole can be obtained by the gradual compactification of\na relativistic star with the usual zero pressure boundary condition.

Causal set theory is a LI candidate theory of QG that seeks not to\nquantise gravity as such, but rather to develop a new understanding of the\nuniverse from which both GR and QM could arise separately. The key hypothesis\nis that spacetime is a discrete partial order: a set of events where the\npartial ordering is the physical causal ordering between the events.

In this paper, we present a self-consistent model for the formation and\nevolution of star cluster populations, for which we combine an N-body/SPH\ngalaxy evolution code with semi-analytic models for star cluster evolution. The\nmodel includes star formation, feedback, stellar evolution, and star cluster\ndisruption by two-body relaxation and tidal shocks. We apply the model by\nsimulating a suite of 9 isolated disc galaxies and 24 galaxy mergers. The\nevolutionary histories of individual clusters in these simulations are\ndiscussed to illustrate how the environment of clusters changes in time and\nspace. The resulting variability of the disruption rate with time and space\naffects the properties of star cluster populations. The combined effect of\nclusters escaping their dense formation sites (`cluster migration') and the\npreferential disruption of clusters residing in dense environments (`natural\nselection') implies that the mean disruption rate of the population decreases\nwith cluster age. This affects the slope of the cluster age distribution, which\nbecomes a function of the star formation rate density. The evolutionary\nhistories of clusters in a galaxy merger vary widely and determine which\nclusters survive the merger. This impacts the age distributions and the\nlocations of the surviving clusters at all times during a merger. We conclude\nthat accounting for the interplay between the formation, disruption, and\norbital histories of clusters enables a more sophisticated interpretation of\nobserved properties of cluster populations, thereby extending the role of\ncluster populations as tracers of galaxy evolution. \n\n"}

All the galaxies in our study have spectroscopic data, allowing us to\ndetermine the age and mass of the stellar component. Using the fossil record\ninformation contained in the stellar populations of our local sample, we do not\nfind any evidence for an age segregation at a given stellar mass depending on\nthe size of the galaxies. At a fixed dynamical mass there is only a <9% size\ndifference in the two extreme age quartiles of our sample. Consequently, the\nlocal evidence does not support a scenario whereby the present-day mass-size\nrelation has been progressively established via a bottom-up sequence, where\nolder galaxies occupy the lower part this relation, remaining in place since\ntheir formation. We find a trend in size that is insensitive to the age of the\nstellar populations, at least since z~1.

Unlike\nmethods that were used previously, our technique addresses the question whether\none or more 'testing coefficients' (e.g. in the phase) parameterizing\ndeviations from GR are non-zero, rather than all of them differing from zero at\nthe same time. The framework is well-adapted to a scenario where most sources\nhave low signal-to-noise ratio, and information from multiple sources as seen\nin multiple detectors can readily be combined. In our previous work, we\nconjectured that this framework can detect generic deviations from GR that can\nin principle not be accomodated by our model waveforms, on condition that the\nchange in phase near frequencies where the detectors are the most sensitive is\ncomparable to that induced by simple shifts in the lower-order phase\ncoefficients of more than a few percent ($\\sim 5$ radians at 150 Hz).

The detection and analysis of EMRIs\nwill therefore allow us to study the geometry of massive black holes and\ndetermine whether their nature is as predicted by General Relativity and even\nto test whether General Relativity is the correct theory to describe the\ndynamics of these systems. To achieve this, EMRI modeling in alternative\ntheories of gravity is required to describe the generation of gravitational\nwaves. In this paper, we explore to what extent EMRI observations with LISA or\neLISA/NGO might be able to distinguish between General Relativity and a\nparticular modification of it, known as Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified\nGravity.

Additional information contained\nin the electromagnetic signal, such as the sky location or distance to the\nsource, can help rule out false alarms, and thus lower the necessary threshold\nfor a detection.

As compared with blind, all-sky, all-time GW\nsearches, externally triggered searches for GW counterparts to short GRBs have\nthe advantages of both significantly reduced detection threshold due to known\ntime and sky location and enhanced GW amplitude because of face-on orientation.\nBased on the distribution of signal-to-noise ratios in candidate compact binary\ncoalescence events in the most recent joint LIGO-Virgo data, our analytic\nestimates, and our Monte Carlo simulations, we find an effective sensitive\nvolume for GRB-triggered searches that is about 2 times greater than for an\nall-sky, all-time search.

Here we use cosmological zoom simulations of galaxy formation down to z\n= 2 to show that such strong self-regulation is required in the popular\nspherical Bondi accretion model, but that a plausible alternative model in\nwhich black hole growth is limited by galaxy-scale torques does not require\nself-regulation. Instead, this torque-limited accretion model yields black\nholes and galaxies evolving on average along the observed scaling relations by\nrelying only on a fixed, 5% mass retention rate onto the black hole from the\nradius at which the accretion flow is fed. Feedback from the black hole may\n(and likely does) occur, but does not need to couple to galaxy-scale gas in\norder to regulate black hole growth. We show that this result is insensitive to\nvariations in the initial black hole mass, stellar feedback, or other\nimplementation details. The torque-limited model allows for high accretion\nrates at very early epochs (unlike the Bondi case), which if viable can help\nexplain the rapid early growth of black holes, while by z = 2 it yields\nEddington factors of 1%-10%.

In particular, we argue for a covariant mass bound conjecture: in a\nspacetime free of horizon, the mass inside a surface $A$ cannot exceed $16 \\pi\nG^2 m^2< A $, while the reverse holds in a spacetime with horizons. This is\ngiven a precise definition using the formalism of light-sheets. We show that\n$\\hbar/c$ may be also given a geometrical interpretation, namely $4 \\pi\n\\hbar^2/m^2< A$. We then combine these inequalities and find/review the\nfollowing: (1) Any system must have a size greater than the Planck length, in\nthe sense that there exists a minimal area (2) We comment on the Minimal Length\nScenarios and the fate of Lorentz symmetry near the Planck scale (3) Quanta\nwith transplanckian frequencies are allowed in a large enough boxes (4) There\nexists a mass-dependent maximal acceleration given by $m c^3/\\hbar$ if $m<m_p$\nand by $c^4/G m$ if $m>m_p$ (5) There exists a mass dependent maximal force and\npower (6) There exists a maximal energy density and pressure (7) Physical\nsystems must obey the Holographic Principle (8) Holographic bounds can only be\nsaturated by systems with $m>m_p$; systems lying on the ``Compton line'' $l\n\\sim 1/m$ are fundamental objects without substructures (9) We speculate on a\nnew bound from above for the action. In passing, we note that the maximal\nacceleration is of the order of Milgrom's acceleration $a_0$ for ultra-light\nparticles ($m\\sim H_0)$ that could be associated to the Dark Energy fluid. This\nsuggests designing toy-models in which modified gravity in galaxies is driven\nby the DE field, via the maximal acceleration principle. \n\n"}

We prove that for a star in\ndynamic equilibrium, the necessary and sufficient condition for thermodynamic\nequilibrium (extremum of total entropy S) is constancy of angular velocity\n(\\Omega), redshifted temperature, and redshifted chemical potential. Friedman\npreviously identified positivity of canonical energy, E, as a criterion for\ndynamic stability and argued that all rotating stars are dynamically unstable\nto sufficiently nonaxisymmetric perturbations (the CFS instability), so our\nmain focus is on axisymmetric stability. We show that for a star in dynamic\nequilibrium, mode stability holds with respect to all axisymmetric\nperturbations if E is positive on a certain subspace, V, of axisymmetric\nLagrangian perturbations that, in particular, have no Lagrangian change in\nangular momentum density. Conversely, if E fails to be positive on V, then\nthere exist perturbations that can't become asymptotically stationary at late\ntimes.

For axisymmetric\nperturbations we have E = E_r, so a necessary condition for thermodynamic\nstability with respect to axisymmetric perturbations is positivity of E on all\nperturbations with \\delta J = 0, not merely on the perturbations in V.

Our analysis is based on\nsensitive high resolution data from the THINGS (atomic gas) and HERACLES\n(molecular gas) surveys. To obtain reliable measurements of the velocity\ndispersion, we stack regions several kilo-parsecs in size, after accounting for\nintrinsic velocity shifts due to galactic rotation and large-scale motions.

We fit single Gaussian components to the stacked spectra and\nmeasure median velocity dispersions for HI of 11.9 +/- 3.1 km/s and for H2 of\n12.0 +/- 3.9 km/s.

We extend the computation of the I-Q relation\nto models rotating up to the mass-shedding limit and show that the universality\nof the relations is lost.

The remarkably small\nprojected distance, or impact parameter, between the lens and the source has\nbeen estimated to be 0.8 +/- 0.1 kpc in a recent work. By exploiting the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey database, we establish a likely lensing magnification signal\nin the photometry of the QSO. This is determined to be 2.2 mag brighter (or 8\ntimes more luminous) than the median QSO at comparable redshifts. We describe\nthe total mass distribution of the lens galaxy with a one-component singular\nisothermal sphere model and contrast the values of the observed and\nmodel-predicted magnification factors.

The temperature of the gas in this region is 1.4 keV, which is a factor of\n~4 lower than the surrounding medium and is typical of the virialized plasma of\na galaxy group with a mass of a few 10^13M_sun.

We find very small differences in the late-time bulk\ndynamics of non-magnetized hydrodynamic evolutions between the two spacetimes\ndown to separations of approximately $40GM/c^2$ where $M$ is the total mass of\nthe binary. For smaller separations, the differences due to PN-order become\ncomparable to differences caused by using initial data further from\nequilibrium. For magnetized gas, MHD stresses, which drives the accretion\ndynamics, tends to mask all higher order PN effects even at separations of\n$20GM/c^2$, leading to essentially the same observed electromagnetic\nluminosity. This implies that our calculations of the EM signal may be robust\ndown to small binary separations. Our investigation is the first to demonstrate\nhow the level of PN accuracy affects a circumbinary disk's evolution and\ninforms us of the range in separation within which to trust the PN\napproximation for this kind of study.

This last contribution is going to be characterised by the\nLISA Pathfinder mission, a technology precursor of future space-borne detectors\nlike eLISA. Changing the perspective from displacement to acceleration can\nbenefit the data analysis of LISA Pathfinder and future detectors. The response\nin differential acceleration to gravitational waves is derived for a\nspace-based detector's interferometric link. The acceleration formalism can\nalso be integrated into time delay interferometry by building up the\nunequal-arm Michelson differential acceleration combination. The differential\nacceleration is nominally insensitive to the system free evolution dominating\nthe slow displacement dynamics of low-frequency detectors. Working with\nacceleration also provides an effective way to subtract measured signals acting\nas systematics, including the actuation forces. Because of the strong\nsimilarity with the equations of motion, the optimal subtraction of systematic\nsignals, known within some amplitude and time shift, with the focus on\nmeasuring the noise provides an effective way to solve the problem and\nmarginalise over nuisance parameters. The $\\mathcal{F}$-statistic, in\nwidespread use throughout the gravitation waves community, is included in the\nmethod and suitably generalised to marginalise over linear parameters and noise\nat the same time. The method is applied to LPF simulator data and, thanks to\nits generality, can also be applied to the data reduction and analysis of\nfuture gravitational wave detectors. \n\n"}

How the mechanism producing EM emission is related to any continuous\ngravitational-wave (CW) emission is unknown; if they either interact or are\nlocked in phase then the CW will also experience timing noise. Any disparity\nbetween the signal and the search template used in matched filtering methods\nwill result in a loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), referred to as\n`mismatch'.

In previous papers, the proposal was developed with\nan almost exact de Sitter space-time approximation for the background that led\nto a perfect scale-invariant power spectrum. In the present article, we\nconsider a full quasi-de Sitter expansion and calculate the primordial power\nspectrum for three different choices of the self-induced collapse. The\nconsideration of a quasi-de Sitter background allow us to distinguish\ndepartures from an exact scale-invariant power spectrum that are due to the\ninclusion of the collapse hypothesis. These deviations are also different from\nthe prediction of standard inflationary models with running spectral index.\nComparison with the primordial power spectrum and the CMB temperature\nfluctuation spectrum preferred by the latest observational data is also\ndiscussed. From the analysis performed in this work, it follows that most of\nthe collapse schemes analysed in this paper are viable candidates to explain\npresent observations of the CMB fluctuation spectrum. \n\n"}

We show that, if\nrecent claims of a numerous population of faint AGNs at z=4-6 are upheld, and\nthe high inferred AGN comoving emissivity at these epochs persists to higher,\nz~10, redshifts, then active galaxies may drive the reionization of hydrogen\nand helium with little contribution from normal star-forming galaxies.

Much of this may be caused\nby the requirement that the gravitational sphere of influence of the black hole\nmust be resolved for the black-hole mass to be reliably estimated. We revisit\nthis issue by using a comprehensive galaxy evolution semi-analytic model, which\nself-consistently evolves supermassive black holes from high-redshift seeds via\ngas accretion and mergers, and also includes AGN feedback. Once tuned to\nreproduce the (mean) correlation of black-hole mass with velocity dispersion,\nthe model is unable to also account for the correlation with stellar mass. This\nbehaviour is independent of the model's parameters, thus suggesting an internal\ninconsistency in the data. The predicted distributions, especially at the\nlow-mass end, are also much broader than observed. However, if selection\neffects are included, the model's predictions tend to align with the\nobservations. We also demonstrate that the correlations between the residuals\nof the local scaling relations are more effective than the scaling relations\nthemselves at constraining AGN feedback models. In fact, we find that our\nsemi-analytic model, while in apparent broad agreement with the scaling\nrelations when accounting for selection biases, yields very weak correlations\nbetween their residuals at fixed stellar mass, in stark contrast with\nobservations.

As a consequence, most of the formed PBHs\nare rapidly rotating near the extreme value $a_{*}=1$, where $a_{*}$ is the\nnondimensional Kerr parameter at their formation.

These searches currently use model\nwaveforms that do not include the higher-order mode content of the\ngravitational-wave signal. Higher-order modes are important for many compact\nbinary mergers and their omission reduces the sensitivity to such sources. In\nthis work we explore the sensitivity loss incurred from omitting higher-order\nmodes. We present a new method for searching for compact binary mergers using\nwaveforms that include higher-order mode effects, and evaluate the sensitivity\nincrease that using our new method would allow. We find that, when evaluating\nsensitivity at a constant rate-of-false alarm, and when including the fact that\nsignal-consistency tests can reject some signals that include higher-order mode\ncontent, we observe a sensitivity increase of up to a factor of 2 in volume for\nhigh mass ratio, high total-mass systems.

We propose\nthat this relation could arise from collisional interactions between baryons\nand dark matter (DM) particles, without the need for modification of gravity or\nad hoc feedback processes. We assume that these interactions satisfy the\nfollowing three conditions: (i) the relaxation time of DM particles is\ncomparable to the dynamical time in disk galaxies; (ii) DM exchanges energy\nwith baryons due to elastic collisions; (iii) the product between the baryon-DM\ncross section and the typical energy exchanged in a collision is inversely\nproportional to the DM number density.

The collapse violently snaps the magnetic-field lines\nanchored on the stellar surface, thus producing an electromagnetic pulse that\nwill propagate outwards and accelerate electrons producing a massive radio\nburst, i.e. a \"blitzar\". We present a systematic study of the gravitational\ncollapse of rotating and magnetised neutron stars with special attention to\nfar-field evolution at late times after the collapse. By considering a series\nof neutron stars with rotation ranging from zero to millisecond periods and\ndifferent magnetic-field strengths, we show that the blitzar emission is very\nrobust and always characterised by a series sub-millisecond pulses decaying\nexponentially in amplitude.

This quantity, the effective spin\n$\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is conserved up to at least the second post-Newtonian\norder.

In\nthese environments, energetic CRs are virtually collisionless and interact via\ncollective phenomena mediated by kinetic-scale plasma waves and large-scale\nmagnetic fields. The enormous separation of kinetic and global astrophysical\nscales requires a hydrodynamic description. Here, we develop a new macroscopic\ntheory for CR transport in the self-confinement picture, which includes CR\ndiffusion and streaming. The interaction between CRs and electromagnetic fields\nof Alfv\\'enic turbulence provides the main source of CR scattering, and causes\nCRs to stream along the magnetic field with the Alfv\\'en velocity if resonant\nwaves are sufficiently energetic. However, numerical simulations struggle to\ncapture this effect with current transport formalisms and adopt regularization\nschemes to ensure numerical stability.

Does such the\ncorrespondence rely strongly on the feature of the gravity vanishing at the\ninfinity? In order to resolve this question, it should be considered for the\nfirst to extend the Hawking radiation to a case with a dynamical boundary\ncondition like an expanding universe. Therefore the Hawking radiation in an\nexpanding universe is discussed in this paper.

This class includes the\nHeterotic M-theory brane-world of Refs. \\cite{ovrut,ekpy} and the\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) model as a limiting case. In general, there are two moduli\nfields $y_{\\pm}$, corresponding to the \"positions\" of two branes (which live at\nthe fixed points of an orbifold compactification). Classically, the moduli are\nmassless, due to a scaling symmetry of the action. However, in the absence of\nsupersymmetry, they develop an effective potential at one loop.

Such terms break the scaling symmetry\nand hence they may act as stabilizers for the moduli. When the branes are very\nclose to each other, the effective potential induced by massless bulk fields\nbehaves like $V\\sim d^{-4}$, where $d$ is the separation between branes.

This allows us, through the junction conditions, to deduce\nthe effective equations of motion for the gravity on the brane. It is shown\nthat the gravity on the brane world is described by a quasi-scalar-tensor\ntheory with a specific coupling function omega(Psi) = 3 Psi / 2(1-Psi) on the\npositive tension brane and omega(Phi) = -3 Phi / 2(1+Phi) on the negative\ntension brane, where Psi and Phi are non-linear realizations of the radion on\nthe positive and negative tension branes, respectively.

Specifically, in a universe with a minimal length (for\nexample, due to quantum gravity), no experiment can exclude the possibility\nthat Hilbert space is discrete. We give some simple examples involving qubits\nand the Schrodinger wavefunction, and discuss implications for quantum\ninformation and quantum gravity. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0510021", "contents": "Title: Entanglement entropy, black holes and holography Abstract: We observe that the entanglement entropy resulting from tracing over a\nsubregion of an initially pure state can grow faster than the surface area of\nthe subregion (indeed, proportional to the volume), in contrast to examples\nstudied previously. The pure states with this property have long-range\ncorrelations between interior and exterior modes and are constructed by\npurification of the desired density matrix. We show that imposing a\nno-gravitational collapse condition on the pure state is sufficient to exclude\nfaster than area law entropy scaling. This observation leads to an\ninterpretation of holography as an upper bound on the realizable entropy\n(entanglement or von Neumann) of a region, rather than on the dimension of its\nHilbert space. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0510246", "contents": "Title: The Kerr theorem and multiparticle Kerr-Schild solutions Abstract: We discuss and prove an extended version of the Kerr theorem which allows one\nto construct exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell field equations from a\nholomorphic generating function $F$ of twistor variables. The exact\nmultiparticle Kerr-Schild solutions are obtained from generating function of\nthe form $F=\\prod_i^k F_i, $ where $F_i$ are partial generating functions for\nthe spinning particles $ i=1...k$. Solutions have an unusual multi-sheeted\nstructure. Twistorial structures of the i-th and j-th particles do not feel\neach other, forming a type of its internal space. Gravitational and\nelectromagnetic interaction of the particles occurs via the light-like singular\ntwistor lines. As a result, each particle turns out to be `dressed' by singular\npp-strings connecting it to other particles. We argue that this solution may\nhave a relation to quantum theory and to quantum gravity. \n\n"}

We show that such theory is endowed with a quite\nrich cosmological structure: it may naturally lead to an effective cosmological\nconstant, quintessence or phantom cosmic acceleration, with a possible\ntransition from deceleration to acceleration. It is demonstrated in the paper\nthat this theory is perfectly viable, since it is compliant with Solar System\nconstraints. Specific properties of $f(G)$ gravity in a de Sitter universe,\nsuch as dS and SdS solutions, their entropy and its explicit one-loop\nquantization are studied. The issue of a possible solution of the hierarchy\nproblem in modified gravities is addressed too. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0605122", "contents": "Title: Mimicking Lambda with a spin-two ghost condensate Abstract: We propose a simple higher-derivative braneworld gravity model which contains\na stable accelerating branch, in the absence of cosmological constant or\npotential, that can be used to describe the late time cosmic acceleration. This\nmodel has similar qualitative features to that of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati, such\nas the recovery of four-dimensional gravity at subhorizon scales, but unlike\nthat case, the graviton zero mode is massless and there are no linearized\ninstabilities. The acceleration rather is driven by bulk gravity in the form of\na spin-two ghost condensate. We show that this model can be consistent with\ncosmological bounds and tests of gravity. \n\n"}

We show that the dynamics of trans-Planckian modes can\nbe cast in the form of an effective modified dispersion relation and that high\nenergy corrections in the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background\nradiation produced during inflation remain very small if the initial state is\nthe Bunch-Davies vacuum. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0608175", "contents": "Title: Spacetime topology change and black hole information Abstract: Topology change -- the creation of a disconnected baby universe -- due to\nblack hole collapse may resolve the information loss paradox. Evolution from an\nearly time Cauchy surface to a final surface which includes a slice of the\ndisconnected region can be unitary and consistent with conventional quantum\nmechanics. We discuss the issue of cluster decomposition, showing that any\nviolations thereof are likely to be unobservably small. Topology change is\nsimilar to the black hole remnant scenario and only requires assumptions about\nthe behavior of quantum gravity in planckian regimes. It does not require\nnon-locality or any modification of low-energy physics. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0610206", "contents": "Title: S-Dual Gravity in the Axial Gauge Abstract: We investigate an action that includes simultaneously original and dual\ngravitational fields (in the first order formalism), where the dual fields are\ncompletely determined in terms of the original fields through axial gauge\nconditions and partial (non-covariant) duality constraints. We introduce two\nkinds of matter, one that couples to the original metric, and dual matter that\ncouples to the dual metric. The linear response of both metrics to the\ncorresponding stress energy tensors coincides with Einstein's equations. In the\npresence of nonvanishing standard and dual cosmological constants a stable\nsolution with a time independent dual scale factor exists that could possibly\nsolve the cosmological constant problem, provided our world is identified with\nthe dual sector of the model. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0611048", "contents": "Title: Notes on the Area Theorem Abstract: Hawking's area theorem can be understood from a quasi-stationary process in\nwhich a black hole accretes $positive$ energy matter, ``independent of the\ndetails of the gravity action''. I use this process to study the dynamics of\nthe ``inner'' as well as the outer horizons for various black holes which\ninclude the recently discovered exotic black holes and three-dimensional black\nholes in higher derivative gravities as well as the usual BTZ black hole and\nthe Kerr black hole in four dimensions. I find that the area for the inner\nhorizon ``can decrease'', rather than increase, with the quasi-stationary\nprocess. However, I find that the area for the outer horizon ``never decrease''\nsuch as the usual area theorem still works in our examples, though this is\nquite non-trivial in general. There exist the instability of the inner horizons\nand the connected effects of ``mass inflation'' but, according to more detailed\nanalysis, it seems that the instability is not important in my analysis. I also\nfind a ``generalized'' area theorem by combining those of the outer and inner\nhorizons. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/9301058", "contents": "Title: How Fast Does Information Leak out from a Black Hole? Abstract: Hawking's radiance, even as computed without account of backreaction, departs\nfrom blackbody form due to the mode dependence of the barrier penetration\nfactor. Thus the radiation is not the maximal entropy radiation for given\nenergy. By comparing estimates of the actual entropy emission rate with the\nmaximal entropy rate for the given power, and using standard ideas from\ncommunication theory, we set an upper bound on the permitted information\noutflow rate. This is several times the rates of black hole entropy decrease or\nradiation entropy production. Thus, if subtle quantum effects not heretofore\naccounted for code information in the radiance, the information that was\nthought to be irreparably lost down the black hole may gradually leak back out\nfrom the black hole environs over the full duration of the hole's evaporation. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/9309075", "contents": "Title: Pair Creation of Dilaton Black Holes Abstract: We consider dilaton gravity theories in four spacetime dimensions\nparametrised by a constant $a$, which controls the dilaton coupling, and\nconstruct new exact solutions. We first generalise the C-metric of\nEinstein-Maxwell theory ($a=0$) to solutions corresponding to oppositely\ncharged dilaton black holes undergoing uniform acceleration for general $a$. We\nnext develop a solution generating technique which allows us to ``embed\" the\ndilaton C-metrics in magnetic dilaton Melvin backgrounds, thus generalising the\nErnst metric of Einstein-Maxwell theory. By adjusting the parameters\nappropriately, it is possible to eliminate the nodal singularities of the\ndilaton C-metrics. For $a<1$ (but not for $a\\ge 1$), it is possible to further\nrestrict the parameters so that the dilaton Ernst solutions have a smooth\neuclidean section with topology $S^2\\times S^2-{\\rm\\{pt\\}}$, corresponding to\ninstantons describing the pair production of dilaton black holes in a magnetic\nfield. A different restriction on the parameters leads to smooth instantons for\nall values of $a$ with topology $S^2\\times \\R^2$. \n\n"}

Quantum corrections to the black hole entropy are computed,\nand the fine-grained entropy of the Hawking radiation is studied.

{"id": "hep-th/9501040", "contents": "Title: Correlations, Decoherence, Dissipation, and Noise in Quantum Field\n  Theory Abstract: The statistical mechanical properties of interacting quantum fields in terms\nof the dynamics of the correlation functions are investigated. We show how the\nDyson - Schwinger equations may be derived from a formal action functional, the\nn-particle irreducible ($nPI, n \\to \\infty$) or the `master' effective action.\nIt is related to the decoherence functional between histories defined in terms\nof correlations. Upon truncation of the Dyson - Schwinger hierarchy at a\ncertain order, the master effective action becomes complex, its imaginary part\narising from the higher order correlation functions, the fluctuations of which\nwe define as the correlation noises of that order. Decoherence of correlation\nhistories via these noises gives rise to classical stochastic histories %driven\nby the flucutations of these higher correlation functions. Ordinary quantum\nfield theory corresponds to taking the lowest order functions, usually the mean\nfield and the 2-point functions. As such, our reasoning shows that it is an\neffective theory which can be intrinsically dissipative. The relation of loop\nexpansion and correlation order as well as the introduction of an arrow of time\nfrom the choice of boundary conditions are expounded with regard to the origin\nof dissipation in quantum fields. Relation with critical phenomena, quantum\ntransport, molecular hydrodynamics and potential applications to quantum\ngravity, early universe processes and black hole physics are mentioned. \n\n"}

The new theories have the advantage that they\nare limits of corresponding $(p,q)$ adS supergravity theories and, for not too\nlarge a value of $N=p+q$, that they have a natural formulation in terms of\noff-shell superfields, in which context the distinction between theories having\nthe same value of $N$ but different $(p,q)$ arises because of inequivalent\nconformal compensator superfields. We also show that, unlike previously\nconstructed N-extended Poincar\\'e supergravity theories, the new (2,0) theory\nadmits conical spacetimes with Killing spinors. Many of our results on (2,0)\nPoincar\\'e supergravity continue to apply in the presence of coupling to N=2\nsupersymmetric sigma-model matter. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/9602169", "contents": "Title: Nonperturbative methods for calculating the heat kernel Abstract: We study the low-energy approximation for calculation of the heat kernel\nwhich is determined by the strong slowly varying background fields in strongly\ncurved quasi-homogeneous manifolds. A new covariant algebraic approach, based\non taking into account a finite number of low-order covariant derivatives of\nthe background fields and neglecting all covariant derivatives of higher\norders, is proposed. It is shown that a set of covariant differential operators\ntogether with the background fields and their low-order derivatives generates a\nfinite dimensional Lie algebra. This algebraic structure can be used to present\nthe heat semigroup operator in the form of an average over the corresponding\nLie group. Closed covariant formulas for the heat kernel diagonal are obtained.\nThese formulas serve, in particular, as the generating functions for the whole\nsequence of the Hadamard-\\-Minakshisundaram-\\-De~Witt-\\-Seeley coefficients in\nall symmetric spaces. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/9612248", "contents": "Title: Wavy Strings: Black or Bright? Abstract: Recent developments in string theory have brought forth a considerable\ninterest in time-dependent hair on extended objects. This novel new hair is\ntypically characterized by a wave profile along the horizon and angular\nmomentum quantum numbers $l,m$ in the transverse space. In this work, we\npresent an extensive treatment of such oscillating black objects, focusing on\ntheir geometric properties. We first give a theorem of purely geometric nature,\nstating that such wavy hair cannot be detected by any scalar invariant built\nout of the curvature and/or matter fields. However, we show that the tidal\nforces detected by an infalling observer diverge at the `horizon' of a black\nstring superposed with a vibration in any mode with $l \\ge 1$. The same\nargument applied to longitudinal ($l=0$) waves detects only finite tidal\nforces. We also provide an example with a manifestly smooth metric, proving\nthat at least a certain class of these longitudinal waves have regular\nhorizons. \n\n"}

The existence of solutions and the number of\nindependent harmonic functions is defined by the matrix of scalar products of\nvectors $U^s$, governing the sigma-model target space metric.

We also investigate the mean squared fields and the energy\ndensity in the vacuum region between two parallel half-spaces. Of particular\ninterest is the sign of the energy density.
