Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

Consequently, the model has no free parameters other\nthan the initial conditions at the onset of the explosion, and therefore it has\nconsiderable predictive power.

The resulting ultra\nmetal-poor abundance distribution provided the initial conditions for the\nsecond stars of a wide range of initial masses reaching down to intermediate\nand low masses. The importance of these second stars for understanding the\norigin of the elements in the early universe are manifold. While the massive\nfirst stars have long vanished the second stars are still around and currently\nobserved. They are the carriers of the information about the first stars, but\nthey are also capable of nuclear production themselves. For example, in order\nto use ultra or extremely metal-poor stars as a probe for the r-process in the\nearly universe a reliable model of the s-process in the second stars is needed.\nEventually, the second stars may provide us with important clues on questions\nranging from structure formation to how the stars actually make the elements,\nnot only in the early but also in the present universe. In particular the\nC-rich extremely metal-poor stars, most of which show the s-process signature,\nare thought to be associated with chemical yields from the evolved giant phase\nof intermediate mass stars. Models of such AGB stars at extremely low\nmetallicity now exist, and comparison with observation show important\ndiscrepancies, for example with regard to the synthesis of nitrogen. This may\nhint at burning and mixing aspects of extremely metal-poor evolved stars that\nare not yet included in the standard picture of evolution, as for example the\nhydrogen-ingestion flash. The second stars of intermediate mass may have also\nplayed an important role in the formation of heavy elements that form through\nslow neutron capture reaction chains (s-process). Comparison of models with\nobservations reveal which aspects of the physics input and assumptions need to\nbe improved. The s-process is a particularly useful diagnostic tool for probing\nthe physical processes that are responsible for the creation of elements in\nstars, like for example rotation. As new observational techniques and\nstrategies continue to penetrate the field, for example the multi-object\nspectroscopy, or the future spectroscopic surveys, the extremely metal-poor\nstars will play an increasingly important role to address some of the most\nfundamental and challenging, current questions of astronomy. \n\n"}

This model differs\nfrom traditional models of supernova debris interacting with external CSM in\nthat here the shell is optically thick and the escape of radiation is delayed.\nWe show that any model attempting to account for SN2006gy's huge luminosity\nwith radiation emitted by ongoing CSM interaction fails for the following basic\nreason: the CSM density required to achieve the observed luminosity makes the\nsame circumstellar envelope opaque, forcing a thermal diffusion solution.

The EFT approach\nutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the\nsize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background\nspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an\neffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\\it partie finie} to isolate the\nnon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part.

The SMBHs in\nall three scenarios follow the same black hole fundamental plane (BHFP) and\ncorrelation with bulge binding energy seen in simulations of major mergers, and\nobserved locally. Furthermore, provided that the total gas supply is\nsignificantly larger than the mass of the SMBH, its limiting mass is not\ninfluenced by the amount of gas available or the efficiency of black hole\ngrowth. This supports the assertion that SMBHs accrete until they reach a\ncritical mass at which feedback is sufficient to unbind the gas locally,\nterminating the inflow and stalling further growth. At the same time, while\nminor and major mergers follow the same projected correlations (e.g., the\n$M_{BH}-\\sigma$ and Magorrian relations), SMBHs grown via disk instabilities do\nnot, owing to structural differences between the host bulges. This finding is\nsupported by recent observations of SMBHs in pseudobulges and bulges in barred\nsystems, as compared to those hosted by classical bulges. Taken together, this\nprovides support for the BHFP and binding energy correlations as being more\n\"fundamental\" than other proposed correlations in that they reflect the\nphysical mechanism driving the co-evolution of SMBHs and spheroids. \n\n"}

Simulated\ncounts of cosmological sources are produced by means of a generalized\nnumber-distance expression that can be specialized to produce either the counts\nof the Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) cosmology, which has SH by construction, or\nother types of counts, which do, or do not, have OH by construction.\nExpressions for observational volumes and differential densities are derived\nwith the various cosmological distance definitions in the EdS model. Simulated\ncounts that have OH by construction do not always exhibit SH features. The\nreverse situation is also true. Besides, simulated counts with no OH features\nat low redshift start showing OH characteristics at high redshift. The comoving\ndistance seems to be the only distance definition where both SH and OH appear\nsimultaneously. The results show that observations indicating possible lack of\nOH do not necessarily falsify the standard Friedmannian cosmology, meaning that\nthis cosmology will not necessarily always produce observable homogeneous\ndensities. The general conclusion is that the use of different cosmological\ndistances in the characterization of the galaxy distribution lead to\nsignificant ambiguities in reaching conclusions about the behavior of the\nlarge-scale galaxy distribution in the Universe. \n\n"}

The same modeling conclusively\ndemonstrates that C and Ne are highly enhanced, with abundance ratios of\nC/O~15-45 and Ne/O~3.3-5.0 (90% confidence ranges, relative to the solar\nratios), while N and Fe are depleted, N/O~0.0-1.0 and Fe/O~0.1-0.4.

The metallicity gradients are measured out to one effective radius by\ncomparing nearly all of the Lick absorption-line indices to recent models of\nsingle stellar populations. The relation shows very different behaviour at low\nand high masses, with a sharp transition being seen at a mass of ~ 3.5 x 10^10\nM_sun (velocity dispersion of ~140 km/s, M_B ~ -19). Low-mass galaxies form a\ntight relation with mass, such that metallicity gradients become shallower with\ndecreasing mass and positive at the very low-mass end. Above the mass\ntransition point several massive galaxies have steeper gradients, but a clear\ndownturn is visible marked by a broad scatter.

The period distribution of the SDSS CVs differs\ndramatically from that of all the previously known CVs, in particular it\ncontains a significant accumulation of systems in the orbital period range\n80--86 min. We identify this feature as the elusive \"period minimum spike\"\npredicted by CV population models, which resolves a long-standing discrepancy\nbetween compact binary evolution theory and observations.

Indeed, their inclusion is crucial since the sources in M31\nmicrolensing events are mainly giant stars. Light curves with detectable\nplanetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the\ncorresponding Paczy\\'{n}ski shapes. We find that the time scale of planetary\ndeviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source size\nincreases. This means that only few exposures per day, depending also on the\nrequired accuracy, may be sufficient to reveal in the light curve a planetary\ncompanion. Although the mean planet mass for the selected events is about $2\nM_{\\rm {Jupiter}}$, even small mass planets ($M_{\\rm P} < 20 M_{\\oplus}$) can\ncause significant deviations, at least in the observations with large\ntelescopes.

The model galaxy is employed from an ultra-high-resolution\nchemodynamic simulation of a primordial galaxy by Mori & Umemura (2006),which\nwell reproduces the observed properties of LAEs and LBGs. The total mass of\nmodel galaxy is 10^{11}M_sun. We solve not only photo-ionization but also\ncollisional ionization by shocks. In addition, according to the chemical\nenrichment, we incorporate the effect of dust extinction, taking the size\ndistributions of dust into account. As a result, we find that dust extinction\nreduces the escape fractions by a factor 1.5-8.5 in the LAE phase and by a\nfactor 2.5-11 in the LBG phase, while the collisional ionization by shocks\nincreases the escape fractions by a factor ~ 2.

These results\nare well concordant with the recent estimations derived from the flux ratio at\n1500 angstrom to 900 angstrom of LAEs and LBGs.

We discuss to what extent the current sample of Swift bursts with OA\nspectroscopy is a biased subsample of all Swift detected GRBs.

We derive the redshift distribution for this\nsample and conclude that less than 19% of Swift bursts are at z>7.

The\nbursts in group i) have significantly less excess X-ray absorption than bursts\nin the other two groups.

To visualize the flow pattern\nin the low photosphere, we used a bisector of the wing of the absorption lines.\nDue to the small heliocentric angle (3 < Theta < 9) of our data sets, the\nhorizontal component of the Evershed flow (EF) does not contribute\nsignificantly to the line shift. We found that in the quiet Sun (QS), the area\nshowing up-flows is always larger than the one exhibiting down-flows. In the\npenumbra, up-flows dominate only at low velocities |v_dop| < 0.4 km/s while at\nlarger velocities |v_dop| > 0.6 km/s down-flows prevail. Additionally, the\nmaximal up-flow velocity in penumbrae is smaller, while the maximal down-flow\nvelocity is larger with respect to the QS velocities.

A common approach to the eta problem is to impose a\nshift symmetry on the inflaton field.

In this paper, we show that the\nbreaking of the shift symmetry by Planck-scale corrections can be\nsystematically suppressed if the inflaton field interacts with a conformal\nsector.

It thus offers the opportunity to check our\nunderstanding of the physics and the evolution of solar-type stars in a cluster\nenvironment. We present the first spectroscopic study at high resolution,\nR~50,000, of the potentially best solar twin, M67-1194, identified among\nsolar-like stars in M67. Based on a pre-selection of solar-twin candidates\nperformed at medium resolution by Pasquini et al. (2008), we explore the\nchemical-abundance similarities and differences between M67-1194 and the Sun,\nusing VLT/FLAMES-UVES. Working with a solar twin in the framework of a\ndifferential analysis, we minimize systematic model errors in the abundance\nanalysis compared to previous studies which utilized more evolved stars to\ndetermine the metallicity of M67. We find M67-1194 to have stellar parameters\nindistinguishable from the solar values, with the exception of the overall\nmetallicity which is slightly super-solar ([Fe/H]=0.023 +/- 0.015). An age\ndetermination based on evolutionary tracks yields 4.2 +/- 1.6Gyr. Most\nsurprisingly, we find the chemical abundance pattern to closely resemble the\nsolar one, in contrast to most known solar twins in the solar neighbourhood. We\nconfirm the solar-twin nature of M67-1194, the first solar twin known to belong\nto a stellar association. This fact allows us to put some constraints on the\nphysical reasons for the seemingly systematic departure of M67-1194 and the Sun\nfrom most known solar twins regarding chemical composition. We find that\nradiative dust cleansing by nearby luminous stars may be the explanation for\nthe peculiar composition of both the Sun and M67-1194, but alternative\nexplanations are also possible. The chemical similarity between the Sun and\nM67-1194 also suggests that the Sun once formed in a cluster like M67. \n\n"}

Detection of lithium in the metal-poor bulge dwarf\n  MOA-2010-BLG-285S Abstract: Context: In order to study the evolution of Li in the Galaxy it is necessary\nto observe dwarf or subgiant stars. Abridged Although Li has been extensively\nstudied in the Galactic disk and halo, to date there is only one uncertain\ndetection of Li in an unevolved bulge star. AIMS: Our aim with this study is to\nprovide the first clear detection of Li in the Galactic bulge, based on an\nanalysis of a dwarf star that has largely retained its initial Li abundance.\nMETHODS: We have performed a detailed elemental abundance analysis of the bulge\ndwarf star MOA-2010-BLG-285S using a high-resolution, and high signal-to-noise\nspectrum obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the VLT when the object was\noptically magnified during a gravitational microlensing event (visual\nmagnification A~550 during observation). The lithium abundance was determined\nthrough synthetic line profile fitting of the 7Li resonance doublet line at\n670.8 nm. The results have been corrected for departures from LTE. Results:\nMOA-2010-BLG-285S is, at [Fe/H]=-1.23, the most metal-poor dwarf star detected\nso far in the Galactic bulge. Its old age (12.5 Gyr) and enhanced [alpha/Fe]\nratios agree well with stars in the thick disk at similar metallicity. This\nstar represents the first unambiguous detection of Li in a metal-poor dwarf\nstar in the Galactic bulge. We find an NLTE corrected Li abundance of log\ne(Li)=2.16, which is consistent with values derived for Galactic disk and halo\ndwarf stars at similar metallicities and temperatures. Conclusion: Our results\nshow that there are no signs of Li enrichment or production in the Galactic\nbulge during its earliest phases. Observations of Li in other galaxies (omega\nCen) and other components of the Galaxy suggest further that the Spite plateau\nis universal. \n\n"}

I begin with a brief overview of the\n\"standard model\" of CV evolution and explain why the key observables this model\nis designed to explain - the period gap and the period minimum -- are\nintimately connected to the properties of the secondary stars in these systems.\nCV donors are expected to be slightly inflated relative to isolated, equal-mass\nmain-sequence (MS) stars, and this \"donor bloating\" has now been confirmed\nobservationally. The empirical donor mass-radius relationship also shows a\ndiscontinuity at M_2 = 0.2 M_sun which neatly separates long- and short-period\nCVs. This is strong confirmation of the basic disrupted magnetic braking\nscenario for CV evolution. The empirical M_2-R_2 relation can be combined with\nstellar models to construct a complete, semi-empirical donor sequence for CVs.\nThis sequence provides all physical and photometric properties of \"normal\" CV\nsecondaries along the standard CV evolution track. The observed donor\nproperties can also be used to reconstruct the complete evolution track\nfollowed by CVs, i.e. the mass-transfer rate and angular-momentum-loss rate as\na function of orbital period. Such a reconstruction suggests that angular\nmomentum loss rates below the period gap are too high to be driven solely by\ngravitational radiation. \n\n"}

Here\nwe take the truncated disc/hot inner flow picture which can describe the\nspectral changes, and show that propagating mass accretion rate fluctuations in\nthe hot flow can match the broad band power spectral properties seen in black\nhole binaries, i.e. give approximately band limited noise between a low and\nhigh frequency break. The low frequency break marks the viscous timescale at\nthe outer edge of the hot inner flow, which is the inner edge of the truncated\ndisc. The model also predicts the Lense-Thirring precession timescale of the\nhot flow, as this is set by the surface density of the flow which is self\nconsistently calculated from the propagating fluctuations. We show that this\nnaturally gives the observed relation between the low frequency break and QPO\nfrequency as the outer radius of the flow moves inwards, and that this model\npredicts many of the observed QPO properties such as correlation of coherence\nwith frequency, and of the recently discovered correlation of frequency with\nflux on short timescales. We fit this total model of the variability to a\nsequence of 5 observed power spectra from the bright black hole binary XTE\nJ1550-564 as the source transitioned from a low/hard to very high state. This\nis the first time that a power spectrum from a black hole binary has been fit\nwith a physical model for the variability. The data are well fit if the inner\nradius of the flow remains constant, while the outer radius sweeps inwards from\n~60-12 Rg.

We solve the\none-dimensional steady-state accretion problem between the PNS surface and the\naccretion shock. We quantify the deep connection between the solution space of\nsteady-state accretion flows with bounding shocks and the neutrino mechanism.\nWe show that there is a maximum, critical sound speed above which it is\nimpossible to maintain accretion with a standoff shock, because the shock jump\nconditions cannot be satisfied. The physics of this critical sound speed is\ngeneral and does not depend on a specific heating mechanism. For the simple\nmodel of pressure-less free-fall onto a shock bounding an isothermal accretion\nflow with sound speed c_T, we show that if c_T^2/v_escape^2 > 3/16 explosion\nresults. We generalize this result to the more complete supernova problem,\nshowing explicitly that the same physics determines L_crit.

HD 46223,\n  HD 46150 and HD 46966 Abstract: The detection of pulsational frequencies in stellar photometry is required as\ninput for asteroseismological modelling. The second short run (SRa02) of the\nCoRoT mission has provided photometric data of unprecedented quality and\ntime-coverage for a number of O-type stars. We analyse the CoRoT data\ncorresponding to three hot O-type stars, describing the properties of their\nlight curves and we search for pulsational frequencies, which we then compare\nto theoretical model predictions. We determine the amplitude spectrum of the\ndata, using the Lomb-Scargle and a multifrequency HMM-like technique.\nFrequencies are extracted by prewhitening, and their significance is evaluated\nunder the assumption that the light curve is dominated by red noise. We search\nfor harmonics, linear combinations and regular spacings among these\nfrequencies. We use simulations with the same time sampling as the data as a\npowerful tool to judge the significance of our results. From the theoretical\npoint of view, we use the MAD non-adiabatic pulsation code to determine the\nexpected frequencies of excited modes. A substantial number of frequencies is\nlisted, but none can be convincingly identified as being connected to\npulsations. The amplitude spectrum is dominated by red noise. Theoretical\nmodelling shows that all three O-type stars can have excited modes but the\nrelation between the theoretical frequencies and the observed spectrum is not\nobvious. The dominant red noise component in the hot O-type stars studied here\nclearly points to a different origin than the pulsations seen in cooler O\nstars. The physical cause of this red noise is unclear, but we speculate on the\npossibility of sub-surface convection, granulation, or stellar wind\ninhomogeneities being responsible. \n\n"}

The very broad wings of the Ca II triplet and the asymmetric [Ca II]\nemission lines are due to strong Thomson scattering in the expanding ejecta.\nPost-maximum, the hydrogen and Ca II lines developed double-peaked emission\nprofiles that we attribute to a bipolar outflow.

Abstract: The data of the Bullet Cluster 1E0657-558 released on November 15, 2006\nreveal that the strong and weak gravitational lensing convergence $\\kappa$-map\nhas an $8\\sigma$ offset from the $\\Sigma$-map. The observed $\\Sigma$-map is a\ndirect measurement of the surface mass density of the Intracluster medium(ICM)\ngas. It accounts for 83% of the averaged mass-fraction of the system. This\nsuggests a modified gravity theory at large distances different from Newton's\ninverse-square gravitational law. In this paper, as a cluster scale\ngeneralization of Grumiller's modified gravity model (D. Grumiller, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 105, 211303 (2010)), we present a gravity model with a generalized linear\nRindler potential in Randers-Finslerian spacetime without invoking any dark\nmatter. The galactic limit of the model is qualitatively consistent with the\nMOND and Grumiller's. It yields approximately the flatness of the rotational\nvelocity profile at the radial distance of several kpcs and gives the velocity\nscales for spiral galaxies at which the curves become flattened. Plots of\nconvergence $\\kappa$ for a galaxy cluster show that the peak of the\ngravitational potential has chances to lie on the outskirts of the baryonic\nmass center. Assuming an isotropic and isothermal ICM gas profile with\ntemperature $T=14.8$ keV (which is the center value given by observations), we\nobtain a good match between the dynamical mass $M_\\textmd{T}$ of the main\ncluster given by collisionless Boltzmann equation and that given by the King\n$\\beta$-model.

This latter\ntrend is probably driven by the well-established correlation between stretch\nand stellar mass. We find no trends between UV spectral features and optical\ncolour. Mean spectra constructed according to whether the SN has a positive or\nnegative Hubble residual show very little difference at NUV wavelengths,\nindicating that the NUV evolution and variation we identify do not directly\ncorrelate with Hubble residuals.

We construct the evolutionary tracks of growing\nplanets at planet traps in evolving protoplanetary disks and show that they\nprovide a good physical understanding of how these observational properties\narise. The fundamental feature of our model is that inhomogeneities in\nprotoplanetary disks give rise to multiple (up to 3) trapping sites for rapid\n(type I) planetary migration of planetary cores. The viscous evolution of disks\nresults in the slow radial movement of the traps and their cores from large to\nsmall orbital periods.

Planet growth and radial movement\nare ultimately stalled by the dispersal of gas disks via photoevaporation.

It is known that the\nfractional rms amplitude increases with energy at lower energies. At higher\nenergies, the amplitude is usually believed to saturate, although this is not\nestablished. We combine tens of lower kHz QPOs from a neutron star LMXB 4U\n1728-34 in order to improve the signal-to-noise-ratio.

A nearly linear jet was observed which varied\nlittle during a rotation cycle in both R and CN images acquired during the 1999\nand 2010 apparitions. We measured the projected direction of this jet\nthroughout the two apparitions and, under the assumption that the source region\nof the jet was near the comet's pole, determined a rotational pole direction of\nRA/Dec = 151deg/+59deg from CN measurements and RA/Dec = 173deg/+57deg from\ndust measurements (we estimate a circular uncertainty of 3deg for CN and 4deg\nfor dust). Different combinations of effects likely bias both gas and dust\nsolutions and we elected to average these solutions for a final pole of RA/Dec\n= 162 +/- 11deg/+58 +/- 1deg. Photoelectric photometry was acquired in 1983,\n1988, 1999/2000, and 2010/2011. The activity exhibited a steep turn-on ~3\nmonths prior to perihelion (the exact timing of which varies) and a relatively\nsmooth decline after perihelion. The activity during the 1999 and 2010\napparitions was similar; limited data in 1983 and 1988 were systematically\nhigher and the difference cannot be explained entirely by the smaller\nperihelion distance. We measured a \"typical\" composition, in agreement with\nprevious investigators.

Both these fields map out the\nlarge scale distribution of neutral hydrogen and maybe treated as tracers of\nthe underlying dark matter field. We first present the general formalism for\nthe auto and cross bispectrum of two arbitrary three dimensional biased tracers\nand then apply it to the specific case. We have modeled the 3D Ly-alpha\ntransmitted flux field as a continuous tracer sampled along 1D skewers which\ncorresponds to quasars sight lines.

We use a Fisher matrix analysis to present the\nfirst prediction for bounds on f_{NL} and the other bias parameters using the\nthree dimensional 21-cm bispectrum and other cross bispectra. The bounds on\nf_{NL} depend on the survey volume, and the various observational noises.

The resulting ejecta are\nchemically stratified, have the same mass and roughly the same asymptotic\nkinetic energy, but exhibit a range in 56Ni mass. We investigate the\ncontemporaneous photometric and spectroscopic properties of a sequence of\ndelayed-detonation models, characterized by 56Ni masses between 0.18 and 0.81\nMsun.

Despite the 1D treatment, our approach delivers an excellent agreement\nto observations. We recover the range of SN Ia luminosities, colours, and\nspectral characteristics from the near-UV to 1 micron, for standard as well as\nlow-luminosity 91bg-like SNe Ia. Our models predict an increase in rise time to\npeak with increasing 56Ni mass, from ~15 to ~21d, yield peak bolometric\nluminosities that match Arnett's rule to within 10%, and reproduce the much\nsmaller scatter in near-IR magnitudes compared to the optical.

We use\ncylindrical coordinates with an isothermal equation of state and investigate a\nnumber of initial field geometries including toroidal, vertical, and vertical\nwith zero net flux. Our initial setup consists of a Keplerian disk attached to\na non-rotating star. In a previous work, we found that in hydrodynamical\nsimulations, sound waves excited by shear in the BL were able to efficiently\ntransport angular momentum and drive mass accretion onto the star. Here we\nconfirm that in MHD simulations, waves serve as an efficient means of angular\nmomentum transport in the vicinity of the BL, despite the magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI) operating in the disk. In particular, the angular momentum\ncurrent due to waves is at times larger than the angular momentum current due\nto MRI. Our results suggest that angular momentum transport in the BL and its\nvicinity is a global phenomenon occurring through dissipation of waves and\nshocks. This point of view is quite different from the standard picture of\ntransport by a local anomalous turbulent viscosity. In addition to angular\nmomentum transport, we also study magnetic field amplification within the BL.\nWe find that the field is indeed amplified in the BL, but only by a factor of a\nfew and remains subthermal. \n\n"}

According to this suggestion the SN progenitor\nsuffered a rapid expansion within months before explosion. The expansion was\ndriven by leakage of energy from the core where vigorous oxygen nuclear burning\ntakes place within a year prior to explosion. This expansion triggered mass\ntransfer onto the secondary star. Most of the extra energy of the outburst\ncomes from the accretion of ~0.1Mo onto the secondary star.

To\ncompare such models to observations, one must understand how to translate\nbetween surface densities observed averaging over large (~kpc) scales and\nsurface densities on the scale of individual clouds (~pc scale), which are\ntreated by models. We define a \"clumping factor\" that captures this translation\nas the ratio of the mass-weighted surface density, which is often the quantity\nof physical interest, to the area-weighted surface density, which is observed.\nWe use high spatial resolution (sub-kpc) maps of CO and HI emission from nearby\ngalaxies to measure the clumping factor of both atomic and molecular gas. The\nmolecular and atomic ISM exhibit dramatically different degrees of clumping. As\na result, the ratio H2/HI measured at ~kpc resolution cannot be trivially\ninterpreted as a cloud-scale ratio of surface densities. HI emission appears\nvery smooth, with a clumping factor of only ~1.3.

Therefore, knowledge of any\npotential biases and uncertainties in asteroseismic log(g) values is now\nbecoming important. Aims: The seismic parameter needed to derive log(g) is the\nfrequency of maximum oscillation power (nu_max). Here, we investigate the\ninfluence of nu_max derived with different methods on the derived log(g)\nvalues. The large frequency separation between modes of the same degree and\nconsecutive radial orders (Dnu) is often used as an additional constraint for\nthe determination of log(g). Additionally, we checked the influence of small\ncorrections applied to Dnu on the derived values of log(g).

I argue that V1309 Sco experienced an onset of dynamical mass loss\nthrough the outer Lagrange point, which eventually obscured the binary.

This is in contrast to many older\nstar clusters that show a decreasing binary frequency with radius. We study\nthis phenomenon with sophisticated N-body modeling, exploring a range of\ninitial conditions, from smooth virialized density distributions to highly\nsubstructured and collapsing configurations. We find that many of these models\ncan reproduce the cluster's observed properties, although with a modest\npreference for substructured initial conditions. Our models produce the\nobserved radial trend in binary frequency through disruption of soft binaries\n(with semi-major axes, a > 3000 AU), on approximately a crossing time (~ 5.4\nMyr), preferentially in the cluster core. Mass segregation subsequently causes\nthe binaries to sink towards the core. After roughly one initial half-mass\nrelaxation time (t_rh(0) ~ 340 Myr) the radial binary frequency distribution\nbecomes bimodal, the innermost binaries having already segregated towards the\ncore, leaving a minimum in the radial binary frequency distribution that\nmarches outwards with time. After 4-6 t_rh(0), the rising distribution in the\nhalo disappears, leaving a radial distribution that rises only towards the\ncore. Thus, both a radial binary frequency distribution that falls towards the\ncore (as observed for NGC 1818) and one that rises towards the core (as for\nolder star clusters) can arise naturally from the same evolutionary sequence\nowing to binary disruption and mass segregation in rich star clusters. \n\n"}

We employ a kinematic mean-field model for\npoloidal field transport and focus on steady states where inward advection of a\nfield balances with outward diffusion due to effective resistivities. We\nanalytically derive the steady-state radial distribution of poloidal fields in\nhighly conducting accretion disks. The analytic solution reveals an upper limit\non the strength of large-scale vertical fields attainable in steady states. Any\nexcess poloidal field will be diffused away within a finite time, and we\ndemonstrate this with time-dependent numerical calculations of the mean-field\nequations. We apply this upper limit to large-scale vertical fields threading\nprotoplanetary disks.

The latter in particular, however, requires knowledge\nof the properties of the individual components of the system. Here we present\nprecise optical spectroscopy of the inner companion in the PSR J0337+1715\nsystem. We confirm it as a hot, low-gravity DA white dwarf with\nTeff=15,800+/-100 K and log(g)=5.82+/-0.05. We also measure an inner mass ratio\nof 0.1364+/-0.0015, entirely consistent with that inferred from pulsar timing,\nand a systemic radial velocity of 29.7+/-0.3 km/s. Combined with the mass\n(0.19751 Msun) determined from pulsar timing, our measurement of the surface\ngravity implies a radius of 0.091+/-0.005 Rsun; combined further with the\neffective temperature and extinction, the photometry implies a distance of\n1300+/-80 pc.

We find that the C:O number\nratio for dusty AGB stars increases with distance from the LMC centre about\ntwice as fast as measured for near-IR selected samples of early AGB stars.\nDetailed radiative transfer models show that WISE colours are well explained by\nthe emission of centrally heated dusty shells where the dust has standard\nproperties of interstellar medium (ISM) grains. The segregation of different\nclasses of objects in WISE colour space arises from differences in properties\nof the dust shells: those around young stellar objects have uniform density\ndistributions while in evolved stars they have steep radial profiles. \n\n"}

Using the Mopra radio telescope, we observed the ground\nrotational transitions of HCO+, H13CO+, HCN, H13CN, HNC, and N2H+. These data\nare complemented with near-infrared extinction maps to constrain the column\ndensities, effective dust temperatures derived from Herschel data, and\nNH3-based gas kinetic temperatures. Results: The target cores are located\nacross the nebula, span visual extinctions between 5 and 67 mag, and effective\ndust temperatures (averaged along the lines of sight) between 13 and 19 K. The\nextinction-normalized integrated line intensities, a proxy for the abundance in\nconstant excitation conditions of optically thin lines, vary within an order of\nmagnitude for a given molecule. The effective dust temperatures and gas kinetic\ntemperatures are correlated, but the effective dust temperatures are\nconsistently higher than the gas kinetic temperatures. Combining the molecular\nline and temperature data, we find that N2H+ is only detected toward the\ncoldest and densest cores while other lines show no correlation with these core\nproperties. Conclusions: Within this large sample, N2H+ is the only species to\nexclusively trace the coldest and densest cores, in agreement with chemical\nconsiderations. In contrast, the common high-density tracers HCN and HNC are\npresent in a majority of cores, demonstrating the utility of these molecules to\ncharacterize cores over a large range of extinctions. The correlation between\nthe effective dust temperatures and the gas kinetic temperatures suggests that\nthe former are dominated by dust that is both dense and thermodynamically\ncoupled to the dense gas traced by NH3.

We present eleven new\nbinary candidates, confirm three previously reported candidates and rule out\ntwo previously identified candidates, all with primary and secondary spectral\ntypes between M7-L7 and T1-T8, respectively. We find that subdwarfs and blue L\ndwarfs are the primary contaminants in our sample and propose a method for\nsegregating these sources.

When the Prandtl number is large\n- such that turbulent diffusion of heat is unimportant - radial radiative\ndiffusion reduces the burst duration compared to models with no diffusive\ntransport of heat. When the Prandtl number is small ($\\lesssim 25$) we find\nthat turbulent diffusion dominates the radial transport of heat, reducing the\nburst duration to $\\lesssim 10^3$ years as well as increasing the burst\nfrequency.

The atmospheric parameters are\nextremely important because all the other stellar parameters depend on them.\nUsing our standard equivalent-width method on high-resolution spectroscopy,\ngood precision can be obtained for the derived effective temperature and\nmetallicity.

Our spectroscopic analysis is based on Kurucz models in\nLTE, performed with the MOOG code to derive the atmospheric parameters.

The observations, made with the IRAM 30-m telescope,\nhave a sensibility, calibration, and angular resolution far higher than\nprevious studies. The angular resolution is 11\", which corresponds to an\nexpansion time of 500 yr. The CO emission consists of a centrally peaked\npedestal and a series of bright, nearly spherical shells. It peaks on CW Leo\nand remains relatively strong up to 180\". Further out it becomes very weak and\nvanishes as CO gets photodissociated. The CO maps allow to trace the mass loss\nhistory in the last 8000 yr. The bright CO shells denote overdense regions,\nwhich indicate that the mass loss process is highly variable on timescales of\nhundreds of years. The new data, however, infirm previous claims of a strong\ndecrease of the average mass loss in the last few thousand years. The overdense\nshells are not perfectly concentric and extend farther to the N-NW. The typical\nshell separation is 800-1000 yr in the middle of the envelope, but seems to\nincrease outwards. The shell-intershell brightness contrast is $\\geq$ 3. All\nthose key features can be accounted for if CW Leo has a companion star with a\nperiod of $\\sim$ 800 yr that increases the mass loss rate when it comes close\nto periastron. Higher angular resolution observations are needed to fully\nresolve the dense shells and measure the density contrast. The latter plays an\nessential role for our understanding of the envelope chemistry. \n\n"}

We\nargue that magnetic field decay builds up stresses in a neutron star's crust,\nas the elastic shear force resists the Lorentz force's desire to rearrange the\nglobal magnetic-field equilibrium. We derive a criterion for crust-breaking\ninduced by a changing magnetic-field configuration, and use this to investigate\nstrain patterns in a neutron star's crust for a variety of different\nmagnetic-field models. Universally, we find that the crust is most liable to\nbreak if the magnetic field has a strong toroidal component, in which case the\nepicentre of the crustquake is around the equator. We calculate the energy\nreleased in a crustquake as a function of the fracture depth, finding that it\nis independent of field strength.

We combine\nX-ray stacking and far-IR photometry of stellar mass-limited samples of normal\nstar-forming, starburst and quiescent/quenched galaxies in the COSMOS field.

Red timing noise - the stochastic wandering of\npulse arrival times with a red spectrum - is prevalent in slow-spinning pulsars\nand has been identified in many millisecond pulsars. Phenomenological models of\ntiming noise, such as from superfluid turbulence, suggest that the timing noise\nspectrum plateaus below some critical frequency, $f_c$, potentially aiding the\nhunt for gravitational waves. We examine this effect for individual pulsars by\ncalculating minimum observation times, $T_{\\rm min}(f_c)$, over which the\ngravitational wave signal becomes larger than the timing noise plateau. We do\nthis in two ways: 1) in a model-independent manner, and 2) by using the\nsuperfluid turbulence model for timing noise as an example to illustrate how\nneutron star parameters can be constrained. We show that the superfluid\nturbulence model can reproduce the data qualitatively from a number of pulsars\nobserved as part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array.

Aside from field stars, the Sgr dSph is suspected to have\nlost a number of globular clusters (GC). Many Galactic GC are suspected to have\noriginated in the Sgr dSph.

NGC 5053 and NGC 5634 are two among\nthese scarcely studied Sgr dSph candidate-member clusters. To characterize\ntheir composition we analyzed one giant star in NGC 5053, and two in NGC 5634.\nWe analize high-resolution and signal-to-noise spectra by means of the MyGIsFOS\ncode, determining atmospheric parameters and abundances for up to 21 species\nbetween O and Eu. The abundances are compared with those of MW halo field\nstars, of \"unassociated\" MW halo globulars, and of the metal poor Sgr dSph main\nbody population.\n  We derive a metallicity of [FeII/H]=-2.26+-0.10 for NGC 5053, and of\n[FeI/H]=-1.99+-0.075 and -1.97+-0.076 for the two stars in NGC 5634. This makes\nNGC 5053 one of the most metal poor globular clusters in the MW. Both clusters\ndisplay an alpha enhancement similar to the one of the halo at comparable\nmetallicity. The two stars in NGC 5634 clearly display the Na-O anticorrelation\nwidespread among MW globulars. Most other abundances are in good agreement with\nstandard MW halo trends.

It is thus difficult to\ndiscriminate between an origin of NGC 5053 and NGC 5634 in the Sgr dSph, and\none in the MW.

Comparison of this fraction in this period\nrange (1-20 years) implies a large fraction for the full period range.

In a static spherical galaxy model, the binary stalls at a\nseparation of about a parsec after ejecting all the stars in its loss cone --\nthis is the well-known final parsec problem.

Here we use a suite of direct\nN-body simulations to follow SMBH binary evolution in both corotating and\ncounterrotating flattened galaxy models. For N larger than 500K, we find that\nthe evolution of the SMBH binary is convergent, and is independent of the\nparticle number. Rotation in general increases the hardening rate of SMBH\nbinaries even more effectively than galaxy geometry alone. SMBH binary\nhardening rates are similar for co- and counterrotating galaxies.

We looked for IR excesses in the remaining sources,\nidentifying 28 that have significant IR excesses by ~20 um (with possible\nexcesses for 2 additional sources). There appears to be an intriguing\ncorrelation in that the largest IR excesses are all in Li-rich K giants, though\nvery few Li-rich K giants have IR excesses (large or small).

One dimensional hydrostatic calculations\npredict an unstable density inversion at this location, whereas our simulations\nreveal a complex interplay of convective and radiative transport whose behavior\ndepends on the ratio of the photon diffusion time to the dynamical time. The\nlatter is set by the ratio of the optical depth per pressure scale height,\n$\\tau_0$, to $\\tau_c=c/c_g$, where $c_g \\approx$ 50 km/s is the isothermal\nsound speed in the gas alone. When $\\tau_0 \\gg \\tau_c$, convection reduces the\nradiation acceleration and removes the density inversion. The turbulent energy\ntransport in the simulations agrees with mixing length theory and provides its\nfirst numerical calibration in the radiation dominated regime.

Density perturbations that enter the horizon during the\nmatter-dominated phase grow linearly with the scale factor prior to the onset\nof radiation domination, which leads to enhanced inhomogeneity on small scales\nif dark matter thermally and kinetically decouples during the matter-dominated\nphase. The microhalos that form from these enhanced perturbations significantly\nboost the self-annihilation rate for dark matter. This has important\nimplications for indirect detection experiments: the larger annihilation rate\nwill result in observable signals from dark matter candidates that are usually\ndeemed untestable. As a proof of principle, we consider Binos in heavy\nsupersymmetry with an intermediate extended Higgs sector and all other\nsuperpartners decoupled.

The lower\nfraction of quiescent galaxies seen in large-scale dense environments, if\nconfirmed to be true, may be associated with the fact that the star formation\ncan be more easily sustained via cold stream accretion in `large-scale'\nhigh-density regions, preventing galaxies from permanent quenching.

Abstract: Large dust grains can fluctuate dramatically in their local density, relative\nto gas, in neutral, turbulent disks. Small, high-redshift galaxies (before\nreionization) represent ideal environments for this process. We show via simple\narguments and simulations that order-of-magnitude fluctuations are expected in\nlocal abundances of large grains under these conditions. This can have\nimportant consequences for star formation and stellar abundances in extremely\nmetal-poor stars. Low-mass stars could form in dust-enhanced regions almost\nimmediately after some dust forms, even if the galaxy-average metallicity is\ntoo low for fragmentation to occur. The abundances of these 'promoted' stars\nmay contain interesting signatures, as the CNO abundances (concentrated in\nlarge carbonaceous grains and ices) and Mg and Si (in large silicate grains)\ncan be enhanced or fluctuate independently. Remarkably, otherwise puzzling\nabundance patterns of some metal-poor stars can be well-fit by standard\ncore-collapse SNe yields, if we allow for fluctuating dust-to-gas ratios. We\nalso show that the observed log-normal-like distribution of enhancements in\nthese species agrees with our simulations. Moreover, we confirm Mg and Si are\ncorrelated in these stars, with abundance ratios similar to those in local\nsilicate grains. Meanwhile [Mg/Ca], predicted to be nearly invariant from pure\nSNe yields, shows large enhancements as expected in the dust-promoted model,\npreferentially in the [C/Fe]-enhanced metal-poor stars. This suggests that (1)\ndust exists in second-generation star formation, (2) dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations occur and can be important for star formation, and (3) light\nelement abundances of these stars may be affected by the chemistry of dust\nwhere they formed, rather than directly tracing nucleosynthesis. \n\n"}

These models predict the formation of\ncounter-rotating disks with a deep gap in the gas surface density separating\nthe inner disk (corotating with the star) and the outer counter-rotating disk.\nThe properties of these gaps are compared to those of planet-bearing gaps that\nform in disks hosting giant planets. We employ numerical hydrodynamics\nsimulations of collapsing cores that are replenished from the local\ncounter-rotating environment, as well as numerical hydrodynamic simulations of\nisolated disks hosting giant planets, to derive the properties of the gaps that\nform in both cases. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that counter-rotating\ndisks can form for a wide range of mass and angular momentum available in the\nlocal environment. The gap that separates both disks has a depletion factor\nsmaller than 1%, can be located at a distance from ten to over a hundred AU\nfrom the star, and can propagate inward with velocity ranging from 1 AU/Myr to\n>100 AU/Myr.

A Consistent 10 Myr Age for the Upper Scorpius OB\n  Association Abstract: When determining absolute ages of identifiably young stellar populations,\nresults strongly depend on which stars are studied. Cooler (K, M) stars\ntypically yield ages that are systematically younger than warmer (A, F, G)\nstars by a factor of two. I explore the possibility that these age\ndiscrepancies are the result of magnetic inhibition of convection in cool young\nstars by using magnetic stellar evolution isochrones to determine the age of\nthe Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association. A median\nage of 10 Myr consistent across spectral types A through M is found, except for\na subset of F-type stars that appear significantly older. Agreement is shown\nfor ages derived from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and from the empirical\nmass-radius relationship defined by eclipsing multiple-star systems. Surface\nmagnetic field strengths required to produce agreement are of order 2.5 kG and\nare predicted from a priori estimates of equipartition values. A region in the\nHR diagram is identified that plausibly connects stars whose structures are\nweakly influenced by the presence of magnetic fields with those whose\nstructures are strongly influenced by magnetic fields. The models suggest this\nregion is characterized by stars with rapidly thinning outer convective\nenvelopes where the radiative core mass is greater than 75% of the total\nstellar mass. Furthermore, depletion of lithium predicted from magnetic models\nappears in better agreement with observed lithium equivalent widths than\npredictions from non-magnetic models. These results suggest that magnetic\ninhibition of convection plays an important role in the early evolution of\nlow-mass stars and that it may be responsible for noted age discrepancies in\nyoung stellar populations. \n\n"}

We find a mean age of the region of\n1.04+-0.72 Myr. The combination of dereddened F555W and F814W photometry in\ncombination with F658N photometry allows us to study and identify stars with\nH_alpha excess emission. With a careful selection of 240 bona-fide PMS H_alpha\nexcess emitters we were able to determine their H_alpha luminosity, which has a\nmean value L(H_alpha)=1.67 x 10^{-31} erg s^{-1}. Using the PARSEC 1.2S\nisochrones to obtain the stellar parameters of the PMS stars we determined a\nmean mass accretion rate \\dot M_acc=4.43 x 10^{-8} M_sun yr^{-1} per star. A\ncareful analysis of the spatial dependence of the mass-accretion rate suggests\nthat this rate is ~25% lower in center of the two density peaks of Wd2 in close\nproximity to the luminous OB stars, compared to the Wd2 average. This rate is\nhigher with increasing distance from the OB stars, indicating that the PMS\naccretion disks are being rapidly destroyed by the far-ultra-violet radiation\nemitted by the OB population. \n\n"}

We have recently investigated the origin of chemical signatures\nobserved in Galactic halo stars by means of a stochastic chemical evolution\nmodel. We have found that rotating massive stars are a promising way to explain\nseveral signatures observed in these fossil stars. Aims. In the present paper\nwe discuss how the extremely metal-poor halo star TYC 8442-1036-1, for which we\nhave now obtained detailed abundances from VLT-UVES spectra, fits into the\nframework of our previous work. Methods. We apply a standard 1D LTE analysis to\nthe spectrum of this star. We measure the abundances of 14 chemical elements;\nfor Na, Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Zn we compute the abundances\nusing equivalent widths; for C, Sr and Ba we obtain the abundances by means of\nsynthetic spectra generated by MOOG. Results. We find an abundance of [Fe/H]=\n$-$3.5 $\\pm$0.13 dex based on our high resolution spectrum; this points to an\niron content lower by a factor of three (0.5 dex) compared to the one obtained\nby a low resolution spectrum. The star has a [C/Fe] = 0.4 dex, and it is not\ncarbon enhanced like most of the stars at this metallicity. Moreover, this star\nlies in the plane [Ba/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] in a relatively unusual position, shared\nby a few others galactic halo stars that is only marginally explained by our\npast results. Conclusions. The comparison of the model results with the\nchemical abundance characteristics of this group of stars can be improved if we\nconsider in our model the presence of faint supernovae coupled with rotating\nmassive stars. These results seem to imply that rotating massive stars and\nfaint supernovae scenarios are complementary to each other, and are both\nrequired in order to match the observed chemistry of the earliest phases of the\nchemical enrichment of the Universe. \n\n"}

Core creation is\nregarded as one of the most promising solutions to potential issues faced by\nthe lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmology on small scales. For example,\nthe reduced dynamical mass enclosed by cores can explain the low rotational\nvelocities measured for nearby dwarf galaxies, thus possibly lifting the\nseeming contradiction with the LambdaCDM expectations (the so-called \"too big\nto fail\" problem). Here we test core creation as a solution of cosmological\nissues by using a sample of dwarfs with measurements of their atomic hydrogen\n(HI) kinematics extending to large radii. Using the NIHAO hydrodynamical\nsimulation as an example, we show that core creation can successfully reproduce\nthe kinematics of dwarfs with small kinematic radii, R <~ 1.5 kpc. However, the\nagreement with observations becomes poor once galaxies with kinematic\nmeasurements extending beyond the core region, R ~ 1.5 - 4 kpc, are considered.\nThis result illustrates the importance of testing the predictions of\nhydrodynamical simulations that are relevant for cosmology against a broad\nrange of observational samples. We would like to stress that our result is\nvalid only under the following set of assumptions: i) that our sample of dwarfs\nwith HI kinematics is representative of the overall population of field dwarfs,\nii) that there are no severe measurement biases in the observational parameters\nof our HI dwarfs (e.g., related to inclination estimates), and iii) that the HI\nvelocity fields of dwarfs are regular enough to allow the recovery of the true\nenclosed dynamical mass. \n\n"}

When we separate the BSS into two samples\nby their magnitude, we find that the bright BSS show a much more centrally\nconcentrated radial distribution and thus higher mass estimate (over twice the\nTO mass for these BSS systems), suggesting an origin involving triple or\nmultiple stellar systems.

We examine the wind conditions and dynamic pressure over different\nplausible orbits that sample the constrained parameters of the orbit of Proxima\nb. For all the parameter space explored, the planet is subject to stellar wind\npressures of more than 2000 times those experienced by Earth from the solar\nwind. During an orbit, Proxima b is also subject to pressure changes of 1 to 3\norders of magnitude on timescales of a day.

We use the IRAM 30m telescope and the PdBI to study\nthe chemical and physical properties of the starless core FeSt 1-457 (Core\n109), in the Pipe nebula. We fit the hyperfine structure of the N2H+(1-0) IRAM\n30m data. This allow us to measure with high precision the velocity field, line\nwidths and opacity and derive the excitation temperature and column density in\nthe core. We use a modified Bonnor-Ebert sphere model adding a temperature\ngradient towards the center to fit the 1.2 mm continuum emission and visual\nextinction maps. Using this model, we estimate the abundances of the N2H+ and\nthe rest of molecular lines detected in the 30 GHz wide line survey performed\nat 3 mm with IRAM 30m using ARTIST software. The core presents a rich chemistry\nwith emission from early (C3H2, HCN, CS) and late-time molecules (e.g., N2H+),\nwith a clear chemical spatial differentiation for nitrogen, oxygen and\nsulphurated molecules. For most of the molecules detected (HCN, HCO+, CH3OH,\nCS, SO, 13CO and C18O), abundances are best fitted with three values,\npresenting a clear decrease of abundance of at least 1 or 2 orders of magnitude\ntowards the center of the core. The Bonnor-Ebert analysis indicates the core is\ngravitationally unstable and the magnetic field is not strong enough to avoid\nthe collapse. Depletion of molecules onto the dust grains occurs at the\ninterior of the core, where dust grain growth and dust depolarization also\noccurs. This suggests that these properties may be related.

These asymmetries could be due to a stronger interstellar radiation\nfield in the western side of the core. \n\n"}

Determining gas\nand dust mass-loss rates (MLRs) is important in quantifying the contribution of\nevolved stars to the enrichment of the interstellar medium. Aims: Attempt to,\nfor the first time, spectrally resolve CO thermal line emission in a small\nsample of AGB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Methods: ALMA was used to\nobserve 2 OH/IR stars and 4 carbon stars in the LMC in the CO J= 2-1 line.\nResults: We present the first measurement of expansion velocities in\nextragalactic carbon stars. All four C-stars are detected and wind expansion\nvelocities and stellar velocities are directly measured. Mass-loss rates are\nderived from modelling the spectral energy distribution and Spitzer/IRS\nspectrum with the DUSTY code. Gas-to-dust ratios are derived that make the\npredicted velocities agree with the observed ones. The expansion velocities and\nMLRs are compared to a Galactic sample of well-studied relatively low MLRs\nstars supplemented with \"extreme\" C-stars that have properties more similar to\nthe LMC targets. Gas MLRs derived from a simple formula are significantly\nsmaller than derived from the dust modelling, indicating an order of magnitude\nunderestimate of the estimated CO abundance, time-variable mass loss, or that\nthe CO intensities in LMC stars are lower than predicted by the formula derived\nfor Galactic objects. This could be related to a stronger interstellar\nradiation field in the LMC. Conclusions: Although the LMC sample is small and\nthe comparison to Galactic stars is non-trivial because of uncertainties in\ntheir distances it appears that for C stars the wind expansion velocities in\nthe LMC are lower than in the solar neighbourhood, while the MLRs appear\nsimilar. This is in agreement with dynamical dust-driven wind models. \n\n"}

The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution. Assuming that early stellar\ndiscs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random\nmotions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density\ndistributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars. We then use a\nhigh-resolution simulation, in which all stars form out of gas, to demonstrate\nthat this is what happens.

An additional, and equally\nimportant, aim of this pilot study is to investigate the consistency between\nthe predictions of several BH scaling relations and the fundamental plane of\nblack hole activity (FP-BH). Methods: We use X-ray and radio luminosity\nrelations in accreting BHs, along with the latest scaling relations between the\nmass of the central black hole (MBH) and the properties of its host spheroid,\nto predict MBH in seven LLAGN, that were previously reported to be in the IMBH\nregime. Namely, we use the recently re-evaluated MBH - Msph (Msph : spheroid\nabsolute magnitude at 3.6 microm) scaling relation for spiral galaxies, the MBH\n- nsph (nsph : major axis Sersic index of the bulge) relation, the MBH - PA\n(PA: pitch angle) relation and the FP-BH for weakly accreting BHs, to\nindependently estimate MBH in all seven galaxies. Results: We find that all\nLLAGN in our list have low-mass central black holes - with log MBH/Msol~6.5 on\naverage - but they are, not IMBHs. All 4 methods used predicted consistent BH\nmasses, in the 1sigma range.

We aim\nto quantify the importance of a treatment of the ionisation fraction in\nturbulent magnetised media and investigate the effect of turbulence on shaping\nthe clouds and filaments before star formation sets in. In particular, we\ninvestigate how the structure, mass and width of filamentary structures depend\non the amount of turbulence in ionised media and the initial mass-to-flux\nratio. We compare the resulting density and mass-to-flux ratio structures both\nqualitatively and quantitatively via filament and core masses and filament\nfitting techniques (Gaussian and Plummer profiles.) We find that even with\nalmost no turbulence, filamentary structure still exists. Comparison of\nsimulations show that for turbulent Mach numbers above 2, there is little\nstructural difference between the Step-Like (SL) and Cosmic Ray only (CR-only)\nionisation models, while below this threshold the ionisation structure\nsignificantly affects the formation of filaments.

By determining the abundances of\nthese molecules, we aim to use the derived isotopologue --- and hence oxygen\nisotope --- ratios to put constraints on the masses of a sample of M-type AGB\nstars that have not been classified as OH/IR stars. METHODS: We use detailed\nradiative transfer analysis based on the accelerated lambda iteration method to\nmodel the circumstellar molecular line emission of H$_2$$^{17}$O and\nH$_2$$^{18}$O for IK Tau, R Dor, W Hya, and R Cas. The emission lines used to\nconstrain our models come from Herschel/HIFI and Herschel/PACS observations and\nare all optically thick, meaning that full radiative transfer analysis is the\nonly viable method of estimating molecular abundance ratios. RESULTS: We find\ngenerally low values of the $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O ratio for our sample, ranging\nfrom 0.15 to 0.69. This correlates with relatively low initial masses, in the\nrange $\\sim1.0$ to 1.5 M$_\\odot$ for each source, based on stellar evolutionary\nmodels. We also find ortho-to-para ratios close to 3, which are expected from\nwarm formation predictions. CONCLUSIONS: The $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O ratios found for\nthis sample are at the lower end of the range predicted by stellar evolutionary\nmodels, indicating that the sample chosen had relatively low initial masses. \n\n"}

Low-mass galaxies generate\noutflows faster than their escape velocities with mass outflow rates up to\ntwenty times larger than their star formation rates. These outflows from\nlow-mass galaxies also have momenta larger than provided from supernovae alone,\nindicating that multiple momentum sources drive these outflows.

It is applicable to any\ncombination of parameters and works in arbitrary numbers of dimensions.\nFurthermore, it is not restricted to color space. Extinction towards single\nsources is determined by fitting Gaussian Mixture Models along the extinction\nvector to (extinction-free) control field observations. In this way it becomes\npossible to describe the extinction for observed sources with probability\ndensities.

In\nthis article, we discuss a possible resolution of this tension between the TeV\ngamma-ray observations and the CIB data in terms of axion [or Axion-Like\nParticles (ALPs)] that may increase the transparency of the Universe by the\nanomaly-induced photon-axion mixing. We find a region in the parameter space of\nthe axion mass, $m_a \\sim 7 \\times 10^{-10} - 5 \\times 10^{-8}$eV, and the\naxion-photon coupling constant, $1.2 \\times 10^{-11} {\\rm GeV}^{-1} \\lesssim\ng_{a\\gamma} \\lesssim 8.8 \\times 10^{-10} {\\rm GeV}^{-1}$ that solves this\nproblem. \n\n"}

Dust scattering was\nrecently recognized as a potential contributor to polarization, although its\nbasic properties have yet to be thoroughly explored. Here, we quantify the\neffects of optical depth on the scattering-induced polarization in inclined\ndisks through a combination of analytical illustration, approximate\nsemi-analytical modeling using formal solution to the radiative transfer\nequation, and Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the near-side of the disk\nis significantly brighter in polarized intensity than the far-side, provided\nthat the disk is optically thick and that the scattering grains have yet to\nsettle to the midplane. This asymmetry is the consequence of a simple geometric\neffect: the near-side of the disk surface is viewed more edge-on than the\nfar-side. It is a robust signature that may be used to distinguish the\nscattering-induced polarization from that by other mechanisms, such as aligned\ngrains. The asymmetry is weaker for a geometrically thinner dust disk. As such,\nit opens an exciting new window on dust settling. We find anecdotal evidence\nfrom dust continuum imaging of edge-on disks that large grains are not yet\nsettled in the youngest (Class 0) disks, but become more so in older disks.\nThis trend is corroborated by the polarization data in inclined disks showing\nthat younger disks have more pronounced near-far side asymmetry and thus less\ngrain settling.

Hydrogen deuteride (HD) is a promising\nalternative to the commonly-used gas mass tracer, CO. We aim to examine the\nrobustness of HD as tracer of the disk gas mass, specifically the effect of gas\nmass on the HD FIR emission and its sensitivity to the vertical structure.\nDeuterium chemistry reactions relevant for HD were implemented in the\nthermochemical code DALI and models were run for a range of disk masses and\nvertical structures. The HD J=1-0 line intensity depends directly on the gas\nmass through a sublinear power law relation with a slope of ~0.8.

For more massive disks, this\nuncertainty increases to more than an order of magnitude. Adding the HD 2-1\nline or independent information about the vertical structure can reduce this\nuncertainty to a factor of ~3 for all disk masses.

The Early Break-Out Phase Abstract: In this series of papers, we model the formation and evolution of the\nphotoionized region and its observational signatures during massive star\nformation. Here we focus on the early break out of the photoionized region into\nthe outflow cavity. Using results of 3-D magnetohydrodynamic-outflow\nsimulations and protostellar evolution calculations, we perform post-processing\nradiative-transfer. The photoionized region first appears at a protostellar\nmass of 10Msun in our fiducial model, and is confined to within 10-100AU by the\ndense inner outflow, similar to some observed very small hypercompact HII\nregions. Since the ionizing luminosity of the massive protostar increases\ndramatically as Kelvin-Helmholz (KH) contraction proceeds, the photoionized\nregion breaks out to the entire outflow region in <10,000yr. Accordingly, the\nradio free-free emission brightens significantly in this stage. In our fiducial\nmodel, the radio luminosity at 10 GHz changes from 0.1 mJy kpc2 at m=11Msun to\n100 mJy kpc2 at 16Msun, while the infrared luminosity increases by less than a\nfactor of two. The radio spectral index also changes in the break-out phase\nfrom the optically thick value of 2 to the partially optically thin value of\n0.6. Additionally, we demonstrate that short-timescale variation in free-free\nflux would be induced by an accretion burst. The outflow density is enhanced in\nthe accretion burst phase, which leads to a smaller ionized region and weaker\nfree-free emission. The radio luminosity may decrease by one order of magnitude\nduring such bursts, while the infrared luminosity is much less affected, since\ninternal protostellar luminosity dominates over accretion luminosity after KH\ncontraction starts. Such variability may be observable on timescales as short\n10-100 yr, if accretion bursts are driven by disk instabilities. \n\n"}

Flocculent\ngalaxies are clearly distinguished from other spiral arm classes, especially by\ntheir lower stellar mass and surface density. Multi-armed and grand-design\ngalaxies are similar in most of their fundamental parameters, excluding some\nbar properties and the bulge-to-total ratio. Based on these results, we revisit\nthe sequence of spiral arm classes, and discuss classical bulges as a necessary\ncondition for standing spiral wave modes in grand-design galaxies.

This depression is much greater than that\nexpected from the neglect of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects, in\nparticular the dominant effect of overionisation.

Various uncertainties\nare explored. We reproduce the large Fe I depression found by the recent study,\nusing different observational data and computational tools. Further\ninvestigation shows that the degree of the apparent Fe I depression is strongly\ndependent on the adopted stellar effective temperature. To minimise\nuncertainties in Fe I we derive temperatures for each star individually using\nthe infrared flux method (IRFM). We find that the $T_{\\rm{eff}}$ scales used by\nboth the previous studies are cooler, by up to 100 K; such underestimated\ntemperatures amplify the apparent Fe I depression.

We investigated the\nconfiguration of the binaries in the program, and discovered new companions for\nHIP 6407, HIP 54582, HIP 62039 and HIP 30037, of which the latter is orbited by\na $0.06$ M$_\\odot$ brown dwarf in a 1-month long orbit. We report the orbital\nparameters of the systems with well-sampled orbits and, in addition, the lower\nlimits of parameters for the companions that only display a curvature in their\nradial velocities. For the linear trend binaries, we report an estimate of the\nmasses of their companions when their observed separation is available, and a\nminimum mass otherwise. We conclude that solar twin binaries with low-mass\nstellar companions at moderate orbital periods do not display signs of a\ndistinct rotational evolution when compared to single stars. We confirm that\nthe three peculiar stars are double-lined binaries, and that their companions\nare polluting their spectra, which explains the observed anomalies. \n\n"}

Such\nencounters could influence the solar system, for example through gravitational\nperturbations of the Oort cloud. 16 stars are found to come within 2 pc\n(although a few of these have dubious data). This is fewer than were found in a\nsimilar study based on Hipparcos data, even though the present study has many\nmore candidates. This is partly because I reject stars with large radial\nvelocity uncertainties (>10 km/s), and partly because of missing stars in GDR1\n(especially at the bright end). The closest encounter found is Gl 710, a K\ndwarf long-known to come close to the Sun in about 1.3 Myr. The Gaia astrometry\npredict a much closer passage than pre-Gaia estimates, however: just 16 000 AU\n(90% confidence interval: 10 000 to 21 000 AU), which will bring this star well\nwithin the Oort cloud.

Abstract: The processes taking place in the outermost reaches of spiral disks (the\n'proto-disk') are intimately connected to the build-up of mass and angular\nmomentum in galaxies. The thinness of spiral disks suggests that the activity\nis mostly quiescent and presumably this region is fed by cool flows coming into\nthe halo from the intergalactic medium. While there is abundant evidence for\nthe presence of a circumgalactic medium (CGM) around disk galaxies as traced by\nquasar absorption lines, it has been very difficult to connect this material to\nthe outer gas disk. This has been a very difficult transition region to explore\nbecause baryon tracers are hard to observe. In particular, HI disks have been\nargued to truncate at a critical column density N(H) $\\approx 3\\times 10^{19}$\ncm$^{-2}$ at 30 kpc for an L* galaxy where the gas is vulnerable to the\nexternal ionizing background. But new deep observations of nearby L* spirals\n(e.g. Milky Way, NGC 2997) suggest that HI disks may extend much further than\nrecognised to date, up to 60 kpc at N(H) $\\approx 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$.

We measure the axial dipole moment\nusing the photospheric synoptic magnetogram observed by the Wilcox Solar\nObservatory (WSO), the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Michelson\nDoppler Imager (MDI), and the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager (HMI). We also use the surface flux transport model for the\ninterpretation and prediction of the observed axial dipole moment. Results. We\nfind that the observed axial dipole moment becomes approximately constant\nduring the period of several years before each cycle minimum, which we call the\naxial dipole moment plateau. The cross-equatorial magnetic flux transport is\nfound to be small during the period, although the significant number of\nsunspots are still emerging. The results indicates that the newly emerged\nmagnetic flux does not contributes to the build up of the axial dipole moment\nnear the end of each cycle. This is confirmed by showing that the time\nvariation of the observed axial dipole moment agrees well with that predicted\nby the SFT model without introducing new emergence of magnetic flux. These\nresults allows us to predict the axial dipole moment in Cycle 24/25 minimum\nusing the SFT model without introducing new flux emergence. The predicted axial\ndipole moment of Cycle 24/25 minimum is 60--80 percent of Cycle 23/24 minimum,\nwhich suggests the amplitude of Cycle 25 even weaker than the current Cycle 24.\nConclusions. The plateau of the solar axial dipole moment is an important\nfeature for the longer prediction of the solar cycle based on the SFT model. \n\n"}

The assumption that an assortment of SUSY breaking F and D terms are\npresent in the hidden sector, and their values are uniformly distributed in the\nlandscape of D=4, N=1 effective supergravity models, leads to the expectation\nthat the landscape pulls towards large values of soft terms favored by a power\nlaw behavior P(m(soft))~ m(soft)^n. On the other hand, similar to Weinberg's\nprediction of the cosmological constant, one can assume an anthropic selection\nof weak scales not too far from the measured value characterized by m(W,Z,h)~\n100 GeV. Working within a fertile patch of gravity-mediated low energy\neffective theories where the superpotential mu term is << m(3/2), as occurs in\nmodels such as radiative breaking of Peccei-Quinn symmetry, this biases\nstatistical distributions on the landscape by a cutoff on the parameter\nDelta(EW), which measures fine-tuning in the m(Z)-mu mass relation.

The\nself-similarity of the temperature profiles and tight mass--temperature\nrelation of relaxed cool-core clusters suggest that the maximum effect of\nsedimentation take place in the most massive virialized objects in the\nUniverse. However, Chandra and XMM-Newton observations demonstrate more complex\nscaling relations between the masses of early-type galaxies and other\nparameters, such as the ISM temperature and gas mass fraction.

The velocity profile is not\nconsistent with the HI gas cooling from the hot wind. We demonstrate that the\nvelocity decrease is substantially greater than the deceleration expected from\ngravitational forces alone.

We find that\nthe differential desorption of volatile species is amplified by the grains\nlarger than 0.1 $\\mu$m, because larger grains are heated to a lower temperature\nby cosmic-rays and hence more sensitive to the variations in binding energies.\nAs a result, atomic nitrogen N is $\\sim$2 orders of magnitude more abundant\nthan CO; N$_2$H$^+$ also becomes a few times more abundant than HCO$^+$ due to\nthe increased gas-phase N$_2$. However, the changes in ionization fraction due\nto freeze-out and desorption only have minor effects on the non-ideal MHD\ndiffusivities. Our chemical network confirms that the very small grains (VSGs:\nbelow a few 100 $\\AA$) weakens the efficiency of both ambipolar diffusion and\nHall effect. In collapsing dense cores, a maximum ambipolar diffusion is\nachieved when truncating the MRN size distribution at 0.1 $\\mu$m, and for a\nmaximum Hall effect, the truncation occurs at 0.04 $\\mu$m.

The tidal disruption of stellar binaries by a massive BH is\nknown to produce hypervelocity stars. However, such a tidal encounter does not\nalways lead to the break-up of binaries. Since surviving binaries tend to\nbecome hard and eccentric, this process can produce BH mergers in principle.\nFor initially circular binaries, we show that the gravitational wave (GW)\nmerger times become shorter by a factor of more than $10^{2}$ ($10^5$) in\n$10\\%$ ($1\\%$) of the surviving cases. This reduction is primarily due to the\ngrowth in binary's eccentricity at the tidal encounter. We also investigate the\neffective spins of the survivors, assuming that BH spins are initially aligned\nwith the binary orbital angular momentum. We find that binary orientations can\nflip in the opposite direction at the tidal encounter. For the survivors with\nlarge merger time reduction factors, the effective spin distribution is rather\nflat. We estimate the merger rate due to the tidal encounter channel to be\n$\\sim 0.6\\ \\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$.

The detection of this gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, offers a\nnovel opportunity to directly probe the properties of matter at the extreme\nconditions found in the interior of these stars.

Here, we present the chemical\nmodeling of glycine in hot cores using the state-of-the-art three-phase\nchemical model NAUTILUS, which is focused on the latest glycine chemistry. For\nthe formation process of glycine on the grain surface, we obtained consistent\nresults with previous studies that glycine would be formed via the reactions of\nCOOH with CH$_2$NH$_2$. However, we will report three important findings\nregarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine.\nFirst, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature\nprogrammed thermal desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine\nwas destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH$_3$O radicals\nbefore it fully evaporates. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase\nis more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case,\nNH$_2$OH and CH$_3$COOH rather than CH$_3$NH$_2$ and CH$_2$NH would be the\nessential precursors to the gas phase glycine. Secondly, since the gas phase\nglycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, early\nevolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the\nfuture glycine surveys. Thirdly, we suggest the possibility that the\nsuprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH\nradicals from CO$_2$, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of\nglycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in\ndetail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future. \n\n"}

The\nGalactic inheritance broadly explains most of them, especially if $r$-process\nnuclei are produced by neutron star merging according to recent models.\nInstead, $^{26}$Al, $^{41}$Ca, $^{135}$Cs and possibly $^{60}$Fe require\nnucleosynthesis events close to the solar formation. We outline the persisting\ndifficulties to account for these nuclei by Intermediate Mass Stars (2\n$\\lesssim $ M/M$_\\odot \\lesssim 7 - 8$).

Although large\ncarbon-bearing molecules have been proposed as the carriers producing DIBs,\ntheir identity remains unknown. The sight line to the young massive\nstar-forming region M17 shows anomalous extinction in the sense that the\ntotal-to-selective extinction parameter differs significantly from the average\nGalactic value and may reach values $R_{V} > 4$. Given the high $R_V$ values,\nwe investigate whether the DIBs in sight lines towards young OB stars in M17\nshow a peculiar behaviour. We measure the properties of the most prominent DIBs\nin M17 and study these as a function of $E(B-V)$ and $R_{V}$. The DIB strengths\nin M17 concur with the observed relations between DIB equivalent width and\nreddening $E(B-V)$ in Galactic sight lines. For several DIBs we discover a\nlinear relation between the normalised DIB strength EW/$A_{V}$ and\n$R_{V}^{-1}$. These trends suggest two groups: (i) a group of ten moderately\nstrong DIBs that show a sensitivity to changes in $R_{V}$ that is modest and\nproportional to DIB strength, and (ii) a group of four very strong DIBs that\nreact sensitively and to a similar degree to changes in $R_{V}$, but in a way\nthat does not appear to depend on DIB strength. The DIB behaviour as a function\nof reddening is not peculiar in sight lines to M17. Also, we do not detect\nanomalous DIB profiles as seen in Her 36. DIBs are stronger, per unit visual\nextinction, in sight lines characterised by a smaller value of $R_{V}$ (large\nfraction of small dust particles). New relations between extinction normalised\nDIB strengths, EW/$A_V$, and $R_V$ support the idea that DIB carriers and\ninterstellar dust are connected. Given the distinct behaviour of two groups of\nDIBs, different types of carriers do not necessarily relate to the dust grains\nin a similar way. \n\n"}

Despite initial understandings of\natmospheric dynamics which is the major cause of the variability by previous\nstudies, the detailed mechanism of variability remains elusive, and we need to\nseek a natural, self-consistent mechanism. Clouds are important in shaping the\nthermal structure and spectral properties of these atmospheres via large\nopacity, and we expect the same for inducing atmospheric variability. In this\nwork, using a time-dependent one-dimensional model that incorporates a\nself-consistent coupling between the thermal structure, convective mixing,\ncloud radiative heating/cooling and condensation/evaporation of clouds, we show\nthat radiative cloud feedback can drive spontaneous atmospheric variability in\nboth temperature and cloud structure in conditions appropriate for BDs and\ndirectly imaged EGPs.

Following this\nevidence, we explore HCN towards IRAS 16293-2422, which we consider a solar\nanalog. Towards IRAS 16293-2422, we have reduced and analyzed Herschel spectra\nof HCN, and fit these observations against \"jump\" abundance models of IRAS\n16293-2422's protostellar envelope.

Here\nwe extend these 2D simulations to three dimensions (3D) and find that rings and\ngaps are still formed in the presence of a moderately strong ambipolar\ndiffusion. The rings and gaps form from the same basic mechanism that was\nidentified in the 2D simulations, namely, the redistribution of the poloidal\nmagnetic flux relative to the disk material as a result of the reconnection of\na sharply pinched poloidal magnetic field lines. Thus, the less dense gaps are\nmore strongly magnetized with a large poloidal magnetic field compared to the\nless magnetized (dense) rings. The rings and gaps start out rather smoothly in\n3D simulations that have axisymmetric initial conditions. Non-axisymmetric\nvariations arise spontaneously at later times, but they do not grow to such an\nextent as to disrupt the rings and gaps. These disk substructures persist to\nthe end of the simulations, lasting up to 3000 orbital periods at the inner\nedge of the simulated disk. The longevity of the perturbed yet still coherent\nrings make them attractive sites for trapping large grains that would otherwise\nbe lost to rapid radial migration due to gas drag. As the ambipolar diffusivity\ndecreases, both the disk and the wind become increasingly turbulent, driven by\nthe magnetorotational instability, with tightly-wound spiral arms becoming more\nprominent in the disk. \n\n"}

Morphologically, the SiO appears to represent a disc-like structure.\nUsing parametric models we show that the position-velocity profile of the SiO\nis consistent with the Keplerian rotation of a disc around an object between\n10-30Mo in mass, only if there is also radial expansion from a separate\nstructure. The radial motion component can be interpreted as a disc wind from\nthe disc surface.

The robustness of our member selection is reinforced by the fact that\nthe sources depict an almost noiseless, coeval stellar main sequence in the\nobservational Hertzsprung-Russel diagram. The spatial arrangement of the\nselected members represents a highly flattened shape with respect to the\ndirection of movement along the clusters' orbit in the Galaxy. The size of the\nentire structure, within the limits of the observations, measures about 200 pc\nin its largest extent, while being only about 25 pc thick.

We address this question by studying\nsystems formed by a solar-like star and a close-in planet. We focus on the\nstellar wind spinning down the star along its main sequence phase and tidal\ninteraction causing orbital evolution of the systems. Despite recent\nsignificant advances in these fields, all current models use parametric\ndescriptions to study at least one of these effects. Our objective is to\nintroduce simultaneously ab-initio prescriptions of the tidal and braking\ntorques, so as to improve our understanding of the underlying physics. We\ndevelop a 1D numerical model of coplanar circular star-planet systems taking\ninto account stellar structural changes, wind braking and tidal interaction and\nimplement it in a code called ESPEM. We follow the secular evolution of the\nstellar rotation assuming a bi-layer internal structure, and of the semi-major\naxis of the orbit. After comparing our predictions to recent observations and\nmodels, we perform tests to emphasize the contribution of ab-initio\nprescriptions. Our secular model of stellar wind braking reproduces well the\nrecent observations of stellar rotation in open clusters. Our results show that\na planet can affect the rotation of its host star and that the resulting\nspin-up or spin-down depends on the orbital semi-major axis and on the joint\ninfluence of magnetic and tidal effects.

The Large-Scale Structure\n  and Dynamics of Filamentary Molecular Clouds Abstract: We perform ideal MHD high resolution AMR simulations with driven turbulence\nand self-gravity and find that long filamentary molecular clouds are formed at\nthe converging locations of large-scale turbulence flows and the filaments are\nbounded by gravity. The magnetic field helps shape and reinforce the long\nfilamentary structures. The main filamentary cloud has a length of ~4.4 pc.\nInstead of a monolithic cylindrical structure, the main cloud is shown to be a\ncollection of fiber/web-like sub-structures similar to filamentary clouds such\nas L1495. Unless the line-of-sight is close to the mean field direction, the\nlarge-scale magnetic field and striations in the simulation are found roughly\nperpendicular to the long axis of the main cloud, similar to 1495. This\nprovides strong support for a large-scale moderately strong magnetic field\nsurrounding L1495. We find that the projection effect from observations can\nlead to incorrect interpretations of the true three-dimensional physical shape,\nsize, and velocity structure of the clouds. Helical magnetic field structures\nfound around filamentary clouds that are interpreted from Zeeman observations\ncan be explained by a simple bending of the magnetic field that pierces through\nthe cloud. We demonstrate that two dark clouds form a T-shape configuration\nwhich are strikingly similar to the Infrared dark cloud SDC13 leading to the\ninterpretation that SDC13 results from a collision of two long filamentary\nclouds.

Recent stellar evolution models indicate\nthat radiative burning of C13 between thermal pulses in low-mass AGB stars may\nindeed provide the needed neutrons. Some mixing between the proton-rich\nenvelope and the carbon-rich core may lead to the production of C13. However,\nthe responsible physical mechanism is not yet unambiguously identified. We\npresent stellar model calculations with overshoot and rotation. Overshoot, with\na time-dependent and exponentially decaying efficiency, leads to a partial\nmixture of protons and C12 during the third dredge-up. According to the\ndepth-dependent ratio of protons and C12, a small C13-pocket forms underneath a\nN14-rich layer. Overshoot does not allow for any mixing during the interpulse\nphase. Rotation introduces mixing driven by large angular velocity gradients\nwhich form at the envelope-core interface in AGB stars, in particular after a\nthermal pulse. This leads to partial mixing after a pulse, as in the case of\novershoot. However, rotation continues to mix the region of the C13-pocket with\na diffusion coefficient of log D ~ 2...3 [cm**2 / s]. This does not only spread\nthe C13-pocket, but also the more massive N14-rich layer, and finally leads to\nmixture of both layers. By the time when the temperature there has risen to\nabout 9*10E7K and neutron production sets in, the N14 abundance exceeds the C13\nabundance by a factor of 5...10. We analyze the role of N14 as a neutron poison\nby considering the recycling of neutrons via N14(n,p)C14 and\nC12(p,gamma)N13(beta+)C13 qualitatively.

But it is frustrating that we have\nnot made any progress in identifying the dark matter, in contrary, we have\nsupplemented it by what we call the 'dark energy', a gravitationally and\nesthetically repulsive component which is even more mysterious than the dark\nmatter. We have no understanding about the origin of these two most abundant\nenergy components of the present Universe. \n\n"}

Our model is based on\nthe assumptions that quasar emission is triggered by galaxy mergers, and that\nthe black hole mass is proportional to a power-law in the circular velocity v\nof the host galactic halo. We assume that quasars shine at their Eddington\nluminosity over a time proportional to the mass ratio between the small and\nfinal galaxies in the merger. This simple model fits the quasar luminosity\nfunction at z~2-3, reproduces the normalization and logarithmic slope (beta\n-2.58) at z~4.3, explains the space density of bright SDSS quasars at z~6.0,\nreproduces the black hole - halo mass relation for dormant black holes in the\nlocal universe, and matches the estimated duty cycle of quasar activity (~10^7\nyears) in Lyman-break galaxies at z~3. Based on the derived luminosity function\nwe predict the resulting gravitational lensing rates for high redshift quasars.\nThe lens fractions in the SDSS samples are predicted to be ~2% at z~4.3 and\n~10% at z>5.7.

The jets fire episodically, but often enough that the cuspy\natmosphere does not move very far towards a cooling catastrophe in the\nintervals of jet inactivity. The ability of energy released on the sub-parsec\nscale of the BH to balance cooling on scales of several tens of kiloparsecs\narises through a combination of the temperature sensitivity of the accretion\nrate and the way in which the radius of jet disruption varies with ambient\ndensity. Accretion of hot gas does not significantly increase BH masses, which\nare determined by periods of rapid BH growth and star formation when cold gas\nis briefly abundant at the galactic centre. Hot gas does not accumulate in\nshallow potential wells. As the Universe ages, deeper wells form, and\neventually hot gas accumulates. This gas soon prevents the formation of further\nstars, since jets powered by the BH prevent it from cooling, and it mops up\nmost cold infalling gas before many stars can form. Thus BHs set the upper\nlimit to the masses of galaxies. The formation of low-mass galaxies is\ninhibited by a combination of photo-heating and supernova-driven galactic\nwinds.

Two experiments underway which are\nsensitive to a strangelet flux in the predicted range are briefly described.\nFinally it is summarized how strangelets circumvent the acceleration problem\nencountered by conventional candidates for ultra-high energy cosmic rays and\nmove the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff to energies well above the observed\nmaximum energies. \n\n"}

Using stellar masses determined from SED fitting\nto 0.3-8 micron photometry, we divide the sample into six bins in stellar mass,\nand construct six composite H-alpha+[NII] spectra from all of the objects in\neach bin. We estimate the mean oxygen abundance in each bin from the\n[NII]/H-alpha ratio, and find a monotonic increase in metallicity with\nincreasing stellar mass, from 12+log(O/H) < 8.2 for galaxies with <M_star> =\n2.7e9 Msun to 12+log(O/H) = 8.6 for galaxies with <M_star> = 1e11 Msun. We use\nthe empirical relation between star formation rate density and gas density to\nestimate the gas fractions of the galaxies, finding an increase in gas fraction\nwith decreasing stellar mass. These gas fractions combined with the observed\nmetallicities allow the estimation of the effective yield y_eff as a function\nof stellar mass; in constrast to observations in the local universe which show\na decrease in y_eff with decreasing baryonic mass, we find a slight increase.\nSuch a variation of metallicity with gas fraction is best fit by a model with\nsupersolar yield and an outflow rate ~4 times higher than the star formation\nrate. We conclude that the mass-metallicity relation at high redshift is driven\nby the increase in metallicity as the gas fraction decreases through star\nformation, and is likely modulated by metal loss from strong outflows in\ngalaxies of all masses.

Abstract: We report the detection of the double neutron star binary (DNSB) B1534+12 (=\nJ1537+1155) with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. This DNSB (orbital period 10.1\nhr) consists of the millisecond (recycled) pulsar J1537+1155A (P_A=37.9 ms) and\na neutron star not detected in the radio. After the remarkable double pulsar\nbinary J0737-3039, it is the only other DNSB detected in X-rays. We measured\nthe flux of (2.2\\pm 0.6)\\times10^{-15} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the 0.3-6 keV\nband. The small number of collected counts allows only crude estimates of\nspectral parameters. The power-law fit yields the photon index of 3.2\\pm 0.5\nand the unabsorbed 0.2-10 keV luminosity L_X=6\\times10^{29} ergs s^{-1} =\n3\\times 10^{-4}Edot_A, where Edot_A is the spin-down power of J1537+1155A.\nAlternatively, the spectrum can be fitted by a blackbody model with T = 2.2 MK\nand the projected emitting area of ~ 5\\times 10^3 m^2. The distribution of\nphoton arrival times over binary orbital phase shows a deficit of X-ray\nemission around apastron, which suggests that the emission is caused by\ninteraction of the relativistic wind from J1537+1155A with its neutron star\ncompanion. We also reanalyzed the Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of\nJ0737-3039 and found that its X-ray spectrum is similar to the spectrum of\nB1534+12, and its X-ray luminosity is about the same fraction of Edot_A, which\nsuggests similar X-ray emission mechanisms. However, the X-ray emission from\nJ0737-3039 does not show orbital phase dependence. This difference can be\nexplained by the smaller eccentricity of J0737-3039 or a smaller misalignment\nbetween the equatorial plane of the millisecond pulsar and the orbital plane of\nthe binary. \n\n"}

Most of these unusual pulsars also\nappear to be associated with supernova shell remnants (SNRs) with typical ages\n<30 kyr.
