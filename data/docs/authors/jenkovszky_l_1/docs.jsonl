If correct, this\nimplies that mass generation mechanisms and physics in excited hadrons is very\ndifferent as compared to the lowest states. One needs an alternative and\nindependent experimental information to confirm this conjecture. Using very\ngeneral chiral symmetry arguments it is shown that strict chiral restoration in\na given excited nucleon forbids its decay into the N \\pi channel. Hence those\nexcited nucleons which are assumed from the spectroscopic patterns to be in\napproximate chiral multiplets must only \"weakly\" decay into the N \\pi channel,\n(f_{N^*N\\pi}/f_{NN\\pi})^2 << 1. However, those baryons which have no chiral\npartner must decay strongly with a decay constant comparable with f_{NN\\pi}.\nDecay constants can be extracted from the existing decay widths and branching\nratios. It turnes out that for all those well established excited nucleons\nwhich can be classified into chiral doublets N_+(1440) - N_-(1535), N_+(1710) -\nN_-(1650), N_+(1720) - N_-(1700), N_+(1680) - N_-(1675), N_+(2220) - N_-(2250),\nN_+(?) - N_-(2190), N_+(?) - N_-(2600), the ratio is (f_{N^*N\\pi}/f_{NN\\pi})^2\n~ 0.1 or much smaller for the high-spin states.

It is shown that the hydrodynamical\ndescription of the near quark region worsens with increasing quark velocities.\nFor realistic quark velocities, $v=0.99$, the non-hydrodynamical region is\nlocated at a narrow band surrounding the quark with a width of approximately\n$3/\\pi T$ in the direction parallel to the quark's motion and with a length of\nroughly $10/\\pi T$ in the perpendicular direction. Our results can be\ninterpreted as an indication of the presence of coherent Yang-Mills fields\nwhere deviation from hydrodynamics is at its maximum. In the region where\nhydrodynamics does provide a good description of the system's dynamics, the\nflow velocity is so small that all the nonlinear terms can be dropped. Our\nresults, which are compatible with the thermalization timescales extracted from\nelliptic flow measurements, suggest that if AdS/CFT provides a good description\nof the RHIC system, the bulk of the quenched jet energy has more than enough\ntime to locally thermalize and become encoded in the collective flow.

{"id": "0810.0713", "contents": "Title: A Theory of Dark Matter Abstract: We propose a comprehensive theory of dark matter that explains the recent\nproliferation of unexpected observations in high-energy astrophysics. Cosmic\nray spectra from ATIC and PAMELA require a WIMP with mass M_chi ~ 500 - 800 GeV\nthat annihilates into leptons at a level well above that expected from a\nthermal relic. Signals from WMAP and EGRET reinforce this interpretation. Taken\ntogether, we argue these facts imply the presence of a GeV-scale new force in\nthe dark sector. The long range allows a Sommerfeld enhancement to boost the\nannihilation cross section as required, without altering the weak scale\nannihilation cross section during dark matter freezeout in the early universe.\nIf the dark matter annihilates into the new force carrier, phi, its low mass\ncan force it to decay dominantly into leptons. If the force carrier is a\nnon-Abelian gauge boson, the dark matter is part of a multiplet of states, and\nsplittings between these states are naturally generated with size alpha m_phi ~\nMeV, leading to the eXciting dark matter (XDM) scenario previously proposed to\nexplain the positron annihilation in the galactic center observed by the\nINTEGRAL satellite. Somewhat smaller splittings would also be expected,\nproviding a natural source for the parameters of the inelastic dark matter\n(iDM) explanation for the DAMA annual modulation signal. Since the Sommerfeld\nenhancement is most significant at low velocities, early dark matter halos at\nredshift ~10 potentially produce observable effects on the ionization history\nof the universe, and substructure is more detectable than with a conventional\nWIMP. Moreover, the low velocity dispersion of dwarf galaxies and Milky Way\nsubhalos can greatly increase the substructure annihilation signal. \n\n"}
{"id": "0810.0714", "contents": "Title: LHC Signals for a SuperUnified Theory of Dark Matter Abstract: A new theory of WIMP Dark Matter has been proposed, motivated directly by\nstriking Data from the PAMELA and ATIC collaborations. The WIMP is taken to be\ncharged under a hidden gauge symmetry G_Dark, broken near the GeV scale; this\nalso provides the necessary ingredients for the \"exciting\" and \"inelastic\" Dark\nMatter interpretations of the INTEGRAL and DAMA signals. In this short note we\npoint out the consequences of the most straightforward embedding of this simple\npicture within low-energy SUSY, in which G_Dark breaking at the GeV scale\narises naturally through radiative corrections, or Planck-suppressed operators.\nThe theory predicts major additions to SUSY signals at the LHC. A completely\ngeneric prediction is that G_Dark particles can be produced in cascade decays\nof MSSM superpartners, since these end with pairs of MSSM LSP's that in turn\ndecay into the true LSP and other particles in the dark sector. In turn, the\nlightest GeV-scale dark Higgses and gauge bosons eventually decay back into\nlight SM states, and dominantly into leptons. Therefore, a large fraction of\nall SUSY events will contain at least two ``lepton jets'': collections of n>= 2\nleptons, with small angular separations and GeV scale invariant masses.\nFurthermore, if the Dark Matter sector is directly charged under the Standard\nModel, the success of gauge coupling unification implies the presence of new\nlong-lived colored particles that can be copiously produced at the LHC. \n\n"}

Namely, we\nconsider the cases with superWIMP (gravitino or axino) and neutralino dark\nmatter (along the coannihilation region). In both scenarios the maximum value\nof the stau flux turns out to be about 1 event/yr in regions with a light stau.\nThis is consistent with light gravitinos, with masses constrained by an upper\nlimit which ranges from 0.2 to 15 GeV, depending on the stau mass.

The dark matter is (mainly) the neutral W boson\nsuperpartner, the wino with mass below 200 GeV. Using the program GALPROP we\nstudy the annihilation products and backgrounds together. Antimatter and gammas\nfrom annihilating winos contribute below this energy. We explain why PAMELA\ndata does not imply no antiproton signal was observed by PAMELA or earlier\nexperiments, and explain why the antiproton analysis was misunderstood by\nearlier papers. Wino annihilation does not describe the Fermi e+ + e- data\n(except partially below ~ 100 GeV).

Motivated by data\nwhich suggests that the strong coupling \\alpha_s(Q) freezes at low Q, and by\nsimilarities between the spectra of hadrons and atoms, I discuss if and how QCD\nbound states may be treated perturbatively. I recall the basic principles of\nperturbative gauge theory bound states at lowest order in the \\hbar expansion.\nBorn level amplitudes are insensitive to the i\\epsilon prescription of\npropagators, which allows to eliminate the Z-diagrams of relativistic,\ntime-ordered Coulomb interactions. The Dirac wave function thus describes a\nsingle electron which propagates forward in time only, even though the bound\nstate has any number of pair constituents when Feynman propagators are used. In\nthe absence of an external potential, states that are bound by the Coulomb\nattraction of their constituents can be analogously described using only their\nvalence degrees of freedom. The instantaneous A^0 field is determined by Gauss'\nlaw for each wave function component, i.e., for each position of the valence\nconstituents. Solutions for A^0 obtained with a boundary condition that imposes\nan asymptotically constant energy density give rise to a linear potential for\ncolor singlet q\\bar q and qqq states. The strength of the linear potential is\ndetermined by the boundary condition and is of lower order in \\alpha_s than the\ngluon exchange interaction, which may then be treated as a higher order\nperturbative correction. Bound states evaluated to a given order in \\alpha_s\nand \\hbar must have the full symmetry of the exact theory, including the\ndynamic boost invariance of states quantized at equal time. The wave functions\nare indeed found to have such a hidden invariance, which ensures the correct\ndependence of the energy eigenvalues on the center of mass momentum.

This DM mass scale (warm DM) is in agreement with both\ncosmological and galactic observations. We study the role of a keV sterile\nneutrino through its mixing with a light active neutrino in Rhenium 187 and\nTritium beta decays. We pinpoint the energy spectrum of the beta particle, 0 <\nT_e < (Q_{beta} - m_s), as the region where a sterile neutrino could be\ndetected and where its mass m_s could be measured. This energy region is at\nleast 1 keV away rom the region suitable to measure the mass of the light\nactive neutrino, located near the endpoint Q_{beta} . The emission of a keV\nsterile neutrino in a beta decay could show up as a small kink in the spectrum\nof the emitted beta particle. With this in view, we perform a careful\ncalculation of the Rhenium and Tritium beta spectra and estimate the size of\nthis perturbation by means of the dimensionless ratio R of the sterile neutrino\nto the active neutrino contributions. We comment on the possibility of\nsearching for sterile neutrino signatures in two experiments which are\ncurrently running at present, MARE and KATRIN, focused on the Rhenium 187 and\nTritium beta decays respectively. \n\n"}

It is pointed\nout that under this framework, a certain structure is anticipated in the cross\nsection expression for a `double perturbative splitting' diagram, which in the\nframework is regarded as DPS.

First, we obtain the\ngeneral system of equations and apply them to some abstract systems of\ngalaxies. Then we investigate the collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda\nin future. We distinguish two models. For the first one, we do not take into\naccount the influence of Intra-Group Matter (IGrM). In this case we demonstrate\nthat for currently known parameters of this system the collision is hardly\nplausible because of the angular momentum. These galaxies will approach the\nminimum distance of about 290 Kpc in 4.44 Gyr from present and then begin to\nrun away irreversibly from each other. For the second model, we take into\naccount dynamical friction due to IGrM. We find a characteristic value of the\nIGrM particle velocity dispersion $\\tilde\\sigma=2.306$. For\n$\\tilde\\sigma\\leq2.306$ the merger will take place, but for the bigger values\nof $\\tilde\\sigma$ the merger can be problematic. If the temperature of the IGrM\nparticles is $10^5$ K, this characteristic value of $\\tilde\\sigma$ corresponds\nto the IGrM particle mass 17 MeV. Therefore, for the IGrM particles with masses\nless than 17 MeV the merger becomes problematic.

For\nsuch processes the zero-acceleration surface (where gravitational attraction is\nbalanced by cosmological accelerated expansion) plays the crucial role. We show\nthat such surface is absent for the Local Group. Instead, we find two points\nand one circle with zero acceleration.

Arbitrary models with any number of Higgs\nbosons can be investigated using a model-independent input scheme based on\nHiggsBounds. The test is based on the calculation of a chi-squared measure from\nthe predictions and the measured Higgs rates and masses, with the ability of\nfully taking into account systematics and correlations for the signal rate\npredictions, luminosity and Higgs mass predictions. It features two\ncomplementary methods for the test. First, the peak-centered method, in which\neach observable is defined by a Higgs signal rate measured at a specific\nhypothetical Higgs mass, corresponding to a tentative Higgs signal. Second, the\nmass-centered method, where the test is evaluated by comparing the signal rate\nmeasurement to the theory prediction at the Higgs mass predicted by the model.\nThe program allows for the simultaneous use of both methods, which is useful in\ntesting models with multiple Higgs bosons. The code automatically combines the\nsignal rates of multiple Higgs bosons if their signals cannot be resolved by\nthe experimental analysis.

For large times the energy spread is, as expected,\ngiven by the decay width $\\Gamma$ of the initial unstable state. However, if\nthe measurement of the final state is performed at a time $t$ comparable to (or\nsmaller than) the mean lifetime of the state $1/\\Gamma$, then the uncertainty\non the energy of the final state is much larger than the decay width $\\Gamma$.\nNamely, for short times an uncertainty of the type $1/t$ dominates, while at\nlarge times the usual spread $\\Gamma$ is recovered.

The divergence has got us into trouble since developing\nquantum electrodynamics in 1930s, its treatment via the renormalization scheme\nis satisfied not by all physicists, like Dirac and Feynman who have made\nserious criticisms. The renormalization group analysis reveals that QFTs can in\ngeneral be defined fundamentally with the meaningful energy scale that has some\nphysical significance, which motivates us to develop a new symmetry-preserving\nand infinity-free regularization scheme called loop regularization (LORE). A\nsimple regularization prescription in LORE is realized based on a manifest\npostulation that a loop divergence with a power counting dimension larger than\nor equal to the space-time dimension must vanish. The LORE method is achieved\nwithout modifying original theory and leads the divergent Feynman loop\nintegrals well-defined to maintain the divergence structure and meanwhile\npreserve basic symmetries of original theory. The crucial point in LORE is the\npresence of two intrinsic energy scales which play the roles of ultraviolet\ncut-off $M_c$ and infrared cut-off $\\mu_s$ to avoid infinities. The key concept\nin LORE is the introduction of irreducible loop integrals (ILIs) on which the\nregularization prescription acts, which leads to a set of gauge invariance\nconsistency conditions between the regularized tensor-type and scalar-type\nILIs. The evaluation of ILIs with ultraviolet-divergence-preserving (UVDP)\nparametrization naturally leads to Bjorken-Drell's analogy between Feynman\ndiagrams and electric circuits.

Recently, a\ntheoretically consistent picture of open heavy flavor production in ultra\nrelativistic nuclear collisions has begun to emerge based on effective theories\nof QCD, such as soft collinear effective theory with Glauber gluons. We show\nthat implementation of in-medium splitting processes containing heavy quarks\ninto next-to-leading order calculations of heavy flavor production leads to\nlarger cross section suppression when compared to traditional energy loss\nphenomenology. To better constrain the important mass dependence of in-medium\nsplitting functions, we propose a new measurement in relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions, based on a two-prong structure inside a reconstructed heavy flavor\njet. In the region of jet transverse momenta where parton mass effects are\nleading, we predict a unique reversal of the mass hierarchy of jet quenching\neffects in heavy ion relative to proton collisions. We find that the momentum\nsharing distribution of prompt $b$-tagged jets is more strongly modified in\ncomparison to the one for light jets.

The logarithmic density\nslopes gamma = d(log rho)/d(log r) of the LCDM halos are found to vary as\npower-laws in radius, reaching values of gamma ~ -1 at the innermost resolved\nradii (~0.01 r_virial).

The\npomeron, in first approximation, is a single reggeized gluon plus a ``wee\nparton'' component that compensates for the color and particle properties of\nthe gluon. This solution corresponds to a supercritical phase of Reggeon Field\nTheory.\n  Beginning with the multi-regge behavior of massive quark and gluon\namplitudes, reggeon unitarity is used to derive a reggeon diagram description\nof a wide class of multi-regge amplitudes, including those describing the\nformation and scattering of bound-state Regge poles.

The advantages\nof this three-family universality of $U(1)_A$, compared to the two-family case,\nproposed in earlier works, in yielding squark degeneracy, while avoiding\nradiative breaking of color and charge, are noted.

I decided to put it to hep-th,\nto make it easily available. Many things happened during the 15 years since the\ntime when it was written. In particular, we have learned a lot about the high\ntemperature behavior in the electroweak theory and about baryogenesis. A\ndiscovery of the acceleration of the universe has changed the way we are\nthinking about the problem of the vacuum energy: Instead of trying to explain\nwhy it is zero, we are trying to understand why it is anomalously small. Recent\ncosmological observations have shown that the universe is flat, or almost\nexactly flat, and confirmed many other predictions of inflationary theory. Many\nnew versions of this theory have been developed, including hybrid inflation and\ninflationary models based on string theory. There was a substantial progress in\nthe theory of reheating of the universe after inflation, and in the theory of\neternal inflation. It's clear, therefore, that some parts of the book should be\nupdated, which I might do sometimes in the future. I hope, however, that this\nbook may be of some interest even in its original form.

In contrast to recent attempts to realize scalar field\ninflation without potentials (such as k-inflation or ghost inflation), we find\nthat it is possible to obtain exponential inflation, without invoking any\nhigher derivative actions, or modifying gravity, and that unlike all previous\napproaches, we do not require a $\\rho = -p$ phase in order to realize\ninflation. The inflaton in our proposed framework is a scalar field with a\nquadratic kinetic energy term, but with the `wrong sign'. We take the\nperspective that this is due to some temporary instability in our system at\nhigh energies, and provide physical examples of situations where a modulus\nfield might temprorarily exhibit such behaviour. The deflation of extra\ndimensions is a neccesary feature of our framework.
