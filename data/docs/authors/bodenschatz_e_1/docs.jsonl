This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude\nLANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow. \n\n"}

The cylinders are electrically connected\nthrough a remote, perfectly conducting endcap, which allows a radial electric\ncurrent to pass through the liquid. The radial current interacting with the\naxial component of magnetic field gives rise to the azimuthal electromagnetic\nforce, which destabilizes the base flow by making its angular momentum decrease\nradially outwards. This instability, which we refer to as the\npseudo--magnetorotational instability (MRI), looks like an MRI although its\nmechanism is basically centrifugal. In a helical magnetic field, the radial\ncurrent interacting with the azimuthal component of the field gives rise to an\naxial electromagnetic force, which drives a longitudinal circulation. First,\nthis circulation advects the Taylor vortices generated by the centrifugal\ninstability, which results in a traveling wave as in the helical MRI (HMRI).\nHowever, the direction of travel of this wave is opposite to that of the true\nHMRI. Second, at sufficiently strong differential rotation, the longitudinal\nflow becomes hydrodynamically unstable itself. For electrically connected\ncylinders in a helical magnetic field, hydrodynamic instability is possible at\nany sufficiently strong differential rotation.

Relatively large biases are present\nfor most CMs when global energy budgets and when the atmospheric, oceanic, and\nland budgets are considered. Apparently, the biases do not result from\ntransient effects, but depend on the imperfect closure of the energy cycle in\nthe fluid components and on inconsistencies over land. Therefore, the planetary\nemission temperature is underestimated. This may explain the CMs' cold bias. In\nthe pre-industrial scenario, CMs agree on the location in the mid-latitudes of\nthe peaks of the meridional atmospheric enthalpy transport, while large\ndiscrepancies exist on the intensity. Disagreements on the location and\nintensity of the oceanic transport peaks are serious. With increased $CO_2$\nconcentration, a small poleward shift of the peak and an increase in the\nintensity of the atmospheric transport of up to 10% are detected in both\nhemispheres. Instead, most CMs feature a decrease in the oceanic transport\nintensity in the northern hemisphere and an equatorward shift of the peak in\nboth hemispheres.

As a consequence, the\ncoarse-grained vorticity field can be predicted through standard statistical\nmechanics arguments (relying on the Hamiltonian structure of the\ntwo-dimensional Euler flow), for any given set of the integral constraints.\n  It has been suggested that the theory applies equally well to geophysical\nturbulence; specifically in the case of the quasi-geostrophic equations, with\npotential vorticity playing the role of the advected quantity. In this study,\nwe demonstrate analytically that the Miller-Robert-Sommeria theory leads to\nnon-trivial statistical equilibria for quasi-geostrophic flows on a rotating\nsphere, with or without bottom topography. We first consider flows without\nbottom topography and with an infinite Rossby deformation radius, with and\nwithout conservation of angular momentum.

Two cases are considered. The first one is the\ncounterflowing (Vinen) turbulence, where the vortex lines are disordered, and\nthe evolution of quantity $\\mathcal{L}(t)$ obeys the Vinen equation. The second\ncase is the quasi-classic turbulence, where vortex lines are believed to form\nthe so called vortex bundles, and their dynamics is described by the HVBK\nequations. The latter case, is of a special interest, since a number of recent\nexperiments demonstrate the $\\omega ^{-5/3}$ dependence for spectrum VLD,\ninstead of $\\omega ^{1/3}$ law, typical for spectrum of vorticity. In\nnonstationary situation, in particular, in the fluctuating turbulent flow there\nis a retardation between the instantaneous value of the normal velocity and the\nquantity $\\mathcal{L}$. This retardation tends to decrease in the accordance\nwith the inner dynamics, which has a relaxation character.

When using a more reliable hydrodynamical\nmodel, the dispersion relation does not present any maximum of the growth rate\nwhen the sediment transport is assumed to be locally saturated. The analysis\ntherefore reveals the fundamental importance of the relaxation of sediment\ntransport towards equilibrium as it it is responsible for the stabilisation of\nsmall wavelength modes. This dynamical mechanism is characterised by the\nsaturation number, defined as the ratio of the saturation length to the water\ndepth Lsat/H. This dimensionless number controls the transition from ripples\n(transverse patterns) at small Lsat/H to bars (inclined patterns) at large\nLsat/H. At a given value of the saturation number, the instability presents a\nthreshold and a convective-absolute transition, both controlled by the channel\naspect ratio {\\beta}. We have investigated the characteristics of the most\nunstable mode as a function of the main parameters, Lsat/H, {\\beta} and of a\nsubdominant parameter controlling the relative influence of drag and gravity on\nsediment transport. As previously found, the transition from alternate bars to\nmultiple bars is mostly controlled by the river aspect ratio {\\beta}. By\ncontrast, in the alternate bar regime (large Lsat/H), the selected wavelength\ndoes not depend much on {\\beta} and approximately scales as H^(2/3)L^(1/3)/C,\nwhere C is the Ch\\'ezy number. \n\n"}

A particularly simple and\nelegant model of wave-pinning has been proposed by Edelstein-Keshet and\ncoworkers (Biop. J., 2008). However, biomolecular networks do communicate with\nother networks as well as with the external world. As such, their dynamics has\nto be considered as perturbed by extrinsic noises.

Low Mach numbers may in particular lead to the\nwell-known, incompressible Kolmogorov turbulence, while for high Mach numbers,\nwe are in the highly compressible regime, thus close to Burgers turbulence. In\nthis study, we explore whether in this large range of conditions, a universal\nbehavior can be expected. Our starting point are previous investigations in the\nkinematic regime.

The investigation of\nthe solid-fluid transition in a rheometric flow in the presence and in the ab-\nsence of the wall slip reveals a coupling between the irreversible deformation\nstates and the wall slip phenomenon. Particularly, the presence of wall slip\nnearly suppresses the scaling of the deformation power deficit associated to\nthe rheological hysteresis with the rate at which the material is forced. The\nirreversible solid-fluid transition and the wall slip behaviour emerge in the\nsame range of the applied stresses and thus, the two phenomena appear to be\ncoupled to each other. In-situ measurements of the flow fields performed during\nan increasing/decreasing stepped pressure ramp reveal three distinct flow\nregimes: solid (pluglike), solid-fluid and fluid. The deformation power deficit\nassociated with the hysteresis observed during the increasing/decreasing\nbranches of the pressure ramps reveals a dependence on the rate at which the\nunsteady flow is driven consistent with that observed during the rheological\nmeasurements in the presence of slip. The dependence of the slip velocity on\nthe wall shear stresses reveals a Navier-type slip behaviour only within the\nfluid flow regime, which indicates that the wall slip phenomenon is directly\ncoupled to the solid-fluid transition.

To leading order, the relationship between the\nvorticity and the stream function at equilibrium is linear and the maximization\nof the entropy becomes equivalent to the minimization of the enstrophy. This\nexpansion is similar to the Debye-H\\\"uckel approximation for electrolytes,\nexcept that the temperature is negative instead of positive so that the\neffective interaction between like-sign vortices is attractive instead of\nrepulsive.

To determine the collision rate, many\nnumerical studies rely on the 'Ghost Collision Approximation' (GCA), which\nsimply records how often pairs of point particles come within a threshold\ndistance. In many applications, the suspended particles stick (or in the case\nof liquid droplets, coalesce) upon collision, and it is the frequency of first\ncontact which is of interest. If a pair of 'ghost' particles undergoes multiple\ncollisions, the GCA may overestimate the true collision rate. Here, using fully\nresolved Direct Numerical Simulations of turbulent flows at moderate Reynolds\nnumber (R_\\lambda = 130), we investigate the prevalence and properties of\nmultiple collisions. We demonstrate that the GCA leads to a systematic\noverestimate of the collision rate, which is of the order of 15% when the\nparticle inertia is small, and slowly decreases when inertia increases.

This work provides a systematic and unified approach for estimating\nthese errors. First, a sampling error estimator that accounts for correlation\nin the input data is developed. Then, this sampling error estimate is used as\npart of a Bayesian extension of Richardson extrapolation in order to\ncharacterize the discretization error.

The shocked region near the contact\nsurface has a planar symmetry and a uniform pressure. The density vanishes at\nthe (Lagrangian) surface of contact and the speed of sound diverges there.

Here, we explore the possibility that the interplay of planetary\nrotation with the compression and expansion of the convecting fluid can drive\nmultiple deep zonal jets by a compressional Rhines-type mechanism, as\noriginally proposed by Ingersoll and Pollard (1982). In a certain limit, this\ndeep mechanism is shown to be mathematically analogous to the classical Rhines\nmechanism possibly operating at cloud level. Jets are predicted to occur on a\ncompressional Rhines length $l_R = (2 \\Omega \\langle H_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle\nv_{jet}^{-1} )^{-1/2}$, where $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity, $\\langle\nH_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle$ is the mean inverse density scale height and $v_{jet}$ is\nthe typical jet velocity.

Furthermore,\n$\\rho_{cr}$ is critical in the sense that there is no such subsonic flow if the\ndensity of the incoming flow is less than $\\rho_{cr}$. The subsonic flows\npossess large vorticity and positive horizontal velocity above the wall except\nat the corner points on the boundary. Moreover, the existence and uniqueness of\na two dimensional subsonic Euler flow past a symmetric body are also obtained\nwhen the incoming velocity field is a general small perturbation of a constant\nvelocity field and the density of the incoming flow is larger than a critical\nvalue. The asymptotic behavior of the flows is obtained with the aid of some\nintegral estimates for the velocity field and its far field states. \n\n"}

For\nviscous-dominated flows, such as flows at small scales, we develop a scheme for\nintegrating the overdamped limit of the low Mach equations, in which inertia\nvanishes and the fluid motion can be described by a steady Stokes equation.

The\ncorresponding near-inertial waves (NIWs) are highly energetic and play a\nsignificant role in the slow, large-scale dynamics of the ocean. To analyse\nthis role, we develop a new model of the nondissipative interactions between\nNIWs and balanced motion. The model is derived using the\ngeneralised-Lagrangian-mean (GLM) framework (specifically, the glm variant of\nSoward & Roberts (2010)), taking advantage of the time-scale separation between\nthe two types of motion to average over the short NIW period.\n  We combine Salmon's (2013) variational formulation of GLM with Whitham\naveraging to obtain a system of equations governing the joint evolution of NIWs\nand mean flow. Assuming that the mean flow is geostrophically balanced reduces\nthis system to a simple model coupling Young & Ben Jelloul's (1997) equation\nfor NIWs with a modified quasi-geostrophic equation. In this coupled model, the\nmean flow affects the NIWs through advection and refraction; conversely, the\nNIWs affect the mean flow by modifying the potential-vorticity inversion - the\nrelation between advected potential vorticity and advecting mean velocity -\nthrough a quadratic wave term, consistent with the GLM results of Bu\u007fhler &\nMcIntyre (1998).\n  The coupled model is Hamiltonian and its conservation laws, for wave action\nand energy in particular, prove illuminating: on their basis, we identify a new\ninteraction mechanism whereby NIWs forced at large scales extract energy from\nthe balanced flow as their horizontal scale is reduced by differential\nadvection and refraction so that their potential energy increases.

In such situations, truncations of the hierarchy of cumulant\nequations hold promise as a closure strategy.\n  We review how truncations at second order can be used to model and elucidate\nthe dynamics of atmospheric flows. Two examples are considered. First, we study\nthe growth of a dry convective boundary layer, which is heated from below,\nleading to turbulent upward energy transport and growth of the boundary layer.\nWe demonstrate that a quasilinear truncation of the equations of motion, in\nwhich interactions of disturbances among each other are neglected but\ninteractions with mean fields are taken into account, can capture the growth of\nthe convective boundary layer even if it does not capture important turbulent\ntransport terms. Second, we study the evolution of two-dimensional large-scale\nwaves representing waves in Earth's upper atmosphere. We demonstrate that a\ncumulant expansion truncated at second order (CE2) can capture the evolution of\nsuch waves and their nonlinear interaction with the mean flow in some\ncircumstances, for example, when the wave amplitude is small enough or the\nplanetary rotation rate is large enough.

As the consideration of the Navier-Stokes equations is given\nin a cylindrical co-ordinates system, two aspects of complication arise. One is\nthe interaction of the velocity components in the radial and azimuthal\ndirections, due to the fictitious centrifugal force in the equations of motion.\nThe rate of the vorticity production at the pipe wall depends on the initial\ndata at entry, and hence is unknown a priori; it must be determined as part of\nthe solution. The vorticity solution obtained defines an intricate flow-field\nof multitudinous degrees of freedom.

It\nshows that in SFT the temperature spectrum follows the k^-5/3 power law, and\nthe temperature field has \"ramp-cliff\" structures. By contrast, in CFT the\ntemperature spectrum obeys the k^-2 power law, and the temperature field is\ndominated by large-scale rarefaction and compression. The power-law exponents\nfor the p.d.f. of large negative dilatation are -2.5 in SFT and -3.5 in CFT,\nclose to theoretical values. For the isentropic assumption of thermodynamic\nvariables, the derivation in SFT grows with the turbulent Mach number (Mt), and\nfor same Mt, the variables in CFT are more anisentropic. The angle statistics\nshows that the temperature gradient in CFT is preferentially perpendicular to\nthe anisotropic strain rate tensor.

Covariant Lyapunov Vectors (CLVs)\noffer a suitable characterization of the linear stability of a chaotic flow,\nsince they represent the full tangent linear dynamics by a covariant basis\nwhich explores linear perturbations at all time scales. Therefore, we assess\nwhether CLVs feature a signature of the blockings. As a first step, we examine\nthe CLVs for a quasi-geostrophic beta-plane 2-layer model in a periodic channel\nbaroclinically driven by a meridional temperature gradient $\\Delta T$. An\norographic forcing enhances the emergence of localized blocked regimes. We\ndetect the blocking events with a Tibaldi-Molteni scheme adapted to the\nperiodic channel. When blocking occurs, the global growth rates of the fastest\ngrowing CLVs are significantly higher. Hence, against intuition, the\ncirculation is globally more unstable in blocked phases. Such an increase in\nthe finite time Lyapunov exponents with respect to the long term average is\nattributed to stronger barotropic and baroclinic conversion in the case of high\ntemperature gradients, while for low values of \\Delta T, the effect is only due\nto stronger barotropic instability.

In this way we can vary the degree of turbulence helicity from non\nhelical to maximally helical. We find that increasing the rate of helicity\ninjection does not change the energy flux. On the other hand the level of total\nenergy is strongly increased and the energy spectrum gets steeper. The energy\nspectrum spans from a Kolmogorov scaling law $k^{-5/3}$ for a non-helical\nturbulence, to a non-Kolmogorov scaling law $k^{-7/3}$ for a maximally helical\nturbulence. In the later case we find that the characteristic time of the\nturbulence is not the turnover time but a time based on the helicity injection\nrate.

Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors. \n\n"}

Except for the\nlongest molecule studied, C60, the invasion kinetics can be described by bulk\nfluidity and bulk capillarity, provided we assume a sticking, pore-wall\nadsorbed boundary layer, i.e. a monolayer of water covered by a monolayer of\nflat-laying hydrocarbons. For C60, however, an enhanced imbibition speed\ncompared to the value expected in the bulk is found. This suggests the onset of\nvelocity slippage at the silica walls or a reduced shear viscosity due to the\ntransition towards a polymer-like flow in confined geometries. Both, light\nscattering and neutron imaging indicate a pronounced roughening of the\nimbibition fronts. Their overall shape and width can be resolved by neutron\nimaging.

By\nconsidering an inhomogeneous mean flow effect on turbulence, it is shown that\nturbulent cross helicity (velocity--magnetic-field correlation) should enter\nthe expression of turbulent electromotive force as the coupling coefficient for\nthe mean absolute vorticity. The inclusion of the cross-helicity effect makes\nthe present model different from the current $\\alpha$--$\\Omega$-type models\nmainly in two points. First, in addition to the usual $\\alpha$ (helicity\neffect) and $\\beta$ (turbulent magnetic diffusivity), we consider the $\\gamma$\ncoefficient (cross-helicity effect) as a key ingredient of the dynamo process.\nSecond, unlike the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ coefficients, which are often treated\nas an adjustable parameter in the current studies, the spatiotemporal evolution\nof $\\gamma$ coefficient is solved simultaneously with the mean magnetic-field\nequations. The basic scenario is as follows: In the presence of turbulent cross\nhelicity, the toroidal field is induced by the toroidal rotation in mediation\nby the turbulent cross helicity. The $\\alpha$ effect generates the poloidal\nfield from the toroidal one. This poloidal field produces a turbulent cross\nhelicity whose sign is opposite to the original one.

In order to take into account the thixotropy,\nthe constitutive relation uses a structural parameter which is driven by a\nkinetic equation. Here, the Houska's model is considered. Depending on the\nbreakdown rate of the structural parameter, localization or shear-banding are\nobserved. We show that for fragile structures, a shear-banding flow may be\nobserved although for stronger structures, only localisation of the flow is\nobserved such as in Bingham fluids. Physical explanations of the shear-banding\ndiscussed by several authors in the literature highlight that the shear-banding\nmay be associated with a discontinuity into the structure of the material and a\nnon-monotonic evolution of the stress according to the constitutive relation\nwith the strain rate. Solving numerically the flow, we show that such a\nrheological model based on the existence of a structural parameter is able to\npredict shear-banding. Moreover, the consequences of the thixotropy on the\nlinear stability of the azimuthal flow is studied in a large range of\nparameters. Although the thixotropy allows shear banding for the base flow, it\ndoes not modify fundamentaly the stability of the Couette flow compared to a\nsimple yield stress fluid. The apparent shear-thinning behaviour depends on the\nthixotropic parameters of the fluid and the results about the onset of the\nTaylor vortices in shear-thinning fluids are retrieved. Nevertheless, the\nshear-banding modifies the stratification of the viscosity in the flowing zone\nsuch that the critical conditions are mainly driven by the width of the flowing\nregion. \n\n"}

The usual interpretation\nof the Koopman operator is generalised to permit combinations of such\noperations, in addition to translation in time.

The archetypical\ncases of Poiseuille pipe flow and plane Couette flow are first reviewed at the\nphenomenological level, together with a few other flow configurations.\nTheoretical approaches are then examined with particular emphasis on the\nexistence of special nontrivial solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations at\nfinite distance from laminar flow. Dynamical systems theory is most appropriate\nto analyze their role, in particular with respect to the transient character of\nturbulence in the lower transitional range.

The important similarities\ninclude basic equations, ideal quadratic invariants, cascades and the role of\nlinear elastic waves. Surface tension induces elasticity, and the balance\nbetween surface tension energy and turbulent kinetic energy determines a length\nscale (Hinze scale) of the system. The Hinze scale may be thought of as the\nscale of emergent critical balance between fluid straining and elastic\nrestoring forces. The scales between the Hinze scale and dissipation scale\nconstitute the elastic range of the 2D CHNS system. By direct numerical\nsimulation, we find that in the elastic range, the mean square concentration\nspectrum $H^\\psi_k$ of the 2D CHNS system exhibits the same power law ($-7/3$)\nas the mean square magnetic potential spectrum $H^A_k$ in the inverse cascade\nregime of 2D MHD.

Standard RANS simulations are performed\non a 3:2 elliptic nose and NACA0020 tail cylinder joined at their maximum\nthickness location. Current results show that both the posterior mean velocity\nand the Reynolds stress anisotropy show better agreement with the experimental\ndata at the corner region near the trailing edge. On the other hand, the prior\nvelocity profiles at the leading edge indicate the restriction of uncertainty\nspace and the performance of the framework at this region is less effective. By\nperturbing the orientation of Reynolds stress, the uncertainty range of prior\nvelocity profiles at the leading edge covers the experimental data.

To complicate things, the pore-network at each scale exhibits\ndifferent permeability, and these networks are connected through fissure and\nconduits.

Promoting both the interface profile and the contact line position\nto random variables, we explore the equilibrium properties of the corresponding\nfluctuating contact line problem based on an interfacial Hamiltonian involving\na \"contact\" binding potential. To facilitate an analytical treatment we\nconsider the case of a one-dimensional interface. The effective boundary\ncondition at the contact line is determined by a dimensionless parameter that\nencodes the relative importance of thermal energy and substrate energy at the\nmicroscopic scale. We find that this parameter controls the transition from a\npartially wetting to a pseudo-partial wetting state, the latter being\ncharacterized by a thin prewetting film of fixed thickness. In the partial\nwetting regime, instead, the profile typically approaches the substrate via an\nexponentially thinning prewetting film. We show that, independently of the\nphysics at the microscopic scale, Young's angle is recovered sufficiently far\nfrom the substrate. The fluctuations of the interface and of the contact line\ngive rise to an effective disjoining pressure, exponentially decreasing with\nheight.

Moreover,\nsuspensions of elongated motile cells produce a form of active oriented matter.\nTo understand how these effects modify viscous propulsion, we extend Taylor's\nclassical model of small-amplitude zero-Reynolds-number propulsion of a\n'swimming sheet' via the transversely-isotropic fluid model of Ericksen, which\nis linear in strain rate and possesses a distinguished direction. The energetic\ncosts of swimming are significantly altered by all rheological parameters and\nthe initial fibre angle. Propulsion in a passive transversely-isotropic fluid\nproduces an enhanced mean rate of working, independent of the initial fibre\norientation, with an approximately linear dependence of energetic cost on the\nextensional and shear enhancements to the viscosity caused by fibres. In this\nregime the mean swimming velocity is unchanged from the Newtonian case.

Fixing the radiative damping and\nmomentum drag timescales to be of the order of a few days, a state of SR is\nshown to emerge under steady large-scale and random small-scale vorticity\nforcing. In the first example, the stationary response to a pair of equal and\noppositely signed vortices placed on the equator is considered. Here, the\nequatorial flux budget is dominated by the eddy fluxes and these drive the\nsystem into a state of SR. Eventually, the flux associated with the momentum\ndrag increases to balance the eddy fluxes, resulting in a steady state with a\nSR jet at the equator. The initial value problem with these twin vortices also\nexhibits SR driven by eddy fluxes. Curiously, this transient solution\nspontaneously propagates westward and continually circumnavigates the globe. It\nis worth emphasizing that this SR state does not rely on any particular form of\ndissipation at large scales, and is in fact observed even in the absence of any\nlarge-scale damping mechanism. In the second example, a random small-scale\nvorticity forcing is applied across the tropics.

New probabilistic\nconcepts are required to represent scalar boundary conditions at the walls: the\nboundary local-time density at points on the wall where scalar fluxes are\nimposed and the boundary first hitting-time at points where scalar values are\nimposed. These concepts are illustrated both by analytical results for the\nproblem of pure heat conduction and by numerical results from a database of\nchannel-flow flow turbulence, which also demonstrate the scalar mixing\nproperties of near-wall turbulence. As an application of the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation, we examine for wall-bounded flows the\nrelation between anomalous scalar dissipation and Lagrangian spontaneous\nstochasticity, i.e. the persistent non-determinism of Lagrangian particle\ntrajectories in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity.

In planar geometry, long-lived, depth-invariant\nstructures also form at large scales, but, in the absence of horizontal\nanisotropy, they consist of vortices that grow to the domain size. In this\nwork, through the introduction of horizontal anisotropy into a numerical model\nof planar rotating convection by the adoption of unequal horizontal box sizes\n(i.e. $L_x \\le L_y$, where the $xy$-plane is horizontal), we investigate\nwhether unidirectional flows and large-scale vortices can coexist. We find that\nonly a small degree of anisotropy is required to bring about a transition from\ndynamics dominated by persistent large-scale vortices to dynamics dominated by\npersistent unidirectional flows parallel to the shortest horizontal direction.\nWhen the anisotropy is sufficiently large, the unidirectional flow consists of\nmultiple jets, generated on a timescale smaller than a global viscous\ntimescale, thus signifying that the upscale energy transfer does not\nspontaneously feed the largest available mode in the system.

As for the dissipative term: first it explicitly\nbreaks time reversibility; second it produces a small-scale sink for the energy\ntransfer that remains effective even in the limit of vanishing viscosity.

In this\ninvestigation of high-$Ra$ porous media convection in a minimal flow unit, two\nreduced modeling strategies are proposed that exploit these specific flow\ncharacteristics. Both approaches utilize the idea of decomposition since the\nflow exhibits different dynamics in different regions of the domain:\nsmall-scale cellular motions generally are localized within the thermal and\nvorticity boundary layers near the upper and lower walls, while in the\ninterior, the flow exhibits persistent large-scale structures and only a few\nlow (horizontal) wavenumber Fourier modes are active.

Eulerian methods perform a voxel-based reconstruction\nof particles per time step, followed by 3D motion estimation, with some form of\ndense matching between the precomputed voxel grids from different time steps.\nIn this sequential procedure, the first step cannot use temporal consistency\nconsiderations to support the reconstruction, while the second step has no\naccess to the original, high-resolution image data. Alternatively, Lagrangian\nmethods reconstruct an explicit, sparse set of particles and track the\nindividual particles over time. Physical constraints can only be incorporated\nin a post-processing step when interpolating the particle tracks to a dense\nmotion field. We show, for the first time, how to jointly reconstruct both the\nindividual tracer particles and a dense 3D fluid motion field from the image\ndata, using an integrated energy minimization.

These\nregimes can be classified by either the importance of the streamline diffusion\nor by the interaction between bubbles. For small Pe the streamline diffusion is\nnot negligible as compared to convection whereas for large Pe, convection\ndominates in the streamline direction and, thus, crosswind diffusion becomes\ncrucial in governing the dissolution through boundary layers or of the\nremaining wake behind the bubbles.

The\nCME plays a key role in the evolution of magnetic fields since it results in a\ndynamo effect associated with an additional term in the induction equation.\nThis term is formally similar to the $\\alpha$ effect in classical mean-field\nMHD. However, the chiral dynamo can operate without turbulence and is\nassociated with small spatial scales that can be, in the case of the early\nUniverse, orders of magnitude below the Hubble radius.

Our\ntheoretical model, which we validate against Brownian dynamics simulations, is\napplied to unravel the roles of motility, fluid flow, and lattice geometry on\nasymptotic mean velocity and dispersivity.

Specifically, we consider a swimmer\nthat maintains a helical centreline and a single handedness while changing its\nhelix radius, pitch and wavelength uniformly across the body. We first discuss\nhow a deforming helix can create a non-reciprocal translational and rotational\nswimming stroke and identify its principle direction of motion. We then\ndetermine the leading-order physics for helices with small helix radius before\nconsidering the general behaviour for different configuration parameters and\nhow these swimmers can be optimised. Finally, we explore how the presence of\nwalls, gravity, and defects in the centreline allow the helical device to break\nsymmetries, increase its speed, and generate transport in directions not\navailable to helices in bulk fluids. \n\n"}

Varying the flow speed can give rise to a range of dynamics\nincluding limit cycle behaviour and chaotic motion of the cantilevered sheet.\nRecently, the \"inverted flag\" configuration - a cantilevered elastic sheet\naligned with the flow impinging on its free edge - has been observed to produce\nlarge-amplitude flapping over a finite band of flow speeds. This flapping\nphenomenon has been found to be a vortex-induced vibration, and only occurs at\nsufficiently large Reynolds numbers. In all cases studied, the inverted flag\nhas been formed from a cantilevered sheet of rectangular morphology, i.e. the\nplanform of its elastic sheet is a rectangle. Here, we investigate the effect\nof the inverted flag's morphology on its resulting stability and dynamics. We\nchoose a trapezoidal planform which is explored using experiment and an\nanalytical theory for the divergence instability of an inverted flag of\narbitrary morphology. Strikingly, for this planform we observe that the flow\nspeed range over which flapping occurs scales approximately with the flow speed\nat which the divergence instability occurs. This provides a means by which to\npredict and control flapping. In a biological setting, leaves in a wind can\nalso align themselves in an inverted flag configuration. Motivated by this\nnatural occurrence we also study the effect of adding an artificial \"petiole\"\n(a thin elastic stalk that connects the sheet to the clamp) on the inverted\nflag's dynamics.

In this work, we focus on non-Brownian shear-dominated suspensions,\nwhere kinetic collisions are negligible and frictional effects play a dominant\nrole. Under these circumstances, irreversible phenomena such as particle\ndiffusion and migration arise, requiring anisotropic stress models to describe\nthe suspension rheology. On a continuum level, reduced-order models such as the\nsuspension balance model (SBM) or the diffusive flux model are commonly used to\npredict particle migration phenomena. We propose a new method based on a\ntwo-fluid model (TFM), where both the phases are considered as interpenetrating\ncontinua with their own conservation of mass and momentum equations. Without\nemploying the nowadays customary simplifications in applying the SBM, we close\nthe ``full'' TFM instead.

Aims: Our goal is to\ncompute turbulent viscosity and magnetic diffusivity, relevant for diffusing\nlarge-scale flows and magnetic fields, respectively, and their ratio, the\nturbulent magnetic Prandtl number, ${\\rm Pm}_{\\rm t}$, for isotropically forced\nhomogeneous turbulence. Methods: We use simulations of forced turbulence in\nfully periodic cubes composed of isothermal gas with an imposed large-scale\nsinusoidal shear flow. Turbulent viscosity is computed either from the\nresulting Reynolds stress or from the decay rate of the large-scale flow.\nTurbulent magnetic diffusivity is computed using the test-field method. The\nscale dependence of the coefficients is studied by varying the wavenumber of\nthe imposed sinusoidal shear and test fields. Results: We find that turbulent\nviscosity and magnetic diffusivity are in general of the same order of\nmagnitude. Furthermore, the turbulent viscosity depends on the fluid Reynolds\nnumber (${\\rm Re}$) and scale separation ratio of turbulence. The scale\ndependence of the turbulent viscosity is found to be well approximated by a\nLorentzian. The results for the turbulent transport coefficients appear to\nconverge at sufficiently high values of ${\\rm Re}$ and the scale separation\nratio.

On the other hand, while\nmeshless methods have been widely used in both cosmology, galactic dynamics,\nand planet formation they have not been fully deployed on the MRI problem.

In the present work, we\nstudy the effect of viscoelasticity and compressibility over a localized vortex\nstructure and multiple rotational vortexes in a strongly coupled viscoelastic\ndusty plasma medium. In case of single rotating vortex flow, a transverse wave\nis generated from the localized vortex source and the evolution time of\ngenerated waves is found to be reduced due to finite viscoelasticity and\ncompressibility of the medium. It is found that the viscoelasticity suppresses\nthe dispersion of vorticity.

Four examples of active scalar have\nbeen considered: temperature in thermal convection, magnetic potential in\ntwo-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics, vorticity in two-dimensional Ekman\nturbulence and potential temperature in surface flows. In the cases of\ntemperature and vorticity, it is found that the active scalar behavior is akin\nto that of its co-evolving passive counterpart. The two other cases indicate\nthat this similarity is in fact not generic and differences between passive and\nactive fields can be striking: in two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics the\nmagnetic potential performs an inverse cascade while the passive scalar\ncascades toward the small-scales; in surface flows, albeit both perform a\ndirect cascade, the potential temperature and the passive scalar have different\nscaling laws already at the level of low-order statistical objects.

Using\nnearest neighbor, one-dimensional Cellular Automata (CA) as an example, we show\nhow to construct local coarse-grained descriptions of CA in all classes of\nWolfram's classification. The resulting coarse-grained CA that we construct are\ncapable of emulating the large-scale behavior of the original systems without\naccounting for small-scale details. Several CA that can be coarse-grained by\nthis construction are known to be universal Turing machines; they can emulate\nany CA or other computing devices and are therefore undecidable. We thus show\nthat because in practice one only seeks coarse-grained information, complex\nphysical systems can be predictable and even decidable at some level of\ndescription. The renormalization group flows that we construct induce a\nhierarchy of CA rules. This hierarchy agrees well with apparent rule complexity\nand is therefore a good candidate for a complexity measure and a classification\nmethod. Finally we argue that the large scale dynamics of CA can be very\nsimple, at least when measured by the Kolmogorov complexity of the large scale\nupdate rule, and moreover exhibits a novel scaling law. We show that because of\nthis large-scale simplicity, the probability of finding a coarse-grained\ndescription of CA approaches unity as one goes to increasingly coarser scales.\nWe interpret this large scale simplicity as a pattern formation mechanism in\nwhich large scale patterns are forced upon the system by the simplicity of the\nrules that govern the large scale dynamics. \n\n"}

A simple\nimpeller model drives a flow which can generate a growing magnetic field,\ndepending upon the magnetic Reynolds number, Rm, and the fluid Reynolds number.\nWhen the flow is laminar, the dynamo transition is governed by a simple\nthreshold in Rm, above which a growing magnetic eigenmode is observed. The\neigenmode is primarily a dipole field tranverse to axis of symmetry of the\nflow. In saturation the Lorentz force slows the flow such that the magnetic\neigenmode becomes marginally stable. For turbulent flow, the dynamo eigenmode\nis suppressed. The mechanism of suppression is due to a combination of a time\nvarying large-scale field and the presence of fluctuation driven currents which\neffectively enhance the magnetic diffusivity. For higher Rm a dynamo reappears,\nhowever the structure of the magnetic field is often different from the laminar\ndynamo; it is dominated by a dipolar magnetic field which is aligned with the\naxis of symmetry of the mean-flow, apparently generated by fluctuation-driven\ncurrents. The fluctuation-driven currents have been studied by applying a weak\nmagnetic field to laminar and turbulent flows. The magnetic fields generated by\nthe fluctuations are significant: a dipole moment aligned with the symmetry\naxis of the mean-flow is generated similar to those observed in the experiment,\nand both toroidal and poloidal flux expulsion are observed. \n\n"}
