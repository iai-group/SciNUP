Although the stability of the operator product expansion side seems\nto break down at T > 1.06Tc for the vector channel and T>1.04Tc for the\npseudoscalar channel, we find a sudden change of the spectral property across\nthe critical temperature Tc, which originates from an equally rapid change of\nthe scalar gluon condensate characterized by e-3p.

I demonstrate that\nunder quite natural assumptions about the dynamics of heavy ion collisions this\nleads to a universal (i.e. independent of the initial parton energy, but\ndependent on flavor and centrality) upper bound on the energy of the partons\nescaping from the plasma. This bound is a Yang--Mills analog of the Pomeranchuk\nbound in classical electrodynamics, where it is a consequence of radiation in a\nstrong external field acting on a relativistic charge. Since as a result the\nmassive constituent partons are slowed down to a velocity v < c, the angular\ndistribution of the emitted radiation exhibits a broad \"dead cone\". If the\nproperties of conformal and QCD matter at strong coupling are qualitatively\nsimilar, the existence of this universal upper bound would have dramatic\nimplications for heavy ion experiments. \n\n"}

Measurements and comparison with relativistic hydrodynamic models\nindicate that the matter thermalizes in an unexpectedly short time, has an\nenergy density at least 15 times larger than needed for color deconfinement,\nhas a temperature about twice the critical temperature predicted by lattice\nQCD, and appears to exhibit collective motion with ideal hydrodynamic\nproperties - a \"perfect liquid\" that appears to flow with a near-zero viscosity\nto entropy ratio - lower than any previously observed fluid and perhaps close\nto a universal lower bound. However, a fundamental understanding of the medium\nseen in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC does not yet exist. The most important\nscientific challenge for the field in the next decade is the quantitative\nexploration of the new state of nuclear matter.

This hybrid approach is based on the Ultra-relativistic\nQuantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport approach with an intermediate\nhydrodynamical evolution for the hot and dense stage of the collision.\nEvent-by-event fluctuations are directly taken into account via the\nnon-equilibrium initial conditions generated by the initial collisions and\nstring fragmentations in the microscopic UrQMD model. After a (3+1)-dimensional\nideal hydrodynamic evolution, the hydrodynamical fields are mapped to hadrons\nvia the Cooper-Frye equation and the subsequent hadronic cascade calculation\nwithin UrQMD proceeds to incorporate the important final state effects for a\nrealistic freeze-out. This implementation allows to compare pure microscopic\ntransport calculations with hydrodynamic calculations using exactly the same\ninitial conditions and freeze-out procedure. The effects of the change in the\nunderlying dynamics - ideal fluid dynamics vs. non-equilibrium transport theory\n- will be explored. The freeze-out and initial state parameter dependences are\ninvestigated for different observables. Furthermore, the time evolution of the\nbaryon density and particle yields are discussed. We find that the final pion\nand proton multiplicities are lower in the hybrid model calculation due to the\nisentropic hydrodynamic expansion while the yields for strange particles are\nenhanced due to the local equilibrium in the hydrodynamic evolution. The\nresults of the different calculations for the mean transverse mass excitation\nfunction, rapidity and transverse mass spectra for different particle species\nat three different beam energies are discussed in the context of the available\ndata. \n\n"}

Results obtained are\ncompared with previous results from $l_i \\to l_j l_k \\bar l_l$, $l_i \\to l_j\n\\gamma$, $Z \\to l \\bar l'$ and $\\mu - e$ conversion. Our results show that the\nmost stringent constraint on the $e$-to-$\\tau$ FCNC effect comes from $\\tau \\to\n\\pi^0 e$ decay. $\\tau \\to \\rho^0 \\mu$ and $\\tau \\to \\pi^0 \\mu$ give very\nstringent constraints on the $\\mu$-to-$\\tau$ FCNC effect, comparable with that\nobtained from $\\tau \\to \\mu \\bar \\mu \\mu$ studied previously. The constraint on\nthe $e$-to-$\\mu$ FCNC effect from processes considered in this work is much\nweaker than that obtained from processes studies previously, in particular that\nfrom $\\mu - e$ conversion in atomic nuclei. We find that in the canonical\nseesaw models the FCNC parameters, due to tiny neutrino masses, are all\npredicted to be much smaller than the constraints obtained here, making such\nmodels irrelevant. However, we also find that in certain special circumstances\nthe tiny neutrino masses do not directly constrain the FCNC parameters. In\nthese situations, the constraints from the FCNC studies can still play\nimportant roles. \n\n"}

Taking into account constraints from low- and\nhigh-energy, parity-conserving electroproduction measurements, choosing\ndifferent models for contributions from the non-resonant processes, and\nperforming the corresponding flavor rotations to obtain the electroweak\namplitude, we arrive at an estimate of the uncertainty in the total\ncontribution to the parity-violating asymmetry.

In order\nto control the effects of surface contamination, we developed a novel technique\nthat uses composite macro-bolometers to identify energy depositions that occur\nclose to the surfaces of materials immediately surrounding the detector. The\ncomposite macro-bolometer proposed and studied here consists of a main energy\nabsorber that is thermally coupled to and entirely surrounded by thin absorbers\nthat act as active shields. Surface energy depositions can be rejected by the\nanalysis of simultaneous signals in the main absorber and the shields.

To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the\npropagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we\nadopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the $(1+1)$\nquasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of\nthe coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of\n\"mesons\" with a finite mass and the screening of \"quark\" charge that are\ncrucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons.

We argue that the low energy relations representing the\nquantum anomalies of QCD are saturated by coherent low dimensional vacuum\nconfigurations as observed in Monte Carlo lattice studies. The thermal spectrum\nand approximate universality of the temperature with no dependence on energy of\ncolliding particles in this framework is due to the fact that the emission\nresults from the distortion of these low dimensional vacuum sheets rather than\nfrom the colliding particles themselves. The emergence of the long- range\ncorrelations of P odd domains (a feature which is apparently required for\nexplanation of the asymmetry observed at RHIC and LHC) is also a result of the\nsame distortion of the QCD vacuum configurations. We formulate the\ncorresponding physics using the effective low energy effective Lagrangian.

This leads to a factorization\nof the distribution function of the proton, neutron, and their antiparticles in\nthe final state with binomial distribution functions. Using the factorization,\nwe derive formulas to determine nucleon number cumulants, which are not direct\nexperimental observables, from proton number fluctuations, which are\nexperimentally observable in event-by-event analyses. With a simple treatment\nfor strange baryons, the nucleon number cumulants are further promoted to the\nbaryon number ones.

Quench is implemented by evolving this initial configuration with the\neffective potential at a temperature $T > T_c$. We study the formation of Z(3)\ndomain structure and its evolution during the transition as $l$ rolls down in\ndifferent directions from the top of the central hill in the effective\npotential of $l$. When explicit Z(3) symmetry breaking effects (arising from\ndynamical quark effects) are small, then we find well defined Z(3) domains\nwhich coarsen in time. Remarkably, the magnitude plot of $l$ shows vacuum\nbubble like configurations arising during the quench. This first order\ntransition like behavior occurs even though there is no metastable vacuum\nseparated by a barrier from the true vacuum for the parameter values used. When\nthe initial field configuration everywhere rolls down roughly along the same\ndirection (as will happen with large explicit symmetry breaking) then we do not\nfind such bubble-like configurations.

{"id": "1311.4929", "contents": "Title: Relativistic mean field plus exact pairing approach to open shell nuclei Abstract: Background: Pairing correlations play a critical role in determining numerous\nproperties of open-shell nuclei. Traditionally, they are included in a\nmean-field description of atomic nuclei through the approximate\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer or Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism. Purpose: We\npropose a new hybrid ''relativistic-mean-field-plus-pairing'' approach in which\npairing is treated exactly so the number of particles is conserved. To verify\nthe reliability of the formalism, we apply it to the study of both ground-state\nproperties and isoscalar monopole excitations of the Tin isotopes. Methods:\nAccurately-calibrated relativistic mean-field models supplemented by an exact\ntreatment of pairing correlations are used to compute ground-state observables\nalong the isotopic chain in Tin. In turn, ground-state densities are used as\ninput to the calculation of giant monopole resonances through a\nconstrained-relativistic approach. Results: We compute a variety of\nground-state observables sensitive to pairing correlations as well as the\nevolution of giant monopole energies along the isotopic chain in Tin. Whereas\nground-state properties are consistent with experiment, we find that pairing\ncorrelations have a minor effect on the giant monopole energies. Conclusions: A\nnew mean-field-plus-pairing approach is introduced to compute properties of\nopen-shell nuclei. The formalism provides an efficient and powerful alternative\nto the computation of both ground-state properties and monopole energies of\nopen-shell nuclei. We find ground-state properties to be well reproduced in\nthis approach. However, as many have concluded before us, we find that pairing\ncorrelations are unlikely to provide an answer to the question of ''why is Tin\nso soft?'' \n\n"}

The retardation\nspectrometer aSPECT consists, inter alia, of a superconducting magnet system\nthat produces a strong longitudinal magnetic field of up to 6.2T. In order not\nto disturb other experiments in the vicinity of aSPECT, we had to develop a\nmagnetic field return yoke for the magnet system. While the return yoke must\nreduce the stray magnetic field, the internal magnetic field and its\nhomogeneity should not be affected. As in many cases, the magnetic shielding\nfor aSPECT must manage with limited space. In addition, we must ensure that the\nadditional magnetic forces on the magnet coils are not destructive. In order to\ndetermine the most suitable geometry for the magnetic shielding for aSPECT, we\nsimulated a variety of possible geometries and combinations of shielding\nmaterials of non-linear permeability. The results of our simulations were\nchecked through magnetic field measurements both with Hall and nuclear magnetic\nresonance probes.

We fill this gap by\nperforming an optimization and statistical analysis of all the low-energy\nconstants (LECs) up to next-to-next-to-leading order. Our optimization protocol\ncorresponds to a simultaneous fit to scattering and bound-state observables in\nthe pion-nucleon, nucleon-nucleon, and few-nucleon sectors, thereby utilizing\nthe full model capabilities of chiEFT.

This occurs due to the reduction of\nsoft particle production caused by a depletion of energy available in a nucleon\n(of the deuteron in the case of d-Au collisions), after the production of a\nhard jet. This represents a form of \"color transparency\" of the projectile\nnucleon, which has fluctuated to a state with fewer and harder partons, in\nevents which lead to jet production. We conclude with discussions of the form\nof multi-parton correlations in a nucleon which may be responsible for such a\nstartling effect. \n\n"}

Both initial and final state\neffects may lead to qualitatively similar phenomena in the observables of\ninterest.

They are\nexpected to be useful to produce neutron-rich unstable nuclei. Nuclear dynamics\nleading to these processes depends sensitively on nuclear properties such as\ndeformation and shell structure. Purpose: We elucidate reaction mechanisms of\nMNT and QF processes involving heavy deformed nuclei, making detailed\ncomparisons between microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations\nand measurements for the $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. Methods:\nThree-dimensional Skyrme-TDHF calculations are performed. Particle-number\nprojection method is used to evaluate MNT cross sections from the TDHF wave\nfunction after collision. Results: Fragment masses, total kinetic energy (TKE),\nscattering angle, contact time, and MNT cross sections are investigated for the\n$^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction.

At LHC and top RHIC\nenergies, QCD matter is studied at very high temperatures and nearly vanishing\nnet-baryon densities. There is evidence that a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) was\ncreated at experiments at RHIC and LHC. The transition from the QGP back to the\nhadron gas is found to be a smooth cross over. For larger net-baryon densities\nand lower temperatures, it is expected that the QCD phase diagram exhibits a\nrich structure, such as a first-order phase transition between hadronic and\npartonic matter which terminates in a critical point, or exotic phases like\nquarkyonic matter. The discovery of these landmarks would be a breakthrough in\nour understanding of the strong interaction and is therefore in the focus of\nvarious high-energy heavy-ion research programs. The Compressed Baryonic Matter\n(CBM) experiment at FAIR will play a unique role in the exploration of the QCD\nphase diagram in the region of high net-baryon densities, because it is\ndesigned to run at unprecedented interaction rates. High-rate operation is the\nkey prerequisite for high-precision measurements of multi-differential\nobservables and of rare diagnostic probes which are sensitive to the dense\nphase of the nuclear fireball.

The results are strikingly similar to those measured at\nthe same particle multiplicity in Pb+Pb collisions, which have been attributed\nto the CME. This similarity, combined with two key assumptions about the\nmagnetic field in p+Pb collisions, presents a major challenge to the CME\npicture. These two assumptions as stated in the CMS paper are (1) that the\nmagnetic field in p+Pb collisions is smaller than that in Pb+Pb collisions and\n(2) that the magnetic field direction is uncorrelated with the flow angle.

Next, the produced partons hadronize in a non-perturbative\nway later in a hadronization process. The jet fragmentation can be studied\nusing the method of two particle correlations. A useful observable is the jet\ntransverse fragmentation momentum $j_{\\mathrm{T}}$, which describes the angular\nwidth of the jet.

Such analyses predict the\npresence of nonpointlike, electromagnetically-active quark-quark (diquark)\ncorrelations within all baryons; and in these doublets, isoscalar-scalar,\nisovector-pseudovector, isoscalar-pseudoscalar, and vector diquarks can all\nplay a role. In the two lightest $(1/2,1/2^+)$ doublets, however, scalar and\npseudovector diquarks are overwhelmingly dominant. The associated rest-frame\nwave functions are largely $S$-wave in nature; and the first excited state in\nthis $1/2^+$ channel has the appearance of a radial excitation of the ground\nstate. The two lightest $(1/2,1/2^-)$ doublets fit a different picture:\naccurate estimates of their masses are obtained by retaining only pseudovector\ndiquarks; in their rest frames, the amplitudes describing their dressed-quark\ncores contain roughly equal fractions of even- and odd-parity diquarks; and the\nassociated wave functions are predominantly $P$-wave in nature, but possess\nmeasurable $S$-wave components. Moreover, the first excited state in each\nnegative-parity channel has little of the appearance of a radial excitation. In\nquantum field theory, all differences between positive- and negative-parity\nchannels must owe to chiral symmetry breaking, which is overwhelmingly\ndynamical in the light-quark sector.

However, contrary to the naive expectation, the hydrodynamics-type\nflow is found to contribute more to the final state charm $v_{2}$ than light\nquark $v_{2}$. This could be explained by the smaller average deflection angle\nthe heavier charm quark undergoes in each collision, so that heavy quarks need\nmore scatterings to accumulate a significant $v_{2}$, while lighter quarks can\nmore easily change directions with scatterings with their $v_{2}$ coming more\nfrom the escape mechanism. Our finding thus suggests that the charm $v_{2}$ is\na better probe for studying the hydrodynamic properties of the quark-gluon\nplasma. \n\n"}

Such processes can be coherent provided\nthat the net electron recoil momentum, i.e. the momentum transfer from the\nneutrino minus the momentum of the emitted photon, is sufficiently small. The\nradiative processes is an attractive possibility as the energy of the emitted\nphotons can be as large as the momentum transfer to the electron system and\ntherefore the problem of detecting extremely low energy recoils can be avoided.\nThe requirement of macroscopic coherence severely constrains the phase space\navailable for the scattered particle and the emitted photon.

It is well known, however, that\nthe quenching of jets from their interaction with the medium leads to a\nmigration of jets from higher to lower $p_T$, making it challenging to directly\ninfer the degree and mechanism of jet energy loss. Our proposed quantile\nmatching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate\nmonotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$).

In a naive picture the latter are directly related to the impact\nparameter of the two nuclei, which sets also the initial eccentricity of the\nsystem: zero in the case of the most central events and getting larger for more\nperipheral collisions. A more realistic modelling requires to take into account\nevent-by-event fluctuations, in particular in the nucleon positions within the\ncolliding nuclei: collisions belonging to the same centrality class can give\nrise to systems with different initial eccentricity and hence different flow\nharmonics for the final hadron distributions.

Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the parity doublet structure seen in the\nspectrum of highly excited baryons may be due to effective chiral symmetry\nrestoration for these states. We review the recent developments in this field.\nWe demonstrate with a simple quantum-mechanical example that it is a very\nnatural property of quantum systems that a symmetry breaking effect which is\nimportant for the low-lying spectrum of the system, can become unimportant for\nthe highly-lying states; the highly lying states reveal a multiplet structure\nof nearly degenerate states. Using the well established concepts of\nquark-hadron duality, asymptotic freedom in QCD and validity of the operator\nproduct expansion in QCD we show that the spectral densities obtained with the\nlocal currents that are connected to each other via chiral transformations,\nvery high in the spectrum must coincide. Hence effects of spontaneous breaking\nof chiral symmetry in QCD vacuum that are crucially important for the low-lying\nspectra, become irrelevant for the highly-lying states. Then to the extent that\nidentifiable hadronic resonances still exist in the continuum spectrum at high\nexcitations this implies that the highly excited hadrons must fall into\nmultiplets associated with the representations of the chiral group. We\ndemonstrate that this is indeed the case for meson spectra in the large $N_c$\nlimit. All possible parity-chiral multiplets are classified for baryons and it\nis demonstrated that the existing data on highly excited $N$ and $\\Delta$\nstates at masses of 2 GeV and higher is consistent with approximate chiral\nsymmetry restoration.

The up and down quarks lie at the\ncorners of the diamond while the anti-strange quark sits in the center. Various\nun-excited color flux tubes between the five quarks bind them into a stable and\nnarrow color-singlet. Such a configuration allows the lowest state having the\nnegative parity naturally. The decay of the $\\Theta_5$ pentaquark into the\nnucleon and kaon requires the breakup of the non-planar diamond configuration\ninto two conventional planar hadrons, which involves some kind of structural\nphase transition as in the condensed matter physics.
